AB Carbon fiber recycling has garnered significant attention in recent years due to the large volume of manufacturing waste and upcoming end-of-life products that will enter the waste stream as the current generation of aircraft is retired from service. Recycled carbon fibers have been shown to retain most of their virgin mechanical properties, but their length is generally reduced such that continuous fiber laminates cannot be remade. As such, these fibers are typically used in low-performance applications including injection molding, extrusion/compression molding, and 3D printing that further degrade the fiber length and resulting composite properties. However, recent advances in the processing of long discontinuous fiber textiles have led to medium- to high-performance composites using recycled carbon fibers. This review paper describes the recent advances in recycled carbon fiber textile processing that have made these improvements possible. The techniques used to manufacture high-value polymer composites reinforced with discontinuous recycled carbon fiber are described. The resulting mechanical and multifunctional properties are also discussed to illustrate the advantages of these new textile-based recycled fiber composites over the prior art.

ID CIRCULAR ECONOMY; SUSTAINABILITY; EVOLUTION
AB The potential of additive manufacturing (AM) for distributed production is often mentioned as an enabler for sustainable manufacturing within a circular economy. Currently, even if manufacturing with AM is distributed, the used materials can rarely be acquired locally and are usually obtained from a centralized location. Addressing this issue, we are developing an approach that supports the search for local materials that are suitable as material input for AM and are recyclable to serve multiple product lifecycles. The approach is an iterative process consisting of four phases; "material in AM context", "recycling opportunities", "material property testing", and "application possibilities". As an initial example, we present a process to adapt mussel shell waste into AM material. Mussel shells are a voluminous waste stream in the Netherlands. The shells, which mainly exist of calcium carbonate, are ground into a powder and combined with sugar water. Using a modified material extrusion process, 3D objects are created. In this paper, we discuss the iterations through our approach and illustrate the initial 3D printed results. With this project, we intend to demonstrate the potential of using local waste streams for AM processes for a circular economy. This is a first step towards the development of a methodology for linking local material streams to novel AM processes and meaningful applications.

TI Bending and shear improvements in 3D-printed core sandwich composites
   through modification of resin uptake in the skin/core interphase region

ID BEHAVIOR; FOAM; TOUGHNESS
AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) printed polymers are rarely used as a structural material due to anisotropic and low mechanical properties compared with conventional composites. In recent years, greater need has been expressed for recycling of materials, such as recyclable FDM, at the end of service life to reduce environmental pollution and manufacture cost. However, how the amount of resin uptake in the skin and skin/core interphase affects the bending and shear performance of the sandwich composites when replacing the low strength and ductile core (conventional core) with a high strength and brittle core (FDM printed PLA (polylactic acid) core) still remains unclear. A new manufacturing routine is needed to improve the incorporation of FDM printed polymers in composite structures. In this work, FDM printed PLA was used as core material and sandwiched between two unidirectional glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) skins to form a sandwich composite by compression-molding (CM) process, which provides a good manufacturing strategy for skin/core interphase modification. The significance of the CM process is proved by investigating the effect of resin uptake on bending and in-plane/out-of-plane shear performances. Current first order shear deformation (FSDT) theory lacks a direct connection between the in-plane shear stress and out-of-shear stress in the core region of sandwich composites. With the help of DIC, a connection between the in-plane shear and the out-of-plane shear strain was built and in plane shear properties can acquire through out-of-plane shear properties, hence reducing the redundancy of sample preparation or the need for simulation. A significant improvement was found compared with the optimized resin uptake (Optimized resin uptake range: 20.43%-22.86 wt%) 3D-printed PLA core sandwich composite and lowest performance sandwich composite (Improvement: in-plane shear strength (-34%)/modulus (-29%), out-of-plane shear strength (-25%)/modulus (-31%), specific peak bending load (-19%)). Compared with balsa core sandwich composites, the 3D-printed cores are suitable for use in composite sandwich structures in many applications with a satisfactory strength-to-weight ratio.

AB Advanced composite materials (ACMs), especially nanoparticle-reinforced polymer composites (NpRPCs), exhibit desirable physical and chemical properties that include low density coupled with directed high stiffness and strength, optimal dimensional stability, superior temperature, and chemical resistance, as well as relatively cost-efficient manufacturing. Successful manufacturing of high-performance nanocomposites depends on the precise control of processing factors, including (i) uniform dispersion of the nanoparticles, (ii) effective matrixfiller interfacial interactions at the molecular level, and (iii) alignment/orientation of the nanoparticle and/or polymer chains. This study highlights a newly designed nozzle for multilayer composite structure fabrication using thermoplastic and thermoset polymers, as well as nanoparticles of various morphologies (e.g., 1D and 2D), which have been used for the scalable fabrication of 1D fibers, 2D coatings, and 3D architectures via 3D printing. Discussion of the nozzle design, layer formation mechanism, and fabrication of functional structures of 1D, 2D, and 3D morphologies will be the focus of this talk. The demonstrations in structural supports, thermal dissipations, electrical conductors, plastics recycling, stimuli-responsive systems, and tissue scaffolds show massive potential in national defense, space exploration, energy storage, and human health.

AB Implementation of computer simulation analysis of proposed Temephos submerged dispensers designated as "Floater 1" and "Floater 2" presented in this study contributes to a body of research on the types of interventions used to prevent mosquito-borne diseases. Floaters 1 and 2 are known as cage and cylindrical design, respectively. Modal analysis conducted on both design enabled the authors to further understand and visualize the deformation and stress distribution which correspond to natural frequency of each design. Obtained natural frequency of these dispensers could avoid destructive frequencies caused by external loads acting on both designs. Furthermore, costs related to destructive testing and manufacturing defects would literally be avoided. Hence, a more robust and affordable mosquito control product will potentially be materialized. Combined usage of these submerged dispensers made of polylactic acid (PLA), an environmentally friendly plastic printed via 3D printing with reused or recycled plastic material will gain a widespread use and contribute to the environmental sustainability.

AB Embedding immobilized lipase (IL) enzymes into polycaprolactone (PCL) matrix was demonstrated as a promising route to faster biodegradable and chemically recyclable PCL products. Furthermore, the materials could be thermally processed by extrusion and 3D printed by fused filament fabrication technique. The embeddedenzymes were shown to effectively accelerate the degradation of PCL under simulated industrial composting conditions and in aqueous solution in combination with external enzymes. To reveal deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms, the biodegradation kinetic parameters governing organic carbon (OC) mineralization were calculated. Furthermore, the concept of biodegradation half-life ( B 1/2 ) was introduced and correlated with the organic carbon (OC) mineralization rate of enzyme-embedded PCL films and filaments, especially under thermophilic composting conditions. This sheds light on how the incorporation of immobilized enzymes into PCL facilitates the degradation process. Furthermore, the feasibility of enzyme-catalyzed chemical recycling under mild conditions followed by enzyme-catalyzed repolymerization was demonstrated. The applied material design principle holds promise for addressing the pressing challenges associated with plastic waste, when moving forward towards a more sustainable and environmentally conscious future.

AB Additive manufacturing encounters significant barriers to its broader application in large-scale production. This research seeks to mitigate critical limitations, including a trade-off between impregnation speed and quality in filament preparation and inconsistent fiber distribution in continuous carbon filaments (CCFs), mainly attributed to the rounding process of unidirectional tapes and insufficient interlayer adhesion. A novel lab-scale impregnation line was engineered to address these challenges, facilitating the production of CCFs using three distinct types of carbon fiber in conjunction with recycled glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPETG) resin. This new lab-scale process produces uniform fiber distribution within PETG matrix and prevents S-shaped distortions typically observed in conventionally rounded tapes. The type of carbon fiber sizing influences the impregnation process and tensile strength of the CCFs. Specifically, CCFs with flexible sizing demonstrated a 15% reduction in tensile strength due to fuzz formation during impregnation. These CCFs were subsequently employed in 3D printing applications, with the fabricated composite components subjected to interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) testing. The study concludes that recycled PETG is a viable additive manufacturing material when combined with appropriately sized carbon fibers. Additionally, it highlights the advantages of omitting the rounding stage, which enhances the quality of CCF and optimizes production efficiency.Highlights A lab-scale direct melt impregnation system was designed in this study. The impact of different sizing types on carbon fibers was investigated. 3D-printed continuous fiber filaments were prepared. New lab-scale process produces uniform fiber distribution within PETG matrix. S-shaped distortions observed in conventionally rounded tapes were prevented.

AB This study introduces the innovative method of in-situ precipitation (ISP) 3D printing technology for fabricating photocatalyst structures capable of efficiently degrading water pollutants. The technology involves using silver nitrate aqueous solution to print directly on the surface of solidified NaBr aqueous solution, resulting in the formation of regular porous silver bromide structures. The structures are then densified through drying and sintering, followed by photoreduction using ultraviolet radiation to create Ag@(silver atom cluster)AgBr pho-tocatalyst structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this photocatalyst structure in degrading azo dyes (Orange II) and eliminating Escherichia coli (E. coli) under visible light and ultraviolet light irradiation. The degradation of azo dyes and the sterilization of E. coli follow first-order kinetic reactions, with the photocatalyst module maintaining an 84.8% degradation rate after five recycling cycles. Complete elimi-nation E. coli of the photocatalytic module is achieved within 120 min, and its sterilization effect follows a hyperbolic reaction. The study further confirms the durability and reusability of the photocatalyst structure, highlighting ISP 3D printing technology as a promising approach for fabricating efficient photocatalyst structures to address water pollution challenges in water treatment and environmental protection.

ID IMPACT
AB The European Union's Green Deal emphasizes life science and biotechnology as key drivers for achieving a circular economy. However, the prevalent use of non-sustainable single-use plastics derived from petrochemical sources in life science research and development contradicts this ecological goal. This study presents a viable alternative through on-site sterile 3D printing of single-use plastics using poly(lactic acid) (PLA). The sterile printing of PLA demonstrates a substantial reduction in CO2eq emissions per shake flask, decreasing from 260 g CO2eq to 145 g CO2eq. Suitability for cell culture was demonstrated for sterile printed PLA, autoclaved high-temperature PLA and for suspension cell cultures in shake flasks using CHO and insect cells as well as adherent Vero cell cultures in cell culture wells. Further optimization of sustainable shake flasks is achieved by utilizing recycled PLA, resulting in a remarkable reduction to 73 g CO2eq, constituting a 72% decrease in CO2eq emissions compared to conventional single-use plastics. Moreover, by employing geometric optimization to minimize material usage, emissions can be further reduced to 44 g CO2eq, representing an 83% reduction in CO2eq emissions. Anticipated advancements in PLA production suggest future carbon net negative PLA production, potentially achieving zero carbon emissions for single-use plastics using PLA. The exceptionally cost-effective nature of 3D printed single-use plastics, coupled with negligible capital costs for implementation, positions sterile 3D printing as a practical solution aligned with the 2030 Green Deal goals. Moreover, ongoing improvements in bioplastic production underscore the feasibility of meeting the 2050 targets of carbon neutrality for single-use plastics in life science research and development.

AB Designing and making sustainable plastics is especially urgent to reduce their ecological and environmental impacts. However, it remains challenging to construct plastics with simultaneous high sustainability and outstanding comprehensive performance. Here, a composite strategy of in situ polymerizing a petroleum-based monomer with the presence of an industrialized bio-derived polymer in a quasi-solvent-free system is introduced, affording the plastic with excellent mechanical robustness, impressive thermal and solvent stability, as well as low energy, consumes during production, processing, and recycling. Particularly, the plastic can be easily processed into diverse shapes through 3D printing, injection molding, etc. during polymerization and further reprocessed into other complex structures via eco-friendly hydrosetting. In addition, the plastic is mechanically robust with Young's modulus of up to 3.7 GPa and tensile breaking strength of up to 150.2 MPa, superior to many commercially available plastics and other sustainable plastics. It is revealed that hierarchical hydrogen bonds in plastic predominate the well-balanced sustainability and performance. This work provides a new path for fabricating high-performance sustainable plastic toward practical applications, contributing to the circular economy.
   Sustainable plastic is achieved with excellent mechanical robustness, impressive thermal and solvent stability as well as low energy consumption during production, processing, and recycling. The plastic can be easily processed into diverse shapes via 3D printing, injection molding, hydrosetting, etc. Meanwhile, the plastic shows E up to 3.7 GPa and sigma b up to 150.2 MPa, superior to many commercially available plastics and other sustainable plastics. image

DT Article
DE foamed concrete (FC); foam stability; foam lifetime; lightweight
   concrete; foaming agents; foam stabilization
AB This study examines the pore structure and distribution in 3D printed and cast foamed concrete using protein-based and synthetic foaming agents alongside various stabilizing additives. In 3D printed samples, pores are irregular and flattened due to mechanical forces during printing, whereas cast samples display uniform, spherical pores from homogeneous foam distribution. Samples containing the CA stabilizer show higher apparent densities (up to 2.05 g/cm3 for printed samples), correlating with lower water absorption. Protein-based foaming agents (PS) produce smaller, more evenly distributed pores, while synthetic agents (AS) result in larger, less uniform pores. Stabilizers significantly influence pore characteristics: commercial stabilizers yield smaller, more uniform pores, while recycled industrial oil (UO) leads to larger, more variable pores. Protein-based agents improve structural stability and reduce water absorption through uniform pore distributions, while synthetic agents lower density and increase water absorption. The highest sorption values were observed in samples with AS without stabilizer (1.7 kg/m2h1/2) and AS and UO (1.6 kg/m2h1/2) in a vertical orientation, with the horizontal orientation of sample AS and UO achieving a peak value of 2.0 kg/m2h1/2. Moreover, stabilization using UO resulted in higher sorption coefficients than stabilization with CA. High porosity in M1 resulted in low strength (0.2 MPa bending, 0.1 MPa perpendicular compression), while M5 showed superior performance (11.5 MPa perpendicular compression). PS-foamed samples (M4, M6) with uniform pores had the highest strengths, with M6 achieving 3.8 MPa bending and 10.3 MPa perpendicular compression. Perpendicular compression (M5: 11.5 MPa) was up to three times stronger than parallel compression due to weak interlayer bonds in 3D printing.

AB This study presents an open source method for detecting 3D printing anomalies by comparing images of printed layers from a stationary monocular camera with G-code-based reference images of an ideal process generated with Blender, an open source free physics rendering engine. Recognition of visual deviations was accomplished by analyzing the similarity of histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) of local image areas. The developed technique requires preliminary modeling of the working environment to achieve the best match for orientation, color rendering, lighting, and other parameters of the printed part. The output of the algorithm is a level of mismatch between printed and synthetic reference layers. Twelve similarity and distance measures were implemented and compared for their effectiveness at detecting 3D printing errors on six different representative failure types (local infill defects, presence of a foreign body in the layer, spaghetti problem, separation and shift of the printing part from the working surface, defects in thin walls, and layer shift) and their control error-free print images. The results show that although Kendall's tau, Jaccard, and Sorensen similarities are the most sensitive, Pearson's r, Spearman's rho, cosine, and Dice similarities produce the more distinguishable results. This open source method allows the program to notice critical errors in the early stages of their occurrence and either pause manufacturing processes for further investigation by an operator or in the future intelligent automatic error correction. The implementation of this novel method does not require preliminary data for training, and the greatest efficiency can be achieved with the mass production of parts by either additive or subtractive manufacturing of the same geometric shape. This open-source method has the potential means of enabling smart distributed recycling for additive manufacturing in challenging environments.

AB Polylactide (PLA) filaments for fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing with high content of milled carbon fibers (MCF, average length of 1000 nm) are produced. The selected MCF are obtained from commercial sources that derives them from pyrolysis of carbon fibers composites. Twin-screw extruder equipped with volumetric and side feeders are used to melt mix different content of MCF (i.e., from 10 to 30 wt%) prior to filament extrusion. The produced reinforced filaments are used for 3D printing specimens that are characterized in terms of their thermomechanical properties. Higher mechanical properties compared to commercial reinforced filaments are obtained with the filament modified with 30 wt% of MCF.

AB Despite extensive regulations, the systemic under-reporting of construction and demolition waste generation rates pervades the South African waste sector due to the extensive and active informal waste management practices that are typical of developing countries. This study merges the rapid development of high-technology 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) with the increasing pressure that the built environment is placing on both natural resource consumption and landfill space due to construction and demolition waste (CDW) by establishing an inventory of CDW that is suitable for use in 3DPC in South Africa. This is an essential step in ensuring the technical, economic, and logistical viability of using CDW as aggregate or supplementary cementitious materials in 3DPC. Of the methods considered, the lifetime material analysis and per capita multiplier methods are the most appropriate for the context and available seed data; this results in CDW estimates of 24.3 Mt and 12.2 Mt per annum in South Africa, respectively. This range is due to the different points of estimation for the two methods considered, and the per capita multiplier method provides an inevitable underestimation. In order to contextualise the estimated availability of CDW material for use in concrete in general, the demand for coarse and fine aggregate and supplementary cementitious material in South Africa is quantified as 77.9 Mt. This overall annual demand far exceeds the estimated CDW material (12.2-24.3 Mt) available as an alternative material source for concrete.

DE Fused deposition modelling; polylactic acid; 3D printing parameters; UV
   light; building orientation; water absorption
AB In additive manufacturing, fused deposition modelling (FDM) is one of the most often-used technologies. Polylactic Acid (PLA) is the most frequently applied polymer for prototyping or for real uses. This study mainly focuses on the mechanical properties of PLA parts printed with filament exposed to UV light to mimic the effect of recycled filament. Three radiation periods were studied, respectively, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Tensile tests were carried out to characterize the influence of building orientation (On flat/on-edge) and raster angles (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, 0 degrees/90 degrees, -45 degrees/+45 degrees). Failure modes were also discussed. Printed specimens were subjected to water absorption to assess the mechanical properties in real application. Generally with the same raster angle, the interlayer structure of specimens manufactured in on-edge orientation has greater adhesion than the specimens in flat orientation. The results show that mechanical properties are lower in case of flat building orientation and the raster angle has the same trend in both orientations. Elsewhere, edge orientation exhibited lower water absorption thanks to the inwall that protected the printed part. UV radiation enhances the interface between printed layers for the lower period. The mechanical properties were affected by the degradation of the bulk material in the direction of 90 degrees.

AB Printed circuits and electronics are widely implemented in a variety of emerging areas including solar power panel, wearable devices, screen display, etc. Recently, gallium-based alloys become promising candidates in applications ranging from flexible electronics to efficient cooling due to its high conductivity, fluidity, and nontoxicity. However, the implementation of liquid metal printing is highly restricted to its adhesion with different substrates. The adhesiveness can be enhanced by promoting the oxidation such as intensive stirring, whereas the fluidity would be severely confined. Aiming to tackle the existing challenges, here the authors propose a facile liquid metal printed electronics method through spraying a customized superhydrophobic film upon the substrate and then forming desired patterns via selective adhesion of liquid metal. The required customization can be realized via removable mask or surface energy variation. The presented strategy demonstrates excellent substrate adaptability including glass, plastic, paper, carbon fiber composite, ceramic, etc. Besides, complex 3D circuits can be created upon curved surfaces of diversified geometries. Sprayed liquid metal can be easily recycled, which is beneficial to an environmental and sustainable production. This work suggests a potential direction for liquid metal circuit fabrication and may enlighten other studies to resolve liquid metal contamination, flow friction, etc.

AB The integration of waste materials in extrudable cement mixtures has the potential to make the construction industry more sustainable by reducing carbon footprints and developing eco-friendly materials. This along with advancements in 3D concrete printing (3DCP) provides engineering and architectural benefits by reducing material waste and costs. In this paper, the impact of waste incorporation on properties of mortar and concrete is examined. The use of waste materials, such as pumice, coal slag, agricultural lignocellulosic residues, and recycled rubber tyres, to improve thermal insulation and durability of cementitious composites is discussed. In addition, the incorporation of air-entraining admixtures with surfactant activity is explored for their indirect effect on thermal behaviour, pore size reduction, and enhancement in concrete properties. This review includes important topics such as a strength resistance to freezing and thawing, fire resistance, plasticising effect, and delay in cement hydration. These findings highlight the benefits of using diverse waste materials in construction, providing a multidimensional approach to waste management, cost optimization, and enhanced construction materials in the context of 3DCP.

AB Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) offer a potential solution to the weak tensile strength and cracking issues of 3D printed concrete (3DPC), while their great performance under dynamic loading helps to broaden the application scope of 3D printing technology. This study systematically investigates the relationship between the dynamic compressive properties and the anisotropic behavior of 3DP-ECC under various strain rates through ultrasonic pulse velocity, quasi-static and dynamic compression, as well as novel sieving tests. The results indicate that the dynamic compressive behavior of 3DP-ECC shows a pronounced strain rate dependency especially in the Z-direction, while the mechanical anisotropy coefficient of the 3DP specimens decreased by 14.2% as the strain rate rose from 60 s_ 1 to 120 s_ 1. In what follows, the fractal theory is applied to characterize the internal damage of 3DP-ECC in different orientations, indicating that the dynamic compressive strength and dissipation energy exhibit a linear relationship with the fractal dimension. Based on the modified viscoelastic theory and spatial transformation tensor method, the anisotropic damage dynamic compression constitutive model is developed to predict the stress-strain behavior of 3DP-ECC at different strain rates. The exploration of dynamic compression behavior and anisotropic constitutive relationships of 3DP-ECC provides a basis for further integrated practical applications under extreme strain rate conditions.

AB The leather industry produces a substantial amount of solid waste, which is frequently disposed of via incineration or landfilling. While hydrolysis offers a valuable and sustainable method to chemically recycle leather waste, both acidic and alkaline processes present challenges due to the salts produced during neutralization. This study aims to upcycle leather scraps through hydrolysis, producing a powdered filler for versatile composites suitable for both LCD vat photopolymerization and Direct Ink Writing 3D printing technologies. A zero-waste hydrolysis process was adopted using sulfuric acid neutralized with calcium hydroxide, achieving a yield of 91.3%. The composites featured a matrix composed of polyethylene-glycol-diacrylate and glycerol dimethacrylate, with embedded leather hydrolysate powder at concentrations up to 20% w/wmatrix. Tensile tests conducted on neat resin and composites demonstrated the strengthening effect of leather hydrolysate filler. Additionally, rheological tests displayed a viscoelastic behavior suitable for the adopted 3D printing technologies. The composites were successfully 3D-printed using both Direct Ink Writing and vat photopolymerization techniques, showing promising printing accuracy. This work demonstrates the potential of valorizing leather waste, upcycled via a hydrolysis method, to produce composites suitable for additive manufacturing to advance the sustainability and the circularity of the fashion sector.

AB The linear lifecycle of the textile industry contributes to the enormous waste generation of post-consumer garments. Recycling or repurposing of post-consumer garments typically requires separation of the individual components. This study describes a novel and facile chemo-thermo-mechanical method for producing extrudable pellets, involving one-pot, 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl (TEMPO)-mediated oxidation of post-consumer polycotton textiles, followed by mild mechanical treatment, all without isolating the constituents of the polycotton blend. The oxidized blend with high cellulose and carboxylate content of 1221 +/- 82 mmol COO- per kg of cotton, is pelletised into a masterbatch and further in situ extruded into nanocomposite filaments for 3D printing. The carboxyl groups introduced on the polycotton-based filters enable cotton fibrillation into nanoscaled fibers during mechanical treatment and extrusion resulting to a variety of functional and high surface-finish quality models, including filters and fashion accessories. The electrostatic interactions with positively charged species, such as methylene blue (MB), facilitate their adsorption from water while exhibiting promising adsorption capacities. The adsorption of MB follows the Freundlich model and depends on the printed porosity of the filter. A "trash to treasure" concept for textile waste is further corroborated through the use of the developed 3D printing filament into commodity products.
   Driven by the global repercussions of textile waste accumulation, this study proposes a novel, one-pot route to upcycle blended cotton and polyethylene-terephthalate post-consumer textiles, without separating the individual components of the blend. Following a combination of a water-based chemical and mechanical treatment, the textiles are extruded into 3D printing filaments with high-cellulose and processed into a variety of functional products. image

AB 3D printing concrete (3DPC) technology plays an increasingly important role in intelligent construction, requiring improved performance and reduced environmental impact. In this study, waste glass powder (WGP) was used as a sustainable supplementary cementitious material (SCM) to partially replace ordinary Portland cement (OPC) or silica fume (SF) in 3DPC. The effects of WGP on printability, mechanical properties, hydration behavior, and pore structure were evaluated. Results showed that replacing OPC with WGP initially enhanced extrudability due to reduced friction, but excessive replacement led to reduced buildability caused by the angular shape of WGP particles. While early-age hydration was delayed, later hydration was accelerated by the filler and nucleation effects. The optimal replacement level of 10-15 % WGP improved 28day compressive strength through pozzolanic reactions. In contrast, replacing SF with WGP had limited impact on mechanical and microstructural performance. These findings provide insights into the effective use of WGP in 3DPC for enhanced performance and sustainability.

AB 3D concrete printing (3DCP) is an innovative technique that promises to enhance the global construction industry. However, due to the absence of large aggregates in printable mixes, most of the mixes for 3DCP in the literature contain a significant component (similar to 480 kg/m3) of Portland cement, which contributes to large embodied carbon emissions. In response to the limited supply of traditional supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) (e.g., fly ash and ground granulated blast-furnace slag) in Aotearoa - New Zealand, it is necessary to explore alternative local materials. The durability properties, which are crucial for the long-term performance and sustainability of structures, remain underexplored in 3DCP. This study analyses the permeability and electrical resistivity of novel 3D concrete printing mixes developed using locally-sourced zeolite and calcined clay, and recycled mussel shell powder materials as SCMs. Printed and cast specimens were subjected to oxygen permeability, electrical resistivity, and porosity tests at 7, 28, and 90 days. Results showed that zeolite can be used in printable mixes for 3DCP, especially in binary blends with up to 40 % cement substitution. Z40 printed samples were the only specimens with an electrical resistivity greater than 1340 Omega center dot m from 28 days onwards, which indicates negligible chloride ion penetration. On the other hand, the use of local clay negatively influenced the porosity levels and electrical resistivity of samples, compared to the benchmark and the zeolitebased binders. The use of mussel shell powder, as a source of calcium carbonate, is not feasible in the proportion used in this study, and further research is required.

AB With the increasing use of the filament fabrication process, the in-house production of filament and the recycling of PLA waste is becoming more and more important. Small desktop filament extruders with associated peripherals enable small businesses and private users to carry out these recycling processes. Determing the right process parameters is of crucial importance here. These are usually only issued by the polymer manufacturer and the machine manufacturer. However, the development of own process parameters is important for new polymer compounds, as well as polymers with unknown manufacturers, as is typical in recycling. The common Taguchi method, which is used for process optimisation within the FFF process, was also used in this article to produce improved parameter sets for the production of filament using a single screw extruder (3devo Precision) with four heating zones. In this experimental field, the Taguchi method did not prove promising. Due to the small dimensions and compact design of such desktop filament extrusion machines, it was found that the setting parameters cannot be considered independently. The main parameters influencing the process were identified as the extruder screw speed, the cooling capacity and the temperature of the heating coil at the hopper. Nevertheless, parameter sets for PLA pellets and recycled PLA could be developed which have a better performance in terms of homogeneity of the diameter over time compared to the previously available parameter sets.

AB Three-dimensionally printed materials show great performance and reliable stability in the removal of refractory organic pollutants in Fenton-like reactions. In this work, hierarchically porous zero-valent copper (3DHP-ZVC) was designed and fabricated via 3D printing and applied as a catalyst for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) through heterogeneous Fenton-like processes. It was found that the 3DHP-ZVC/H2O2 system could decompose over 93.2% of TC within 60 min, which is much superior to the homogeneous Cu2+/H2O2 system under similar conditions. The leaching concentration of Cu2+ ions in the 3DHP-ZVC/H2O2 system is 2.14 times lower than that in the Cu powder/H2O2 system in a neutral environment, which could be ascribed to the unique hierarchically porous structure of 3DHP-ZVC. Furthermore, 3DHP-ZVC exhibited compelling stability in 20 consecutive cycles. The effects of co-existing inorganic anions, adaptability, and pH resistance on the degradation of TC were also investigated. A series of experiments and characterizations revealed that Cu-0 and superoxide radicals as reducing agents could facilitate the cycling of Cu(II)/Cu(I), thus enhancing the generation of hydroxyl radicals to degrade TC. This study provides new insights into employing promising 3D printing technology to develop high-reactivity, stable, and recycling-friendly components for wastewater treatment.

AB The transition toward circular economy models has been progressively promoted in the last few years. Different disciplines and strategies may significantly support this change. Although the specific contribution derived from design, material science, and additive manufacturing is well-established, their interdisciplinary relationship in circular economy contexts is relatively unexplored. This paper aims to review the main case studies related to new circular economy models for waste valorization through extrusion-based additive manufacturing, circular materials, and new design strategies. The general patterns were investigated through a comprehensive analysis of 74 case studies from academic research and design practice in the last six-year period (2015-2021), focusing on the application fields, the 3D printing technologies, and the materials. Further considerations and future trends were then included by looking at the relevant funded projects and case studies of 2021. A broader number of applications, circular materials, and technologies were explored by the academic context, concerning the practice-based scenario linked to more consolidated fields. Thanks to the development of new strategies and experiential tools, academic research and practice can be linked to foster new opportunities to implement circular economy models.

AB The rapid advancement of additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, has created unparalleled prospects for design innovation and production efficiency. Nonetheless, dependence on petroleum-derived polymers presents considerable environmental and sustainability issues. In reaction to these issues, natural fiber-reinforced filament technologies have surfaced as a promising approach for sustainable production. This review aims to objectively evaluate the progress in the development of natural fiber-reinforced filaments, emphasizing their capacity to diminish the carbon footprint of additive manufacturing while improving mechanical, thermal, and functional characteristics. This paper systematically examines manufacturing methodologies, including pelletization and extrusion processes, material behavior such as viscoelasticity and morphological characteristics, and assesses their performance in various applications within the automotive, aerospace, medical, and consumer goods sectors. Particular attention is directed on resolving enduring challenges including material inconsistency, moisture sensitivity, and recycling constraints. Moreover, the analysis delineates existing research deficiencies and suggests prospective avenues, including the incorporation of smart materials and the implementation of circular economy frameworks. This article provides a thorough assessment of difficulties and opportunities to facilitate the progress and practical implementation of sustainable natural fiber-based filaments in the next generation of additive manufacturing.

AB This study investigated the impact of 3D printing technology and the feasibility of adopting an alternative material to improve sustainability in the manufacture of a clubfoot brace. An advanced material selection process gave ABS, PLA and PETG materials as the optimum materials for the manufacture of a low-cost stiffness-limited clubfoot brace, using 3D printing technology. However, a cheaper recycled PETG (rPETG) filament material was used in place of the earlier selected PETG to additively manufacture specimens for the mechanical tests. Taguchi design of experiment was adopted in order to link these filament materials together with other 3D printing parameters such as infill percentage and layer height to identify the optimum input parameter combination for flexural, compressive and tensile strength. Test specimens were designed on Creo parametric software as per ASTM standard and 3D printed using parameter combinations designed with the Taguchi technique. Responses for the signal-to-noise ratios of the respective tests revealed that filament material is the most influential parameter, followed by infill percentage for flexural strength and layer height for compressive strength. Main effects plots of the SN ratios identified the rPETG material as the optimum for flexural strength at 13% infill percentage and 0.15 mm layer height. While PLA gave the best compressive strength at parameter combination of 13% infill percentage and 0.10 mm layer height. Results obtained from the grey relational analysis for multi-response optimization revealed that rPETG is the highest-ranking material with a grey relational grade of 0.801.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most common 3D printing materials. However, once processed, the properties of its raw material are altered. 3D printed PLA waste (3DP-PLAW) has a relatively high calorific value with low impurities, which makes waste-to-energy utilization effective through thermal conversion. In this study, the pyrolysis characteristics of 3DP-PLAW were investigated using thermogravimetric-Fourier infrared spectroscopy/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TG-FTIR/GC-MS). Two main pyrolysis stages were observed at 260-390 ? and 390-500 ? during 3DP-PLAW pyrolysis, which contradicts with findings from previous research. Upon reaching 390 degrees C, residual ash and char triggered a secondary reaction. It is speculated that the occurrence of a second pyrolysis stage is attributed to changes in the physicochemical properties of the PLA during the 3D printing process. It was also found that 3DP-PLAW had a higher heating value (HHV) (20.949 MJmiddotkg(-1)) than that of the raw PLA. The pyrolysis kinetics of 3DP-PLAW was analyzed using the distributed activation energy model (DAEM) as well as Flynn-Wall and Ozawa (FWO), Starink, and Friedman methods; it was found that the activation energies obtained from these methods were similar (approximately 206 kJmiddotmol(-1)). Therefore, these methods are suitable for biomass plastics. The TG-FTIR/GC-MS results showed that CO, CO2, CH4, CH3CHO, esters, carbon-based compounds, and ethene were the main gaseous products of 3DP-PLAW pyrolysis. In contrast to a previous study on raw PLA, no ketone was detected in the gaseous products during 3DP-PLAW. These findings allow for the production of energy products, instead of the usage of natural gas for recycling, which underlines the potential value of 3DP-PLAW for energy recovery and subsequent improvements on the current 3DP-PLAW disposal methods.

AB The requirements for pumpability, extrudability, and buildability of 3D printable concrete are very high, and it is hard for ready-mix concrete to meet these requirements. In this study, a novel method, namely secondary mixing was performed to adjust the ready-mix concrete with high fluidity to a printable state by adding an appropriate amount of viscosity modifying agent before printing. The effects of hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) and standing time on the rheology evolution of 3D printable ready-mix concrete (3DPRC) before/after secondary mixing were comparatively investigated. In addition, recycled coarse aggregates (RCA) with a maximum size of 10 mm were applied to prepare 3DPRC. The results showed that adding HPMC during secondary mixing on-site facilitated the buildability of 3DPRC by increasing its static yield stress. The standing time exhibited a great effect on the improvement of dynamic yield stress. Meanwhile, the RCA increased the dynamic yield stress during the standing period and the plastic viscosity during secondary mixing. These effects can contribute to the printability of ready-mix concrete.

AB Recently, because of the complex international situation and combat environment in the future, the development and application of new concept weapons have raised higher performance requirements for manufacturing technologies. However, at present, most weapons are still prepared using traditional charging methods (cast curing, pressure casting, and melt casting), which require subtractive manufacturing (SM) treatments before use. At present, the demand for weapon products is shifting towards reactive micro structures, high preparation efficiency, miniaturization, and controllable energy release. Besides, the modern "energetic-on-a-chip" trend was expected to reduce size and cost while increasing safety and maintaining performance. In this case, the traditional charging methods were not preferred due to their inherent drawbacks, such as being limited to the model, requiring long solvent drying times and recycling required and pores/cracks caused by the shrinkage of slurry, and so on. Therefore, it is necessary to innovate the processing and manufacturing technology of weapons and address the boundaries of existing charging methods, and this will enable the precise customization of high-quality energetic materials and avoid many defects. Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing technology, has been booming recently. The application of additive manufacturing technology in the field of energetic materials (EMs) can promote the innovation of manufacturing technology for EMs and regulate the microstructure. Additionally, 3D printing technology can break through the existing design and development mode, expand explosive charging technology, and enable the distribution of different types of explosives and explosive density in a specific space area. Besides, 3D printing can fabricate "reactive microstructures" (RMS), which offer a deeper understanding of the EMs' combustion and detonation phenomena at the micro- and nanoscale. Thus, the explosive/propellant grains with multiple damage modes can be designed and manufactured. This paper aims to summarize the current progress in the 3D printing of EMs, analyze the corresponding mechanisms, and provide guidance for future research.

AB Three-dimensional Cementitious materials Printing (3DCP) is a cutting-edge technology for the construction industry. Three-dimensional printed buildings have shown that a well-developed automated technology can foster valuable benefits, such as a freeform architectural design without formworks and reduced human intervention. However, scalability, commercialization and sustainability of the 3DPC technology remain critical issues. The current work presents the ecological fragility, challenges and opportunities inherent in decreasing the 3DCP environmental footprint at a material level (cementitious materials and aggregates). The very demanding performance of printable mixtures, namely in a fresh state, requires high dosages of cement and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM). Besides the heavy carbon footprint of cement production, the standard SCM availability might be an issue, especially in the longer term. One exciting option to decrease the embodied CO2 of 3DCP is, for example, to incorporate alternative and locally available SCM as partial cement replacements. Those alternative SCM can be wastes or by-products from industries or agriculture, with no added value. Moreover, the partial replacement of natural aggregate can also bring advantages for natural resource preservation. This work has highlighted the enormous potential of 3DCP to contribute to reducing the dependence on Portland cement and to manage the current colossal wastes and by-products with no added value, shifting to a Circular Economy. Though LCA analysis, mixture design revealed a critical parameter in the environmental impact of 3DCP elements or buildings. Even though cement significantly affects the LCA of 3DCP, it is crucial to achieving adequate fresh properties and rheology. From the literature survey, mixtures formulated with alternative SCM (wastes or by-products) are still restricted to rice husk ash, Municipal Solid Waste ashes and recycled powder from construction and demolition wastes. Natural aggregate replacement research has been focused on recycled fine sand, mine tailing, copper tailing, iron tailing, ornamental stone waste, recycled glass, crumb rubber, rubber powder and granules, recycled PET bottles and steel slag. However, flowability loss and mechanical strength decrease are still critical. Research efforts are needed to find low-carbon cement replacements and mix-design optimization, leading to a more sustainable and circular 3DCP while ensuring the final product performance.

AB Towards a sustainable future and aiming to reduce pressure on natural resources, circular economy and recycling play a crucial role. Therefore, it is essential to develop methods for recycling non-recyclable materials with remarkable physio-mechanical properties. One category of such materials is automotive tire waste, composed of synthetic and natural rubber, chemical additives, fabrics, etc. Automotive end-of-life tires are discarded in large numbers (over 1 billion) annually and consist of non-recyclable materials with significant environmental hazards. In this context, the current study aims to present a sustainable method for utilizing automotive tire waste by employing robust recycling systems and additive manufacturing technologies. Automotive end-of-life tires were shredded into a powder form and mixed with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) pellets to create distinct mixtures with various compositions. These mixtures were processed through a robust recycling system to develop printable filaments made of composite materials with a polymeric matrix and tire particles as reinforcement. The produced filaments, as secondary life products, were used for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) of tensile and compression 3D printed specimens. These specimens were designed and tested under quasi-static tensile and compression loading, according to ISO 527 and 604, in order to be evaluated in terms of structural integrity and repeatability. The results of this study indicate a sustainable process for utilizing automotive tire waste via additive manufacturing with the ultimate objective of reusing and remanufacturing in a more circular way valorizing the tire industry and reducing the impacts of human economic activities on the environment.

AB The interest in space exploration by the private sector has been growing rapidly in recent years, along with business models to profit from long-duration space activities. Additive manufacturing in-space (ISM) plays an essential role in long-term space exploration mission sustainability based on on-demand production and recycling of materials. One important issue for electronics in space is their interaction of charged particles which affects the materials' mechanical properties when exposed to the radiation environment of space. This paper reports the effectiveness of radiation shielding 3D-printed ABS and carbon fiber filled nylon composite for short-time exposure. Since carbon fiber filled nylon composite has better shielding effectiveness, a two-layer coupled-fed 3D-printed microstrip antenna is presented for antenna-on-package applications, where the antenna can be used as a radiation shielding element. The fabricated antenna resonates at 5.88 GHz, exhibiting a 10 dB return-loss bandwidth of 5.5 %. A low-cost radiation shielding effectiveness measurement technique is presented, along with the results for ABS and carbon fiber filled nylon composite.

AB Polyelectrolyte complexes (PECs), assemblies of oppositely charged polymers with powerful properties and wide-ranging applications, are currently not melt-processable via any conventional means and have been limited commercially to applications only as coatings. Here, a unique strategy of pairing a polycation with an oppositely charged photopolymerizable monomer is employed. Vat photopolymerization of this mixture yields 3D spatial control over PECs for the first time. The properties of these 3D-printed PECs are evaluated and are found to be similar to conventionally studied PEC materials. The water sensitivity of the PEC parts is adjustable through the incorporation of a small amount of a hydrophilic covalent crosslinker, highlighting potential future applications of these materials in 4D printing. Finally, the upcyclability of the additively manufactured PECs is demonstrated through the dissolution of a printed part and its incorporation into virgin resin to yield a part composed of partially recycled material. This chemistry has the potential to dramatically expand the application space of PEC materials and is a step towards a more circular economy for the field of additive manufacturing.

AB Polymer composites with different reinforcements have many applications. By adjusting process settings and adding fibers and fillers, composite properties can be improved. Additive manufacturing is popular in the polymer industry because it can manufacture intricately designed parts with fewer defects and greater strength with less material consumption. Composites use thermoplastics and thermosetting polymers. Thermoset plastics cannot be reused or recycled; therefore, they are disposed in landfills, creating pollution and environmental harm. In this work, thermoplastic ASA (Acrylonitrile Styrene Acrylate) polymer filament is used for FDM 3D printing. The specimens are made by varying five process parameters that affected the materials' mechanical properties. The tensile, flexural and impact specimens are made using MINITAB software and ASTM requirements. The L18 orthogonal array experimental design, specimens and results were optimized. Infill density and layer height were most influential. Maximum tensile strength of 51.86 MPa, flexural strength of 82.56 MPa and impact strength of 0.180 J/mm(2) were obtained by following the software-suggested input factors and compared with the predicted values. Final error percentage was obtained between the predicted and the experimental results and it was found to be under 3%, which is acceptable.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has emerged as the preferred method for creating three-dimensional (3D) models with minimal waste. To enhance the mechanical strength of the 3D-printed models using FDM, researchers have explored composite filaments. This study aims to advance electronic waste (EW) recycling for effective waste management by fabricating a composite filament by incorporating EW as a filler particle for FDM application. The composite filament merges polylactic acid with printed circuit board (PCB) particles sourced from EW. Physical properties like flexural and compression strength were evaluated. The samples were printed following ASTM D790 and ASTM D695 standards, using default parameters such as a 100 % infill rate, rectilinear pattern, and a layer thickness of 0.2 mm. The optimal printing temperature of 200 degrees C for the samples was determined through flowability testing. Subsequently, the dimensional stability and surface roughness of the printed samples were assessed, demonstrating that the inclusion of filler particles enhanced dimensional stability and decreased surface roughness. The results of this study show that a composite filament containing 3 wt% EW-PCB exhibits enhanced flexural strength and a notable increase in flexural modulus. Similarly, the filament containing 3 wt% EW-PCB exhibited a 35 % increase in bulk modulus compared to the filament without EW, attributed to the presence of metals in the PCBs. The micromorphological analysis was performed on the tested samples using field emission scanning electron microscopy.

AB Solid composites used in material extrusion additive manufacturing have experienced considerable expansion over the past 5 years, incorporating functional properties into 3D-printed objects. This paper presents a systematic review that aims to: (I) analyze the current state of development in the field; (II) quantify and categorize the adopted polymeric matrices, reinforcing materials, feedstock shapes, characterization strategies, and extrusion mechanisms; and (III) identify the applications, limitations, and trends for future research. The PRISMA statement was followed and the databases Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were consulted. Among the 116 included studies, the use of customized filaments surpassed the commercially available ones, with particulate matter being the most common form of filler when melt-mixed with the polymer. Polyamide is the most widely adopted matrix (30.3%), followed by PLA (22.0%) and ABS (17.4%). In terms of reinforcements, carbon fiber (32.4%), glass fiber (12.5%), and ceramics (12.5%) compose the podium as the most frequently used, with nanofillers receiving increasing attention. In the conducted analysis, no standardized protocols were identified that clearly encompassed the entire process from feedstock formulation to technical prototype fabrication. At last, recycling, exploration of biodegradable materials, and 4D printing were identified as the main opportunities for future research.Highlights Reinforced polymers enable the enhancement of properties for 3D-printed parts. Composite feedstock is usually formulated and mixed before printing. 3D printers with filament- or screw-based extrusion mechanisms have been used. Mechanical and morphological analyses are common in material characterization. No identified applications were employed in real-world scenarios.

AB There is no doubt that additive manufacturing (AM) with mortars presents an opportunity within the framework of a circular economy that should not be overlooked. The concepts of reduce, reuse, and recycle are fully aligned with this technology. One of the less explored possibilities is the utilisation of mining tailings as aggregates in printing mortars. This idea not only incorporates the concept of recycling but also contributes to a reduction in the production of potentially hazardous waste that would otherwise require storage in dams, thereby decreasing long-term environmental risks and improving the management of mineral resources. We employed a mortar composed of 12.5% material derived from mining tailings to highlight aspects of AM that are typically not subject to analysis, such as the necessity of considering contact interfaces between layers in structural design, the stackability of layers during the construction process, and the behaviour under fire and seismic events, which must be taken into account during the operational phase. Without aiming for exhaustiveness, we conducted a series of tests and computational modelling to show the significance of these factors, with the intention of drawing the attention of different stakeholders-including construction companies, regulatory authorities, standardisation agencies, insurers, and end-users.

AB This study investigated the incorporation of desized short recycled carbon fiber (rCF) into polylactic acid (PLA) matrix for fused deposition modeling (FDM) printing. Composite filaments were produced by ball milling mixing and then melt extrusion, unlike the majority of the existing studies, which employed multi-cycle compounding/ extrusion. Composite filaments with different loadings of rCF were produced. Tensile testing was carried out to evaluate the influence of rCF on mechanical properties. The morphology of the extruded filaments, as-printed, and fractured samples was assessed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal properties of the produced filaments were also evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The SEM images demonstrated a homogeneous distribution of the rCF within the PLA matrix, with good adhesion between PLA and desized rCF. DSC showed lesser thermal alteration in the pure PLA filaments compared to PLA pellets due to the currently used mixing methodology. TGA results showed enhanced thermal stability with adding rCF into PLA. Incorporation of rCF increased tensile modulus up to 58.30 % compared to pure PLA. The tensile modulus of the PLA/15 %rCF composite was higher than that of the commercially available PLA/15 %vCF composite (19.64 % enhancement) while showing similar strength. In fractured specimens, the intra-layer failure mechanism was dominated, while no significant interlayer separation was observed. The study demonstrates the potential of employing eco-friendly desized rCF as a substitute for vCF in producing fiber-reinforced PLA for FDM printing.

AB In the present study investigations were made on the effect of multi-stage recycling/ recycling cycles and recycled material strength for five different polylactic acid (PLA) composite matrixes (a) PLA (100 wt%) (b) PLA/wood powder (95/5 wt% ratio) (c) PLA/polyvinyl chloride (PVC) (75/25 wt% ratio) (d) PLA/Fe3O4 (80/20 wt% ratio) and (e) PLA/PVC/Fe3O4/wood powder (50/25/20/5 wt % ratio). The study suggests that most of the composite matrix of PLA tested (during secondary recycling) lose 50-60% of their peak strength for the third cycle of recycling except for the PLA/Fe3O4 and PLA (primary recycling) which has shown 22% and 36% loss in mechanical strength respectively. Results of the study suggest that PLA composite retains 85-90% of mechanical strength (except PLA/PVC composite) for first recycling, 65-75% of their strength up to the second stage of recycling, and 50% of mechanical strength for the third stage of recycling. The study also suggests that there were positive effects of recycling on mechanical properties as the modulus of toughness was improved for most of the PLA composite matrices with increasing recycling stages except for the PLA/PVC composite matrix.

AB Additive Manufacturing, referred to as 3D printing has extended beyond simple prototyping and is being used for the fabrication of fully functional active components. It is one of the flexible manufacturing technique that can apply to polymers, metals, ceramics, concrete, and composites. Owing to the ability to select from a wide range of processible polymers and the enhancement in some of the properties offered by polymers, the AM industry, still predominantly targets the production of polymeric components. This review demonstrates the current state of AM industry regarding polymeric materials. A brief explanation of the additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, polymers, and polymer composites (fibre reinforces, particle reinforced and nanocomposites) utilised in the AM processes is provided. Polymer AM is being applied in different applications such as biomedical, electronics, aerospace, automobile, and sporting industries respectively. The review also emphasizes the rising importance of antimicrobial polymers in the COVID-19 pandemic. The exponential use of polymeric materials in the industrial sector has caused an increase in wastage generation and disposal issues which draws attention to the importance of green composites as well as life cycle assessment (LCA) of products and processes. Finally, the significance of Distributed Recycling via AM due to the disposal issues and low polymer recycling rates is illustrated.

AB This present work demonstrated the functional transformation of 3D printed metal substrates into a new family of Surface-enhanced Raman Scattering substrates, a promising approach in developing SERS-based Point-of-care (PoC) analytical platforms. L-Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF, Additive manufacturing or 3D printing technique) printed metal substrates have rough surfaces, and exhibit high thermal stability and intrinsic chemical inertness, necessitating a suitable surface functionalization approach. This present work demonstrated a unique multi-stage approach to transform L-PBF printed metal structures as recyclable SERS substrates by colloidal carbon templating, chemical vapor deposition, and electroless plating methods sequentially. The surface of the printed metal structures was functionalized using the colloidal carbon soot particles, that were formed by the eucalyptus oil flame deposition method. These carbon particles were shown to interact with the metals present in the printed structures by forming metal carbides and function as an adlayer on the surface. Subsequent deposition of TiO2 onto these templates led to strong grafting of TiO2 and retaining the fractal structure of the soot template onto the metal surface. Electroless deposition of silver nanoparticles resulted in the formation of fractally structured TiO2/Ag nanostructures and these functionalized printed metal structures were shown as excellent SERS substrates in enhancing the vibrational spectral features of Rhodamine B (RhB). The presence of TiO2 photocatalyst on the surface was shown to remove the RhB analyte from the surface under photochemical conditions, which enables the regeneration of SERS activity, and the substrate can be recycled. The migration of metals from the printed metal structures into the fractally ordered TiO2/Ag nanostructures was found to enhance the photocatalytic activity and increase the recyclability of these substrates. This study demonstrates the potential of 3D-printed Inconel metal substrates as next-generation recyclable SERS platforms, offering a substantial advancement over traditional colloidal, thin-film, flexible, and hard SERS substrates.

AB Objective: To assess the mechanical and adhesive properties of additively manufactured (AM) materials with variable sustainability and recyclability as alternatives to traditional light-cured acrylic resin for dental custom trays. Materials and method: Four different AM materials; a photopolymer resin tray material printed with DLP and three FDM printed polylactic acid (PLA), recycled PLA and Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG) and a conventional light-cure acrylic resin (LC PMMA) as a control were used to construct dumbbell (tensile testing), rectangular (flexural testing) to verify suitability for custom trays (n=10/group). To evaluate bond strength, specimens were manufactured at 0, 45 and 90 degrees printing orientation (n=10/group). Surface roughness was evaluated with confocal scanning microscopy. The three mechanical tests were completed in a universal testing machine (Instron) according to ISO 527-2 and ISO 20795-1. Results were statistically analysed with PRISM (Version 10) Software using one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Confocal analysis and SEM analysis were conducted for quantitative and qualitative surface analysis. Results: For tensile and flexural strength, PLA (Recycled) and PETG showed no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) from LC PMMA. AM materials yielded a higher bond strength than the LC PMMA material. Print orientation was found to affect the bond strength of some materials with varying surface roughness as contributing factors. Conclusion: LC PMMA, PLA (Recycled), and PETG have the greatest flexural and tensile strengths. PLA (Recycled) and PETG were the highest performing AM options with regard to flexural and tensile strength for custom trays. All AM materials showed a significantly higher bond strength compared to LC PMMA. To maximise the bond strength, PLA (Recycled) should be printed at an angle of 0 degrees, and PETG at 0 or 90 degrees. Dental practitioners should consider the varying degrees of recyclability of materials, in addition to their mechanical properties.

AB Materials obtained from renewable sources are emerging to replace the starting materials of petroleum-derived plastics. They offer easy processing, fulfill technological, functional and durability requirements at the same time ensuring increased bio-compatibility, recycling, and eventually lower cost. On the other hand, optical 3D printing (O3DP) is a rapid prototyping tool (and an additive manufacturing technique) being developed as a choice for efficient and low waste production method, yet currently associated with mainly petroleum-derived resins. Here we employ a single bio-based resin derived from soy beans, suitable for O3DP in the scales from nano- to macro-dimensions, which can be processed even without the addition of photoinitiator. The approach is validated using both state-of-the art laser nanolithography setup as well as a widespread table-top 3D printer - sub-micrometer accuracy 3D objects are fabricated reproducibly. Additionally, chess-like figures are made in an industrial line commercially delivering small batch production services. Such concept is believed to make a breakthrough in rapid prototyping by switching the focus of O3DP to bio-based resins instead of being restricted to conventional petroleum-derived photopolymers.

AB The alterations in volatile organic compound (VOC) and ultrafine particulate (UFP) matter emission profiles following thermal reprocessing of multiple materials were examined. Additionally, mechanical performance of the materials was studied. The VOCs were identified by collecting air samples with Tenax (R) TA tubes and analyzing them with a GC-MS system. UFP concentrations were monitored with a portable ultrafine particle counter. Total VOC emissions of all materials were reduced by 28-68% after 5 thermal cycles (TCs). However, slight accumulation of 1,4-dioxane was observed with poly(lactic acid) materials. UFP emissions were reduced by 45-88% for 3D printing grade materials over 5 TCs but increased by 62% in the case of a waste plastic material over 3 TCs. The mechanical performance of the materials was investigated by measuring their tensile strengths (TSs) and elastic moduli (EM) with an axial-torsion testing system. The reprocessed materials expressed fluctuations in their 3D printing qualities and mechanical performances. The mechanical performances were observed to reduce only slightly after 5 TCs, and the trend was observable only after the data was mass-normalized. The TSs of the samples were reduced by 10-24%, while the EM were reduced by 1-9% after 5 TCs. The TS and EM of one material were increased by 14 and 33%, respectively. In conclusion, recycled polymers are plausible 3D printing feedstock alternatives as they possess acceptable mechanical performance and low emittance according to this study. Furthermore, non-3D printing grade polymers may be applied in a 3D printer with caution.

ID ACTIVATION
AB Disposing of wet solid waste sludge has become a prominent issue because it has high environmental risks. Herein, a clay/biochar-based monolith (CBM) is prepared using a three-dimensional (3D) printing design method. The CBM is loaded with iron (Fe) and used as a catalyst (Fe/CBM) to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for degrading levofloxacin (LVF) in an aqueous solution. The monolith preparation process is inexpensive, and the monolith has designable flow paths that facilitate improved mass transport and material recycling. ZnCl2, as a chemical activator, is added to the 3D-printed slurry to improve the catalytic performance of Fe/CBM. Oscillatory stress sweep and frequency sweep tests prove that incorporating ZnCl2-containing sludge in the slurry effectively increases the elastic modulus and critical stress, improving structural stability and constructability. The slurry containing 10% sludge (S-10%-Zn with 1 M ZnCl2), exhibits 30% higher static yield stress than the slurry containing only clay and water (S-0%). Fe/CBM is prepared by loading Fe active sites onto the surface of CBM via an impregnation method, and it leaches very low amounts of Fe (<0.2 mg/L) and other heavy metals (e.g., Cd, and Pd, etc). Fe/CBM-S-10%-Zn/PMS with 10% mass fraction of sludge exhibits much higher (similar to 80% at 20 min) degradation efficiency than Fe/CBM-S-0%/PMS (similar to 15% at 20 min) and Fe/CBM-S-10%/PMS (similar to 43% at 20 min). Combining with XPS results, when ZnCl2 is added to the slurry, the content of Fe2+ in the catalytic material increases, improving the catalytic performance. The PMS activation mechanism of Fe/CBM-S-10%-Zn for LVF degradation is also discussed, which is ascribed to the radical and nonradical pathways. This provides new insights on how to recycle solid waste and make high-performance clay/biochar-based monolith catalysts for the continuous wastewater treatment.

AB This paper reports the development of the first vitrimer based on polybenzoxazines containing disulfide bonds and cardanol. The synthesis of the monomer was carried out following a sustainable process, without any solvent and purification. The novel polybenzoxazine can be recycled, reshaped and (re)processed, thanks to a fast relaxation process (18 seconds at 120 degrees C) and low activation energy (64.5 kJ mol(-1)). Furthermore, the benzoxazine vitrimer shows significant and healable adhesive properties over short times and at low temperatures. These features support it also being considered in additive manufacturing applications, with the possibility of applying 3D printing technology, extending its application to many fields of materials.

AB Recently, Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), one of the most encouraging additive manufacturing (AM) techniques, has fascinated great attention. Although FFF is growing into a manufacturing device with considerable technological and material innovations, there still is a challenge to convert FFF-printed prototypes into functional objects for industrial applications. Polymer components manufactured by FFF process possess, in fact, low and anisotropic mechanical properties, compared to the same parts, obtained by using traditional building methods. The poor mechanical properties of the FFF-printed objects could be attributed to the weak interlayer bond interface that develops during the layer deposition process and to the commercial thermoplastic materials used. In order to increase the final properties of the 3D printed models, several polymer-based composites and nanocomposites have been proposed for FFF process. However, even if the mechanical properties greatly increase, these materials are not all biodegradable. Consequently, their waste disposal represents an important issue that needs an urgent solution. Several scientific researchers have therefore moved towards the development of natural or recyclable materials for FFF techniques. This review details current progress on innovative green materials for FFF, referring to all kinds of possible industrial applications, and in particular to the field of Cultural Heritage.

AB This study delves into selective laser melting (SLM). By using M300 steel in virgin and recycled powder form (after 20 cycles), with the aim of reducing the cost of printing for the practical application of M300 maraging steel, a comprehensive comparison between the two types of powder was evaluated. The powder's morphology was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and backscattered electrons (BSE). The particles were seen to have a spherical shape, with a notable number of satellites attached to their surfaces. The particle size distribution (PSD) was examined and ranged from 10 to 90 mu m for both powders. In addition, the porosity exhibited an average value of 0.07% for the virgin powder and 0.10% for the recycled powder. The microstructure was examined. Additionally, the surface wettability was tested, and it was seen to display wetting behavior for both types of powder, while blackened surfaces showed a higher wetting angle than untreated surfaces (hydrophobic). The 2D roughness measurements showed that the recycled powder had no significant difference from the virgin powder (Ra = 5.33 mu m, Rz = 24.17 mu m) before blackening and (Ra = 5.48 mu m, Rz = 24.07 mu m) after blackening. Corrosion tests proved that the recycled powder did not affect the corrosion properties of the material, while blackening caused partial surface corrosion in both types of samples, regardless of the used powder.

However, traditional fabrication methods of 3D scaffolds and cell-laden hydrogels still face many difficulties and challenges. This study uses a newer 3D fabrication technique and the concept of recycling of an unutilized resource to fabricate a novel scaffold for bone tissue engineering. In this study, fish-extracted gelatin was incorporated with bioactive ceramic for bone tissue engineering, and with this we successfully fabricated a novel fish gelatin methacrylate (FG) polymer hydrogel mixed with strontium-doped calcium silicate powder (FGSr) 3D scaffold via photo-crosslinking. Our results indicated that the tensile strength of FGSr was almost 2.5-fold higher as compared to FG thus making it a better candidate for future clinical applications. The in-vitro assays illustrated that the FGSr scaffolds showed good biocompatibility with human Wharton jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJMSC), as well as enhancing the osteogenesis differentiation of WJMSC. The WJMSC-laden FGSr 3D scaffolds expressed a higher degree of alkaline phosphatase activity than those on cell-laden FG 3D scaffolds and this result was further proven with the subsequent calcium deposition results. Therefore, these results showed that 3D-printed cell-laden FGSr scaffolds had enhanced mechanical property and osteogenic-related behavior that made for a more suitable candidate for future clinical applications.

AB The first report of conductive recycled polyethylene terephthalate glycol (rPETg) for additive manufacturing and electrochemical applications is reported herein. Graphene nanoplatelets (GNP), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon black (CB) were embedded within a recycled feedstock to produce a filament with lower resistance than commercially available conductive polylactic acid (PLA). In addition to electrical conductivity, the rPETg was able to hold >10 wt% more conductive filler without the use of a plasticiser, showed enhanced temperature stability, had a higher modulus, improved chemical resistance, lowered levels of solution ingress, and could be sterilised in ethanol. Using a mix of carbon materials CB/MWCNT/GNP (25/2.5/2.5 wt%) the electrochemical performance of the rPETg filament was significantly enhanced, providing a heterogenous electrochemical rate constant, k0, equating to 0.88 (+/- 0.01) x 10(-3 )cm s(-1) compared to 0.46 ((+/-)0.02) x 10(-3 )cm s(-1) for commercial conductive PLA. This work presents a paradigm shift within the use of additive manufacturing and electrochemistry, allowing the production of electrodes with enhanced electrical, chemical and mechanical properties, whilst improving the sustainability of the production through the use of recycled feedstock.

AB Natural fibres are the preferred options for garment, technical and medical textiles, nonwovens and composites. Their sustainability is a considerable advantage, though the nature of silk production and processing involves a large amount of waste. The present review explores the current issues of recycling silk waste into nonwovens for various purposes. The article proposes obtaining nonwovens from short fibres using electrospinning of fibroin solutions in volatile solvents. Longer fibres are proposed to be processed into needle-punched nonwoven materials with a selection of an effective antistatic treatment.

AB Waste epoxy materials become an enormous problem to society and the environment. The advantages of epoxy resins derive from their rigid and chemically stable networks, but these qualities also make them difficult to dispose of or recycle. Herein, we demonstrated an efficient degradation of anhydride cured epoxy resin by aminolysis in aminoethanol without using any catalysts. The epoxy resin was fully decomposed at 160 degrees C in 4 h, resulting in two distinct high purity monomers (HHPA-OH and BPA-OH). To fully realize this upcycling approach, The BPA-OH was used to synthesize a polyurethane coating with an excellent glass transition temperature (88.9 degrees C), scratch hardness (8H), gouge hardness (6H), adhesive strength (5B), and strong solvent resistance. The HHPA-OH with two hydroxyl groups was reacted with methacrylic anhydride to form a dimethacrylate monomer which was then used as a viable crosslinker for photo-curable 3D printing thermosetting polymer with tensile strength as high as 64 MPa and impact strength of 4.86 kJ/m2. This work demonstrates a feasible pathway to convert anhydride cured epoxy waste to new monomeric recyclates for superior polymer products.

AB Mill scale (MS) strengthened acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) composite filaments were fabricated as an optional low-cost and sustainable feedstock material with enhanced strength using fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology. In the present study, the effects of the FFF printing parameters on the mechanical properties of the printed ABS/1.0 vol% MS composites were evaluated. Test specimens of the composite were fabricated at printing temperatures of 240-280 degrees C, printing speeds of 10-90 mm s-1, and infill densities of 25-100%. Tensile tests and Izod impact tests were conducted for the specimens printed under different printing conditions to examine their mechanical characteristics. Afterwards, macro- and microstructural observations of the fractured specimens were carried out. The average maximum stress and modulus of the printed specimens increased when the printing temperature was raised to 270 degrees C while decreasing the printing speed, with numerous air gaps and pores found in the cross-sectional microstructures after failure at low infill density. High surface roughness of the printed composites was observed by a 3D laser scanner when printing at high temperatures and speeds due to insufficient cooling. The printed composite microstructures were examined by X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT), and showed homogeneously dense particle dispersion in the entire printed part. Representative volume element (RVE)-based modeling was carried out using real particle geometries from the mu CT. RVE simulations predicted high local stress distributions around mill scale particles and air gaps in the printed samples.

AB This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing 3D printed concrete (3DPC) by incorporating ultra-fine glass powder (UFGP), focusing on its mechanical properties and high-temperature resistance. Investigation like fresh properties, basic physical properties, residual compressive strength after exposure to 400 degrees C and 800 degrees C, hygric properties such as water vapor diffusion resistance, liquid water transport, and moisture buffering capacity were performed the observe the effect of UFGP replacement ratio on 3DPC, which demonstrates significant improvements, highlighting the potential of UFGP to elevate 3DPCs' performance. Results showed significant improvements, particularly with a 20% UFGP mix, which showed the lowest compressive strength loss (9.0% at 400 degrees C and 53.7% at 800 degrees C). Additionally, the water vapor diffusion resistance factor for the 20% UFGP mix was measured at 65.03. These results suggest that incorporating UFGP in 3DPC enhances thermal resilience and mechanical properties, offering a solution for high-temperature construction. This study contributes to sustainable construction by emphasizing the importance of mechanical resilience for structural integrity under extreme temperatures.

AB Studies have been reported on recycling high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for various applications. However, little has been reported on the secondary (2 degrees) recycling of HDPE with reinforcement of SWP by fused filament fabrication (FFF) for structural applications. This study highlights the FFF of 2 degrees recycled HDPE-SWP composites by varying infill percentage (IP), infill type (IT), and nozzle temperature (NT). The study suggested that NT is one of the most crucial factors for maximizing elastic modulus (E). The best settings for FFF are 100% IP, triangle IT, and 215 degrees C NT for maximum E. The study also suggests that higher NT improved the crash resistance of the selected composite.

DE 3D printing; eye plaque; quality assurance
AB Purpose: For the custom-built construction of eye plaques, the iodine (I-125) seeds of different source strengths are recycled in our eye plaque program. To return I-125 seeds to the correct lot, we developed a novel 3D-printed conical plaque QA holder for relative assay for eye plaques. Materials and methods: A universal 3D-printed conical plaque holder was designed to accommodate six plaque sizes and fit reproducibly in a well-type dose calibrator. A reproducibility test was used to compare the plaque placement consistency in the holder versus without the holder. Plaque assays were performed for assembled plaques both before implant and after explant. The explant reading was compared with the implant reading adjusted for decay, and the relative error was calculated. The plaque response fraction (PRF) is defined as the fraction of well chamber implant reading over the total seed strength for a plaque. The PRF was aggregated for each individual plaque to confirm the seed lot before implant. Results: The reproducibility test showed the chamber reading's relative standard deviation of 0.40% with the QA holder compared to 0.68% without it. The batch relative assay was performed for 251 plaques. The absolute value of measurement deviation between explant and decay-corrected implant readings is 0.89% +/- 0.86% (mean +/- standard deviation). The PRFs for individual plaques range from 36.49% to 49.87%, with a maximum standard deviation of 2%. Conclusions: This novel 3D-printed QA holder provides reproducible setup for assaying assembled eye plaques in a well chamber. Batch relative assay can validate the seed batch used and plaque integrity during the implant without assaying individual seeds, saving valuable physicist time and radiation exposure from seed handling.

ID ENERGY STORAGE
AB Passive design solutions are important in reducing the amount of heating and cooling energy required to maintain thermal comfort inside a building, without adding to the problem of climate change. Phase change materials (PCMs) are a thermal energy storage passive design solution, with the ability to change phase and store heat at chosen temperatures. PCMs can be added to concrete to create PCM-concrete, a composite material with sensible and latent heat storage ability. The purpose of this research is to create an accurate 2D model which can be used to determine the heat transfer through 3D printed concrete (3DPC) building facades containing PCM. Two building facade wall sections are simulated in ABAQUS and validated by thermal tests - a reference 3DPC facade section, in which 64% of the natural aggregate is replaced with recycled brick aggregate (RBA-3DPC), and a PCM-3DPC facade section, containing the same replacement level of RBA but with PCM vacuum impregnated into the RBA. With the validated model, computational simulations of the thermal performance of the PCM-3DPC facade section with varying PCM melting temperatures and different facade surface colours are tested. Subse-quently, a PCM-3DPC facade section with 100% replacement of natural aggregate with RBA, infused with PCM of two melting temperatures (such as 18 degrees C for activation in winter and 28 degrees C for activation in summer) is proposed for climates with large seasonal temperature changes. In addition, contrary to most studies, an iterative approach was used for modelling cavity convection and internal ambient temperature, and this approach is found to be necessary, so as not to over constrain the model with set facade and internal temperatures.

AB The future of space exploration missions will rely on technologies increasing their endurance and self-sufficiency, including manufacturing objects on-demand. We propose a process for handling and additively manufacturing powders that functions independently of the gravitational environment and with no restriction on feedstock powder flowability. Based on a specific sequence of boundary loads applied to the granular packing, powder is transported to the printing zone, homogenized and put under compression to increase the density of the final part. The powder deposition process is validated by simulations that show the homogeneity and density of deposition to be insensitive to gravity and cohesion forces within a discrete element method (DEM) model. We further provide an experimental proof of concept of the process by successfully 3D printing parts on-ground and on parabolic flight in weightlessness. Powders exhibiting high and low flowability are used as model feedstock material to demonstrate the versatility of the process, opening the way for additive manufacturing of recycled material.

AB We propose that current in-situ resource utilization schemes based on mining of water resources on the Moon is unnecessary and unsustainable. Life support systems are capable of recycling with high efficiency. Burning of hydrogen propellant and oxygen is akin to the burning of fossil fuels. The value of in-situ resources will be in exploiting the resources that are abundant, husbanding of resources that are not and recycling as much as possible to minimise waste. We propose that a closed loop industrial ecology must be implemented with extensive recycling loops as a sustainable approach to in-situ resource utilization on the Moon. We must build in sustainability into our forays from Earth in order not to continue to make the same mistakes as we have on Earth.

AB This study investigates the impact of recycled crumb rubber (CR) content on the mechanical strength, thermal performance, and anisotropic behaviour of 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) at elevated temperatures (100 degrees C, 300 degrees C, and 600 degrees C) to optimise material composition and print orientation for enhanced structural performance. Recycled CR from used tyres is explored as a sustainable alternative in 3DPC to address tyre waste accumulation. Using the control mix design, four mix designs containing 5 %, 10 %, 15 %, and 20 % CR aggregates, replacing groundgranulated blast-furnace slag (GGBFS) by volume, were prepared to assess the effect of CR on the mechanical performance of cementitious composites in terms of compressive and flexural testing, as well as mass loss assessments. These samples were subjected to temperatures of 100 degrees C, 300 degrees C, and 600 degrees C. Results show that CR reduces compressive strength by up to 30 % at ambient conditions compared to traditional concrete. At 600 degrees C, the compressive strength further declined by approximately 43 %-70 %, with values ranging from 13 to 25 MPa, depending on the rubber content. Flexural strength peaked at 9.73 MPa at 300 degrees C but dropped sharply to 3.99 MPa at 600 degrees C due to rubber degradation. Anisotropy influenced performance significantly, with compressive strength in Direction An up to 105.7 % higher than Direction B and flexural strength in Direction C outperforming Direction D. Mass loss at 600 degrees C ranged from 13 % to 16 %, correlating with rubber content and thermal stress (R2 = 0.9849). While rubber improved postcrack toughness at moderate heat, it compromised stiffness and strength at extreme temperatures. These findings highlight CR's potential for eco-friendly construction and, for the first time, reveal how optimising both material composition and print orientation can enhance anisotropic performance under elevated thermal stress.

AB One of the most critical pillars of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is Additive Manufacturing (AM) or 3D Printing technology. This transformative technology has garnered substantial attention due to its capacity to streamline processes, save time, and enhance product quality. Simultaneously, environmental concerns are mounting, with the growing accumulation of plastic bottle waste, offering a potential source of recycled material for 3D printing. To thoroughly harness the potential of AM and address the challenge of plastic bottle waste, a robust supply chain network is essential. Such a network not only facilitates the reintegration of plastic bottle waste and 3D printing byproducts into the value chain but also delivers significant environmental, social, and economic benefits, aligning with the tenets of sustainable development and circular economy. To tackle this complex challenge, a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) mathematical model is offered to configure a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network with a strong emphasis on circularity. Environmental considerations are integral, and the primary objective is to minimize the overall cost of the network. Three well-known metaheuristics of Simulated Annealing (SA), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are employed to treat the problem which are also efficiently adjusted by the Taguchi design technique. The efficacy of our solution methods is appraised across various problem instances. The findings reveal that the developed model, in conjunction with the fine-tuned metaheuristics, successfully optimizes the configuration of the desired circular CLSC network. In conclusion, this research represents a significant step toward the establishment of a circular supply chain that combines the strengths of 3D printing technology and the repurposing of plastic bottle waste. This innovative approach holds promise for not only reducing waste and enhancing sustainability but also fostering economic and social well-being.

AB Utilizing bio-based resources is an essential part of the sustainable development of plastics. Meanwhile, the end-of-life options of bio-based plastics must be considered to avoid contributing to the accumulation of plastic waste. To address the problem of end-of-life plastics and the trade-off between chemical closed-loop recycling and high performance, targeted selection of monomers and a method for the preparation of high-performance linear polyesters that can be rapidly closed-loop recycled without the addition of additional organic solvents under mild conditions are necessary. Herein, we report strategies for synchronously constructing chemical closed-loop polyesters and achieving high performance, by using linear furan-based poly(butylene furandicarboxylate-diethylene glycol) (PBDyF), synthesized from dimethyl 2,5-furandicarboxylate, diethylene glycol (DEG) and 1,4-butanediol (BDO). Adjusting the ratio of ethyleneoxyethylene and butylene groups can endow PBDyF with excellent tensile strength (77.8 MPa), puncture resistance properties (129.7 N mm(-1)), and barrier properties (CO2 0.0120 barrier and O-2 0.0103 barrier) for PBD80F. Processing can be performed by injection moulding, and additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Moreover, we developed a rapid chemical-solvolysis strategy under mild conditions without producing other organic waste by using DEG/BDO to obtain recycled 2,5-furandicarboxylate, DEG, and BDO from PBDyF. Utilizing the differences in the solubility and boiling point, the recycled chemicals can be separated. The repolymerized polyester (rPBD(y)F) still maintains high performance compared with PBDyF. In our approach, the high-performance chemically recyclable copolyester, exhibiting greatly potential films or 3D printing applications, provides a state-of-the-art method for solving the trade-off problem between the chemical-recycling and high performance of previous linear polyesters, further supporting sustainable closed-loop chemistry.

AB Polypropylene (PP) is widely used in commodity applications owing to its chemical stability, mechanical properties and low cost. However, almost 50% of the produced PP ends up as postconsumer waste (PCW) within a short period of usage. Being a non-biodegradable polymer, recycling PCW PP is important to mitigate plastic waste in landfills. Nonetheless, recycling or upcycling postconsumer recyclate (PCR) PP into valuable resources without deterioration in physical and mechanical properties is a challenge. This report presents an approach to upcycle PCR polypropylene (rPP) into high quality 3D printing filament that not only prints with very low warpage but with significantly high elongation at break and toughness. Incorporation of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) along with maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) in specific proportions led to a significant enhancement in mechanical properties, miscibility, crystallization behavior, and 3D printability. rPP/PBAT blends with 20 wt % PBAT and 10 wt % MAPP exhibited a 62-fold enhancement in elongation at break over rPP (from 1.88 to 118.29%) and a 72-fold increase in toughness (from 2 to 143.60 kJ/m3) with almost similar tensile strength. The final printed components had better layer adhesion and structural stability with a dramatic decrease in warpage, from 25.82% for pristine rPP to only 7.86% for rPP/PBAT blend. Isothermal crystallization studies and data analysis using the Avrami equation showed that crystallization half-time (t 1/2), which measures the duration needed for half of the total crystallinity to form, increased from 12.6 s for rPP to 66 s for the rPP/PBAT blend. This report demonstrates an approach to upcycle PCR PP, a positive step toward realizing the goals of circular economy and sustainable additive manufacturing.

AB Nanoparticles are being used in novel applications of the thermoplastics industry, including automotive parts, the sports industry and leisure and consumer goods, which can be produced nowadays through additive manufacturing. However, there is limited information on the health and safety aspects during the production of these new materials, mainly from recycled sources. This study covers the exposure assessment to nano- and micro-size particles emitted from the nanocomposites during the production of filaments for 3D printing through a compounding and extrusion pilot line using recycled (post-industrial) thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and recycled polyamide 12 (PA12), which have been also upcycled through reinforcement with iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), introducing matrix healing properties triggered by induction heating. The assessment protocol included near- and far-field measurements, considering the extruder as the primary emission source, and portable measuring devices for evaluating particulate emissions reaching the inhalable zone of the lab workers. A Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) study for the extrusion process line was defined along with a Failure Tree Analysis (FTA) process in which the process deviations, their sources and the relations between them were documented. FTA allowed the identification of events that should take place in parallel (simultaneously) or in series for the failure modes to take place and the respective corrective actions to be proposed (additional to the existing control measures).

AB Waste stone sludge generated by the extractive industry has traditionally posed significant disposal challenges. This study redefines stone sludge as a valuable raw material by incorporating it into polylactic acid (PLA) to create sustainable composite materials. Pellets and filaments composed of up to 50% by weight of limestone powder and PLA were successfully produced using melt blending in a twin-screw extruder. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses revealed a uniform distribution of stone particles within the PLA matrix and confirmed the chemical and structural compatibility of the components. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the composites retained thermal stability, while mechanical testing demonstrated significant enhancements in stiffness, with an increase in elastic modulus for composites containing 50% limestone powder. The melt flow rate (MFR) decreases with increasing filler content. The brittleness also increased, reducing impact resistance. Mechanical tests were performed on injected and 3D-printed specimens. The filament produced was successfully used in 3D printing, with a small XYZ calibration cube.

AB The field of 3D bioengineering proposes to effectively contribute to the manufacture of artificial multicellular organ/tissues and the understanding of complex cellular mechanisms. In this regard, 3D cell cultures comprise a promising bioengineering possibility for the alternative treatment of organ function loss, potentially improving patient life expectancies. Patients with end-stage disease, for example, could benefit from treatment until organ transplantation or even undergo organ function restoration. Currently, 3D bioprinters can produce tissues such as trachea cartilage or artificial skin. Most low-cost 3D bioprinters are built from fused deposition modeling 3D printer frames modified for the deposition of biologically compatible material, ranging between $13.000,00 and $300.000,00. Furthermore, the cost of consumables should also be considered as they, can range from $3,85 and $100.000,00 per gram, making biomaterials expensive, hindering bioprinting access. In this context, our report describes the first prototype of a significantly low-cost 3D bioprinter built from recycled scrap metal and off-the-shelf electronics. We demonstrate the functionalized process and methodology proof of concept and aim to test it in different biological tissue scaffolds in the future, using affordable materials and open-source methodologies, thus democratizing the state of the art of this technology.

AB Global decarbonization has increased the demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), leading to a high demand for lithium a critical raw material in the EU. Efficient lithium recovery, especially from water sources, is essential due to the growing demand need for LIB recycling. Adsorption technology is effective for this purpose, but traditional powder adsorbents present operational challenges. To overcome this, 3D printing allows for the preparation of solid monolith adsorbents with improved mechanical stability and reusability. In this work, a polyamide-lithium titanium oxide composite (PA2200-Li2TiO3) was 3D-printed using selective laser sintering technology. The composite was characterized using SEM-EDS, TEM, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, TGA and XPS. The adsorbent exhibited up to 87 % lithium adsorption efficiency at a concentration of 20 mg/L and showed high selectivity for lithium over sodium (Li/Na approximate to 37.4) and potassium (Li/K approximate to 60.5). A mechanism involving Li+ ion adsorption and transport through Li2TiO3's structural channels has been proposed, with dynamic simulations suggesting that lithium ions preferentially diffuse through these channels due to their geometric and energetic configuration. Thermodynamic studies confirmed an endothermic adsorption process with enhanced performance at higher temperatures. Regeneration tests demonstrated only a 7 % reduction in adsorption efficiency after three cycles, indicating structural stability and the potential for scalable application in lithium recovery processes.

AB The non-destructive deburring and hydrophilic surface machining of 3D printed Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) implants surface is critical for post-processing production of the implants. A green sodium bicarbonate abrasive jet machining technology was proposed in this study, aiming to ensure low damage of implants surface while effectively deburring and creating a hydrophilic surface conducive to cell adhesion. By comparing the machining effects of sodium bicarbonate abrasive and other hard abrasives (alumina and glass bead) under various jet pressures and angles, it was confirmed that sodium bicarbonate abrasive jet machining technology could provide the low damage (Ra = 1.75 similar to 3.73 mu m), moderate machining rate (0.24 similar to 2.26 mg/s), excellent deburring performance, and outstanding surface cleanliness. Based on the comparison of experimental data and finite element simulation results, the fluid characteristics of abrasive particle beam and the combined machining mechanism (compression and plowing effect) of sodium bicarbonate abrasive jet machining technology were determined. Based on the consistent crystal phase and high purity displayed in the characterization of recycled abrasives, the feasibility of the designed abrasive recycling procedure was confirmed. Moreover, the fluorescence staining results of the adherent cell proliferation experiments confirmed that the sodium bicarbonate abrasive jet machining technology could effectively promote cell adhesion and growth by providing the matte elongated scratch-like micro-texture for the PEEK implants surface. In the future, this technology could facilitate the development for post-processing treatments in 3D printed PEEK implants additive manufacturing process.

AB Shellfish farming is considered a highly sustainable form of aquaculture that has developed rapidly worldwide. Unfortunately, today biological and chemical pollution of the oceans and marine waters is widespread and has multiple negative impacts on marine ecosystems, which are exacerbated by global climate changes. In addition, such impacts on fisheries and aquaculture are significant in inducing socio-economic losses. Therefore, it is necessary to develop innovative solutions to improve productivity and environmental performance in line with the blue sustainable economy (European Green Deal).However, one upcoming problem associated with shellfish consumption is shell waste and its disposal. In addition, the percentage of wasted shells destined for reuse is much lower than the one accumulated in landfills or in more or less well-managed sites. This represents a weakness of the shellfish farming sector that can only be mitigated through a project of shellfish waste recycling moving towards the circular economy, with undoubted environmental and economic advantages.In the present study, we present a possible solution for recycling clam shells coming from the waste of the fishing industry (circular economy). Indeed, three eco-friendly bio-reefs for the stabilization and implementation of marine biodiversity (blue economy) were realized using additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) for large dimensions (technological innovation). Furthermore, before deploying the reefs on the sea bottom, they were colonized with oysters to promote repopulation.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is transforming the construction industry by enabling the production of complex structures and components from digital blueprints using materials like concrete, plastics, and recycled materials. This technology reduces material waste, lowers production costs, and opens new possibilities for sustainable and affordable housing. Traditionally used for prototypes and low-volume production, AM has advanced into the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sectors, offering potential solutions to the affordable housing crisis. Concrete 3D printing, for example, can reduce carbon emissions through the use of alternative materials, minimizing the need for raw resources. Additionally, the ability to optimize material usage and reduce construction waste through techniques like prefabrication and rapid construction can significantly lower the cost of building homes. This paper discusses how AM can contribute to addressing the challenges of affordable housing by exploring its applications in construction, its potential for reducing environmental impacts, and its role in improving cost-effectiveness. By integrating AM into manufactured housing models, it becomes possible to develop sustainable, cost-effective homes on a larger scale, which offers a promising solution to the growing demand for affordable housing. Through the widespread adoption of 3D printing technologies, it is feasible to address both affordability and sustainability concerns in the housing sector.

AB The exacerbating water pollution and water resource shortage pose a great danger to human health and make it imperative to recycle and treat the sewage. In this study, a direct-writing three-dimensional (3D) printing technology was adopted to prepare a 3D sodium alginate (SA)/graphene oxide (GO)/Ag nanoparticle (AgNP) aerogel (SGA), aiming to turn the complex sewage containing oil, silt, and bacteria into clean water depending only on gravity separation. The physicochemical properties and surface structure of the synthesized SGA were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The swelling rate, mechanical properties, antibacterial properties, oil and water separation effect, and durable stability of the filter membrane were also investigated to verify the versatility of the SGA filter. The results showed that GO helped improve the mechanical properties of the printed filter to withstand water impact during the filtration process. The printed filter had a well-designed and multiscale gradient pore structure, which can effectively intercept particles with different sizes to separate the silt from water, and the turbidity of the filtered water can be reduced from 60 to 1 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU). The presence of SA endowed the printed filter with hydrophilic and oleophobic behaviors, which can effectively separate various kinds of oils from water. The uniform distribution of AgNPs in the filter produced via a facile and green reduction of SA facilitated the efficient bactericidal ability of the printed filter during the filtration process; meanwhile, the lower release concentration of Ag ions ensured drinking safety. What is more, the filter can be easily produced on a large scale and used for different sewage treatment situations with a durable stability of over 30 days. Taken together, the printed SGA filter has a broad application prospect in complex sewage treatment, providing a special solution for sewage treatment in poverty areas.

AB The main goal of this project was to design and construct a cross-flow turbine rotor model using recycled thermoplastic polymers, with the purpose of reducing the waste of this kind of materials and generating hydroelectricity through them. The proposed model was designed to operate with a flow of 0,02 m3/s and a head of 25.19 m. Two scaled rotor prototypes from the model were fabricated through the fused-deposition modeling process using recycled PETG and PLA filaments. Measurements were done to the dimensions of both rotors to evaluate the additive manufacturing process and to compare those values with the ones obtained theoretically through calculations, proving the viability of properly fabricating this kind of mechanical components through rapid prototyping methods and completing a first step in the research of turbines fabricated with recycled materials.

AB Introduction. In the context of sustainable construction, one of the key challenges is the development of effective strategies for the management and recycling of fly ash and slag waste produced by thermal power plants. Recent studies confirm the potential of such waste as a partial substitute for conventional sand in concrete mixtures. However, most research focuses on conventional concrete and does not consider the specific requirements for rheological properties and interlayer adhesion, which are critical for 3D printing technology. Methods and Materials. The study used Portland cement CEM I42.5N, fly ash and slag waste from the Ust-KamenogorskTPP, crushed sand, and the MasterGlenium superplasticizer. The concrete mix design was developed in stages: a base mix, a control mix (with an increased water-to-cement ratio), and experimental mixes with 25% and 50% sand replacement by fly ash and slag waste. Samples were printed using a construction 3D printer (model S-6045) and tested for compressive strength, density, interlayer adhesion, and subjected to micro and nanostructural analysis. Results and Discussion. Experimental mixtures with 25% and 50% sand replacement showed reduced density and strength compared to the control mix. However, the 25% replacement mix maintained satisfactory strength, shape stability, and interlayer bonding. Micro and nanostructural analysis confirmed the relationship between structural compaction and physical-mechanical properties. Despite some limitations, the study demonstrated the potential of TPP-derived ash and slag waste as a viable component in 3D printing, provided the composition and extrusion parameters are optimized. Conclusion. The results indicate that replacing 25% of sand with fly ash and slag waste is optimal forfine-grained concrete mixtures intended for 3D printing. This approach improves resource efficiency and environmental sustainability without compromising the performance of the final products.

DE 3D concrete printing; waste; 1K; sustainability
AB A critical aspect of sustainable manufacture is the minimisation of waste, and this is especially important due to the relatively high embodied carbon content of the materials used in 3DCP, however, waste production is largely unreported. This article addresses this gap by presenting a case study based on the manufacture of three similar 250-300 kg panels, where material mass was tracked through all stages of production. A new methodology for systematic waste monitoring is presented and for the case studied, the total waste material was found to be 11-14%, and observed that problems during manufacture, can also lead to excessive machine run time and associated energy consumption. The work suggests that waste could be reduced to 7% to 10% in a 'best-case' production setting. The work also highlights the sensitivity to human error/judgement in increasing waste, as well as utilising recycling of printed material during printing to reduce waste, which is straight forward in 1K systems, but suggests that 2K approaches with rapid setting could be much more sensitive to poor operation.

AB Printed circuit boards represent an extraordinarily challenging fraction for the recycling of waste electric and electronic equipment. Due to the closely interlinked structure of the composing materials, the selective recycling of copper and closely associated precious metals from this composite material is compromised by losses during mechanical pre-processing. This problem could partially be overcome by a better understanding of the influence of particle size and shape on the recovery of finely comminuted and well-liberated metal particles during mechanical separation. Here, we propose a workflow to quantify the role of the size and shape of such particles in various separation processes. As a case study, we compare an analytical heavy liquid separation to a new type of eddy current separator. Using X-ray computed tomography, we were able to distinguish metallic and non-metallic phases and determine the size and 3D microstructure of individual particles. For both separation processes, we trained a particle-based separation model that predicts the probability of individual particles to end up in the processing products. In particular, elongated particles were found to display a negative correlation between particle size and sphericity of metallic particles. In line with this correlation, the predicted metal recoveries are positively correlated with particle size but negatively correlated with sphericity in both separation processes. The suggested workflow is easily transferred to other recycling material systems. It allows to quantify the role of 3D geometrical particle properties in separation processes and provide robust predictions for the recoverability of different raw materials in complex recycling streams.

AB This paper presents the results of research on the technical-economic optimization of FDM parameters (Lh-layer height and Id-infill density percentage) for the manufacture of tensile and compression samples from recycled materials (r) of PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) and ASA (acrylonitrile styrene acrylate) in the context of the transition to a circular economy. To carry out our technical-economic study, the fundamental principle of value analysis was used, which consists of maximizing the ratio between Vi and Cp, where Vi represents the mechanical characteristic (tensile strength or compressive strength) and Cp represents the production cost. The results of this study showed that, in the case of tensile samples manufactured by recycled PETG (rPETG), the parameter that significantly influences the results of the Vi/Cp ratios is Lh (the height of the layer), while for the samples manufactured additively from recycled ASA (rASA), the parameter that decisively influences the tensile strength is Id (the infill density percentage). In the case of compression samples manufactured by FDM from recycled PETG (rPETG) and recycled ASA (rASA), the parameter that signified influences the results of the Vi/Cp ratios is Id (the infill density percentage). Following the optimization of the FDM parameters, using multiple-response optimization, we identified the optimal parameters for the manufacture of parts by FDM from rPETG and rASA: Lh = 0.20 mm and Id = 100%. The results of this study demonstrated that the use of recycled plastics from PETG and ASA lends itself to a production and consumption model based on a circular economy.

SO ACS OMEGA
LA English
DT Article
ID GENOSENSOR; ELECTRODES
AB Herein, we present the first 3D-printed electrochemical portable biodevice for the detection of monkeypox virus (MKPV). The electrochemical device consists of two biosensors: an immunosensor and a genosensor specifically designed for the detection of the protein A29 and a target DNA of MKPV, respectively. The electrodes were manufactured using lab-made ultraflexible conductive filaments composed of carbon black, recycled PLA from coffee pods, and castor oil as a plasticizer. The sensors created through 3D printing technology exhibited good reproducibility and repeatability of analytical responses. Furthermore, both the immunosensor and genosensor demonstrated excellent MKPV detection capabilities, with a linear range from 0.01 to 1.0 mu mol L-1 for the antigen and 0.1 to 20.0 mu mol L-1 for the DNA target. The biosensors achieved limits of detection of 2.7 and 29 nmol L-1 for the immunosensor and genosensor, respectively. Interference tests conducted with the biosensors demonstrated their selectivity for MKPV. Moreover, analyses of fortified human serum samples showed recoveries close to 100%, confirming the absence of significant matrix effects for MKPV analysis. Therefore, the 3D-printed multiplex device represents a viable and highly promising alternative for on-site, portable, and rapid point-of-care MKPV monitoring.

AB The increasing amount of tires manufactured annually worldwide has made waste tire management a major environmental concern. The goal of this work is to investigate the potential applications of waste tire aggregates (WTA) in a novel class of affordable, recycled composite materials. This study assesses the material behavior of rubberized 3D printed lightweight cement composites (3DLC) reinforced with raw micro attapulgite (ATP) and micro steel fibers (MSF) using WTA as a 100 % replacement for fine aggregate manufactured through 3D printing. The paper takes advantage of 3D concrete printing's advantages and addresses the environmental issues associated with waste tires. The extrudability and buildability properties of 3DLC are determined in the fresh state. Physical and thermal properties of 3DLC were determined. Mechanical properties of 3DLC including compressive, flexural, shear strength and flexural toughness were assessed. 3D printed samples were exposed to high temperature and sulfate (MgSO4), and their durability properties were determined. The microstructures of the mixes was analyzed. The CO2 emissions and costs of the blends were also assessed. The outcomes revealed that, the 3DLC mixture with 10 % ATP and 2 % MSF showed the greatest compressive strength performance, with increases of 17.82 and 29.51 % at 28 and 90 days, respectively relative to the mixture without ATP. Regardless of MSF level, at 28 and 90 days, all mixes with 10%ATP content showed the largest flexural strengths. The 3DLC mixture with 10 % ATP and 2 % MSF had the highest measured thermal conductivity. The blends with 20 % ATP and 0 % MSF showed the lowest thermal conductivity. The mixture containing 10 % ATP and 2 % MSF demonstrated the greatest high temperature performance, demonstrating strength enhancement of 21.85, 6.72 and 3.36 % at 200,400 and 600 degrees C respectively. Replacing cement with 10 and 20%ATP greatly increased the sulfate resistance of 3DLC mixtures and the mixture with 20%ATP and 2%MSF exhibited the best sulfate performance. The lowest CO2 emission and cost were determined for the mixture containing 20%ATP and 0%MSF (A20S0).

AB This article discusses how the integration of 3D printing and composite fibre manufacturing with the Internet of Things (IoT) and circular economy can create a revolution in sustainable production processes, exploring the possibilities and challenges that such a convergence brings. IoT integrates a network of connected devices and sensors to provide real-time data monitoring and predictive analytics, tackling pressing inefficiencies in conventional manufacturing. The integration of IoT and circular economy functions in additive manufacturing processes enables meticulous managing of resource utilisation, material optimisation, and energy efficiency, ultimately minimising the environmental impact. When derived from renewable or recycled materials, composite fibre materials with superior mechanical, thermal, and chemical characteristics also reflect sustainability ideals. The review consolidates recent IoT-enabled manufacturing progresses, emphasising innovations related to real-time monitoring, defect detection, and predictive maintenance integrated with composite 3D printing and circular economy. It also addresses challenges like interoperability, cyber security risks, and scalability and suggests techniques like modular IoT architectures and artificial intelligence analytics as answers. Furthermore, this paper emphasises innovative approaches to enhancing eco-friendly production systems, focusing on sustainable materials and energy-efficient IoT-based monitoring and circular economy. The future research directions highlighted above encourage researchers to establish more standardised approaches towards IoT-dependent frameworks and investigate bio-based composite materials.

AB Biomedical field has been seeking a feasible standard drug screening system consisting of 3D tumor model array for drug researching due to providing sufficient samples and simulating actual in vivo tumor growth situation, which is still a challenge to rapidly and uniformly establish though. Here, we propose a novel drug screening system, namely 3D tumor array chip with "layer cake" structure, for drug screening. Accurate gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel droplets (similar to 0.1 mu L) containing tumor cells can be automatically deposited on demand with electrohydrodynamic 3D printing. Transparent conductive membrane is introduced as a chip basement for preventing charges accumulation during fabricating and convenient observing during screening. Culturing chambers formed by stainless steel and silicon interlayer is convenient to be assembled and recycled. As this chip is compatible with the existing 96-well culturing plate, the drug screening protocols could keep the same as convention. Important properties of this chip, namely printing stability, customizability, accuracy, microenvironment, tumor functionalization, are detailly examined. As a demonstration, it is applied for screening of epirubicin and paclitaxel with breast tumor cells to confirm the compatibility of the proposed screening system with the traditional screening methods. We believe this chip will potentially play a significant role in drug evaluation in the future.

AB Three-Dimensional Printing (3D Printing) is one of the advanced manufacturing technologies which is being tremendously used in many fields because of its innovative applications. The concept of making a three-dimensional product by adding the material layer upon layer through Computer Aided Design (CAD) file data as input source is known as 3D Printing. Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is one of the leading technologies from all the available 3D Printing technologies, because of its easy operation, high accuracy with less running and maintenance costs. FDM uses different types of plastic materials in the form of filaments as input material for producing a three-dimensional product. Sustainable Manufacturing (SM) is the universal acronym for representing the practice of effectively using the resources by fulfilling the needs of present generations without compromising the needs of future generations. It focuses on environment, economy and society. Green Manufacturing (GM) approaches like reduce, reuse and recycle are used to attain sustainability. Evaluations through trails on ASTM D638 Type-IV tensile test 3D printed specimens by altering the input process parameters on FDM with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) as material had been worked out in the present study. By employing Taguchi optimization approaches, Design of Experiments (DOE) have been performed to explore how various input process factors impacts the use of energy consumption, emissions of CO2, and mechanical attributes. Percentage contribution of process factors on responses has been find out through Analysis of Variance. The study on reducing the energy consumption and emission of CO(2)has been highlighted for attaining sustainability through green manufacturing approach.

AB The first recycled conductive poly(lactic acid) (PLA) filament derived from post-industrial waste sources for additive manufacturing (AM) is reported herein, presenting a paradigm shift in plastic waste recycling, AM filament production, and AM energy storage architectures. Filaments utilizing a base of recycled PLA, carbon black (CB) as a conductive filler, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a plasticizer are used to produce aqueous AM symmetric supercapacitor platforms that can reach capacitance values 75 times higher than commercially available conductive PLA filaments. Furthermore, through the rapid prototyping capabilities of AM and GCode modification, it is seen that changing the electrode architecture from solid to a mesh with additional inter-layer spacing is able to further enhance electrode performance by 3.5 times due to improvements in the surface area, ion accommodating capabilities and faster ion diffusion. The symmetric full cell device is capable of delivering 7.82 mF cm(-2), 4.82 mu Wh cm(-2,) and 433.32 mu W cm(-2) of capacitance, energy, and power density, respectively. Moreover, the material cost is 0.15 pound per electrode. This work represents a new direction for plastic waste recycling, in which low-value recycled base products can be manufactured into high-value end products in their second cycles.

AB Distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) emphasizes an emerging approach to locally recycle waste plastic by 3D-printing it into valuable products. Although major progress has been reported in the last decade to validate the technical feasibility, and economic viability of the DRAM as an unitary operation, the environmental evaluation of this approach is still at its early stage as a distributed recycling network. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the environmental impact of a DRAM unit as a baseline scenario, compared to two scenarios of the virgin supply chain plastic filament used in the printing process. To achieve this goal, a comparative environmental performance using a life cycle assessment (LCA) is performed to estimate the multidimensional potential impacts of virgin and recycled polylactic acid (PLA). The study takes place using a physical recycling demonstrator developed at a university in Nancy, France. Four impact categories were considered: climate change, potential eutrophication (Freshwater and Marine), resource depletion (Fossil and Water), and ion radiation. For the first three impact categories, the results demonstrate a minimum 97% reduction in environmental impact compared to a virgin supply chain. However, in terms of ion radiation, the amount of emissions is approximately 2.8 times higher than that of the virgin plastic scenario. This increase is mainly due to the specific situation in France, where most of the energy is generated using nuclear means. This study aims to expand on the environmental assessment of the plastic recycling network system to better understand the implementation of these systems for waste plastic management, which can help extend the lifetime of plastic material. The findings provide an environmental overview of the benefits and disadvantages of developing a DRAM system in a particular context.

AB The interest in sustainable materials and technologies has increased significantly due to environmental issues triggered by using plastics and their associated wastes. Every year more than 400 million metric tons (Mt) of plastic production takes place globally, out of which 350 Mt plastic convert into plastic waste. Plastic waste mostly consists of polyolefin and their contribution to plastic waste is approximately 50%. Therefore, this review is focused on upcycling polyolefin waste by manufacturing natural/sustainable filler-based biocomposites. This is the novelty of the present review as a detailed review of the manufacturing of polyolefin waste-based biocomposites and their 3D printing suitability is not available in the literature. Natural filler-based biocomposites reduce the use of synthetic filler and help to move towards sustainability goals. This review starts with an overview of plastic waste generation and recycling techniques. A detailed discussion has been done on manufacturing waste polyolefin-based biocomposites and the effect of various fillers and compatibilizers on different properties. These biocomposites are found to be used for trays, packaging boxes, reusable bags, false ceilings, flooring, boundary walls, tiles, cabinets, chairs, tables, doors, designer pots, and automotive interior applications. In the later section, the scope of additive manufacturing of recycled polyolefin waste-based biocomposites along with their associated problems and their solution is also discussed. This review is concluded with the future potential of polyolefin waste upcycling in the sustainable filler-based biocomposites manufacturing sector.

AB The new manufacturing technologies are advancing and developing rapidly, gradually causing some conven-tional processes used until now to become obsolete or relegated to second place. One of the challenges of emerging manufacturing processes is sustainability, decreasing raw materials and recycling used components. Additive manufacturing is among these new technologies, allowing the fabrication of complex geometries and the reduction of waste by producing parts close to their commissioning (i.e., net-shape or near-net-shape manufacturing) and the recycling of used components to develop raw material. One of the most widely used thermoplastic materials in manufacturing is polyether ether ketone (PEEK), mainly due to its good mechanical properties. The use of fibers as a means of reinforcement in polymeric materials has witnessed a significant surge in recent times to enhance mechanical properties. Recycling these fibers from other components after service life, giving a second life to these materials, would have a high impact in terms of sustainability. CFRPs have been widely used in different sectors in the last decades, providing a source of carbon fibers suitable for use as polymer reinforcement in additive manufacturing. Processing operations are often necessary to reach dimensional and joining (e.g., assembly) specifications. Despite its widespread use in the industry requiring certain postprocessing operations, just a few publications analyze the machinability of PEEK polymer. The addition of carbon fiber reinforcement influences the machinability of the polymer. This study uses orthogonal cutting tests to focus on the machinability of 3D printed PEEK with and without short carbon fiber reinforcement through orthogonal cutting tests. The additive process procedure is analyzed in terms of printing orientations. The effect of machining parameters (cutting speed and the depth of cut) on the force generation, the superficial damage, and the temperature reached in the samples are also analyzed and related with the addition of reinforcement.

AB The achievement of sustainable development goals should be driven not only by environmental policies but also considering societal constraints, such as the valorisation of local traditions, especially in emerging countries. In the field of construction engineering, 3D printing can be seen as a modern technique which allows reproducing traditional constructions, such as those made in adobe and cob, using local and natural materials, e.g. soils, and even recycled ones, thus reducing the impacts related to the production and transport of the raw materials. The environmental and economic advantages of additive manufacturing are widely recognized for several applications: 3D printing does not require molds and allows to save material, obtaining complex shapes easily. The main advantages are linked to save money, time, handwork and properly reducing the environmental impact of structures.
   In this paper the results of an experimental campaign aimed at selecting earth-based sustainable mixes for 3D printing are shown. At the beginning of the experimental campaign, 18 mixes were prepared varying the dosage and the components: among them, we selected locally available soil, silica sand, hydraulic lime binder, unaltered rice husk, shredded rice husk, marble waste dust, municipal solid waste incinerator bottom ash and fibres. Each mixture has been evaluated in terms of printability, then mechanical tests were performed at 28 days of curing. Finally, an efficiency evaluation of mixture is carried out considering compressive strength, price and embodied carbon as affecting parameters.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is a well-established technique that allows for the development of complex geometries and structures with multiple applications. While considered a more environmentally-friendly method than traditional manufacturing, a significant challenge lies in the availability and ease of synthesis of bio-based alternative resins. In our endeavor to valorize biomass, this work proposes the synthesis of new alpha,omega-dienes derived from cellulose-derived levoglucosenone (LGO). These dienes are not only straightforward to synthesize but also offer a tunable synthesis approach. Specifically, LGO is first converted into diol precursor, which is subsequently esterified using various carboxylic acids (in this case, 3-butenoic, and 4-pentenoic acids) through a straightforward chemical pathway. The resulting monomers were then employed in UV-activated thiol-ene chemistry for digital light process (DLP). A comprehensive study of the UV-curing process was carried out by Design of Experiment (DoE) to evaluate the influence of light intensity and photoinitiator to find the optimal curing conditions. Subsequently, a thorough thermo-mechanical characterization highlighted the influence of the chemical structure on material properties. 3D printing was performed, enabling the fabrication of complex and self-stain structures with remarkable accuracy and precision. Lastly, a chemical degradation study revealed the potential for end-of-use recycling of the bio-based thermosets.
   LGO was used as bio-based source to develop new bio-based allyl-functional monomers. The synthesized monomers were exploited in a UV-curing process through thiol-ene chemistry. DLP 3D printing was embraced to further increase the possible applications of these bio-based derivatives. Finally, the chemical degradability was assessed to meet the circular economy principles. image

AB The paper deals with the actual topic of mechanical properties of 3D prints made from the polymer material rPET-G and its changes. Using this material in additive technology has great potential in the automotive industry. The research evaluates five different post-processing modifications of 3D prints from rPET-G (recycled polyethylene terephthalate-glycol) material produced by the Fused Filament Fabrication technology. The post-processing included the chemical smoothing of the samples using dichloromethane vapors and heat treatment in an annealing furnace. An epoxy resin, a synthetic coating, and a water-based coating were also applied. The standard was represented by samples without post-processing modifications, both in the form of recycled material and in the form of virgin PET-G. The texture of the samples was evaluated according to EN ISO 4287. Furthermore, the moisture absorption of the samples was evaluated using the gravimetric method according to EN ISO 62. The mechanical testing of the samples was carried out using a tensile test (EN ISO 527-2), a three-point bending test (EN ISO 178), impact strength (EN ISO 179-2), and a cupping test (EN ISO 1520). Degradation of the coatings took place using cyclic tests, which used a combination of exposure in a salt fog environment and in a climate chamber. The results of the experiments indicate that heat treatment appears to be a universal post-processing technology, as this method statistically improves not only the mechanical properties but also significantly reduces moisture absorption.

AB This project combines 3D printing and conventional hand-building of unfired clay to leverage each strength in creating custom, zero-waste, reusable formwork. The fabrication method relies on the plasticity and water-solubility of clay in an unfired state to permit the production of larger, more complex clay formwork. This is achieved through the aggregation of 3D-printed units with hand joinery. Since unfired clay possesses limited strength and struggles to hold its weight, shredded paper was introduced. The research first explores the compressive strength of clay with various ratios of added paper. The process of creating paper clay is explained, and its ratios are documented. Next, fabrication case studies at multiple scales are introduced to explore paper clay's viability as a formwork. The paper clay self-demolds as it dries, shrinks, and falls off the concrete form. This allowed all the clay to be conserved. All clay from the test was rehydrated and recycled to be reused. The fabrication tests demonstrated the effectiveness of the fabrication workflow. The results point to future research that may reduce the embodied carbon emissions of concrete casting through formwork recycling.

AB A straightforward manufacture strategy is proposed to obtain an efficient and robust palladium-alumina (Pd0/Al2O3) cermet monolithic catalyst, specifically designed to perform safe microwave assisted organic synthesis (MAOS). In this approach, a cermet catalyst with high surface area, controlled composition and adapted shape and dimensions to a microwave reactor vessel is generated via 3D printing technology and sintering. The resulting catalyst has been explored in heterogeneous Suzuki, Sonogashira, Stille and Heck cross-coupling reactions, in MAOS. The Pd0 catalyst is permanently active, stable, without leaching and can be recycled and reused at least 200 reaction cycles. The generation of hot spots, sparking or hazardous discharges is controlled by the effective immobilization of the palladium in the monolithic structure during the reaction. The palladium content is forming part of both the internal and external structure, providing greater mechanical resistance and catalytic activity with respect to the basic ceramic material (alumina).

AB Currently, additive manufacturing become an expanding industry which committing high demand of plastic. Consequently, plastic waste generated will be increased exponentially. Polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are extensively used polymer as the filament for 3D printing. Therefore, the reprocessing of the fragments is necessary to reduce the plastic pollution. This study the aims to investigate the conversion of PET to terephthalic acid (TPA) and its conversion breakthrough via caustic soda hydrolysis. Meanwhile, the effect of PLA dissolution and its integration with glycerol to produced bioplastic was investigated. Fragment of PET was undergone hydrolysis process at different time and the conversion rate showed increment as prolong reaction time. TPA yield produced follow the same trend of PET conversion. FTIR analysis proved the formation of TPA after the hydrolysis process due to the formation of O-H and C-H which corresponding to the formation of carboxylic acid and ethylene glycol of TPA. Concurrently, PLA was dissolved in chloroform at different time and mixed with glycerol which acts as plasticizer to form PLA/glycerol plastic. It was found that the longer dissolution time, the higher the percentage of PLA dissolved. From FTIR analysis, the functional group of PLA has changed indicated that the reaction between dissolved PLA and glycerol has been taken placed. The results indicate that PET degradation can occur at low cost and on this basis. Ergo, this formation of valuable products from waste polymers can be an alternative method in promoting reduced waste generation. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing is essential for space missions, enabling on-demand production of components where resupply from Earth is limited. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) offers a promising route for repurposing plastic packaging waste into 3D printing feedstock. Low-density polyethylene (LDPE), commonly used in space packaging, can be combined with lunar regolith simulant to increase material availability for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). However, the method of incorporating regolith into the polymer matrix affects filament quality and printability. Here, we compare single-screw and twin-screw extrusion techniques for producing LDPE/ regolith composite filaments containing up to 30 wt% regolith. Both methods successfully produced filaments suitable for FDM, though single-screw extrusion required a second extrusion step above 10 wt% regolith. Filaments were evaluated for diameter consistency and printability, including the successful fabrication of NASAdesigned parts. Regolith addition enhances print performance by improving overhang formation, gap bridging, and reducing warpage. Tensile testing shows increased stiffness without compromising strength up to 20 wt% regolith. These results demonstrate that LDPE and lunar regolith can be effectively processed into printable feedstock, supporting sustainable manufacturing strategies for lunar applications and advancing terrestrial plastic waste recycling.

AB Lattice materials are one of the most desirable and widely used materials due to the characteristics derived from their geometrical formation as opposed to their chemical composition. In this article, a lattice material has been designed and printed using polymer filament wire made of polylactic acid (PLA) and fused deposition modelling (FDM), followed by mechanical testing. In addition, tensile testing of the PLA printed samples has also been carried out to ascertain the tensile properties of the material in use, and the material has shown 38-40 MPa tensile strength with a Young's modulus value of 1538 +/- 120 MPa. The lattice was designed using 3D CAD software, and numerical results were obtained using the Autodesk Inventor simulation module. In addition to the experimental test, theoretical tests were also conducted, and the results were compared to the experimental results. With this methodology, the lattice material failure process can be comprehended. Along with the lattices, the PLA tensile test samples were also prepared and tested to check the feasibility of the PLA being used and ascertain the properties. In addition, it has been observed that after a specific load and deformation, the material's resistance increases due to its increased density and repeated cell interference. The major purpose of the study is to explore the aspects and feasibility of the PLA printed lattice material with complex shapes and explore the application potential of such shapes.

AB One of the useful features of 3D-printed specimens of recycled polyethylene terephthalate glycol (R-PETG) is the ability to repetitively develop free recovery as well as the work-generating, shape-memory effect. This behavior is enabled by the R-PETG's capacity to stiffen during cooling, thus allowing for a new temporary shape to be induced. Aiming to devise an explanation for the polymer's stiffening, in this study, the variation in some of the R-PETG's parameters during cooling are emphasized and discussed. The evolution of an R-PETG filament's shape was monitored during room-temperature-bending heating-cooling cycles. Straight-shape recovery and the complete loss of stiffness were observed at the start and the end of heating, respectively, followed by the forced straightening of the filament, performed by the operator, around 40 degrees C, during cooling. The tests performed by dynamic mechanical analysis disclosed the rise of the storage modulus (E') after 100 degrees C heating followed by either liquid-nitrogen- or air-cooling to room temperature, in such a way that E' was always larger after cooling than initially. Static tests emphasized a peculiar stress variation during a heating-cooling cycle applied in air, within the heating chamber of the tensile testing machine. Tensile-failure tests were performed at -10 degrees C at a rate of 100 mm/min, with specimens printed at various deposition directions between 10 and 40 degrees to the transversal direction. The specimens printed at 40 degrees, which had the largest ultimate strains, were broken with tensile rates between 100 and 500 mm/min. Deformation rate increase favored the shift from crazing to delamination failure modes. The correlation between the structural changes, the sharp E' increase on heating, and the stiffening induced by cooling represents a novel approach that enables the use of 3D-printed R-PETG for the fabrication of the active parts of low-priced lightweight resettable actuators.

AB The importance of numerical modeling and simulation approaches increases with increased scale as it allows for early results predictions. This study evaluated the buildability of novel construction and demolition waste (CDW)-based geopolymer materials for 3-dimensional printing (3DP) structures for the built environment. The feasibility of the developed numerical model for 3DP of built environment structures was also evaluated. This study reported the fresh-state properties of geopolymer-based materials, and based on these results, numerical modeling for 3DP of geopolymer material was performed. Three cylindrical structures with diameters of 300 mm, 450 mm, and 600 mm were printed, with the same printing conditions, resulting in buildability of 352.5 mm, 322.5 mm, and 277.5 mm (total height constructed before the collapse), respectively. In the next stage of the study, a comparative analysis was performed to assess the compatibility of numerical models for CDW-based geopolymer materials. In the numerical results, three structures showed early failure prediction from experimental results at 31.91%, 29.10%, and 29.73%, respectively. The geopolymer materials developed were suitable for 3DP, and close agreement in results and repeatability were observed. The numerical model provided a reliable failure prediction for different structures. Hence, the model can be utilized to evaluate the buildability of the structures before the actual 3DP, which can significantly reduce the time and cost of the project.

AB In this study, a novel route for the preparation of feedstock filaments for fused deposition modelling from recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE) waste polymers has been explored. For improving the properties of HDPE/LDPE-recycled polymers, Fe powder has been reinforced through single-screw extrusion. It has been observed that Fe powder (from 0 wt% to 25 wt%) in the LDPE and HDPE matrices has shown increasing trend in melt flow index. Furthermore, Fe powder reinforcement resulted in 36.66% improvement in hardness of reinforced HDPE polymer and 64% in LDPE. Mechanical properties (peak elongation, peak strength, break strength and shore D hardness (SDH)) have been improved significantly with the addition of 6 wt% and 10 wt% reinforcement of Fe powder in the matrix of LDPE and HDPE, respectively. The results of study suggest that morphological properties, such as SDH and percentage porosity, have direct relation with mechanical properties as it has been found that the sample with better mechanical properties was also having high hardness and low porosity. Scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy have been performed on 3D printed functional parts and it has been observed that highly dense texture of HDPE and low surface roughness resulted in better mechanical properties.

AB This study examines the impact of self-polymerized polydopamine (PDA) coating on the mechanical, rheological, and microstructural properties of recycled polylactic acid (rPLA)/kenaf fiber (KF) composites fabricated via Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Biodegradable filaments were produced by reinforcing rPLA with 5-20 wt% bast kenaf fibers and coating them with dopamine prior to melt compounding. Mechanical tests (tensile, flexural, and compression) revealed that PDA treatment substantially enhances fiber-matrix adhesion, leading to significant improvements in tensile yield stress (up to 21.92 MPa) and ultimate tensile strength (44.5 MPa), far exceeding uncoated rPLA (14.42 MPa and 18.6 MPa, respectively). Flexural strength peaked at 54.7 MPa for the 5 wt% composite, while 20 wt% kenaf markedly boosted compression strength to 65.4 MPa roughly 74 % above neat rPLA. Rheological measurements indicated that moderate fiber loadings (<= 10 wt%) and PDA coating stabilize melt flow, minimizing clogging risks and supporting uniform extrusion. By contrast, higher fiber contents induced particle agglomeration and viscous instabilities, complicating FDM processability. Microscopic analyses verified that PDA-mediated bonding reduces crack propagation, despite increased porosity from higher kenaf additions. Overall, this bioinspired surface modification strategy yields sustainable rPLA-based composites with notably enhanced mechanical and favorable rheological behavior, highlighting promising applications in 3D printing and related industries.

AB Physical entrapment of enzymes within a porous matrix is a fast and gentle process to immobilize biocatalysts to enable their recycling and long-term use. This study introduces the development of a biocompatible 3D-printing material suitable for enzyme entrapment, while having good rheological and UV-hardening properties. Three different viscosity-enhancing additives have been tested in combination with a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-based hydrogel system. The addition of polyxanthan or hectorite clay particles results in hydrogels that degrade over hours or days, releasing entrapped compounds. In contrast, the addition of nanometer-sized silicate particles ensures processability while preventing disintegration of the hydrogel. Lattice structures with a total height of 6 mm consisting of 40 layers were 3D-printed with all materials and characterized by image analysis. Rheological measurements identified a shear stress window of 200 < tau < 500 Pa at shear rates of 25 s(-1) and 25 degrees C for well-defined geometries with an extrusion-based printhead. Enzymes immobilized in these long-term stable hydrogel structures retained an effective activity of approximately 10% compared to the free enzyme in solution. It could be shown that the reduction of effective activity is not caused by a significant reduction of the intrinsic enzyme activity but by mass transfer limitations within the printed hydro gel structures.

AB Soft actuators have brought significant advancements to robotics, allowing robots to perform a diverse range of tasks across various domains. However, the increased use of soft actuators has resulted in negative environmental impacts, including material consumption, waste generation, and energy consumption. To address these challenges, research is increasingly focused on developing sustainable soft actuators (SSAs) that can provide high performance while minimizing environmental harm. This review article aims to explore the development and manufacturing of SSAs and their potential to reduce material waste and energy consumption promoting sustainability. The article examines various categories of soft actuators, such as multi-responsive ones, shape-locking variants, and biological water-responsive models, as well as their implementation through multi-material printing and, 3D and 4D printing techniques. The article also highlights the potential applications of these SSAs, including manufacturing, human-machine interaction, locomotion, and manipulation. Furthermore, the review explores various methods for reducing energy consumption and material waste in soft actuators, such as using recycled materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes for a circular economy. Finally, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of SSAs and their potential to steer the evolution of robotics towards a more sustainable future and a circular economy.

AB Engineering polyesters, particularly poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), are widely used but generate significant waste, with limited recycling options. Existing mechanical and chemical recycling strategies struggle to sustainably and efficiently reuse PBT, resulting in product performance degradation and making the recycling process more costly than the upstream synthesis routes for raw materials. Inspired by DNA editing technologies in molecular biology, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to sequentially modify the backbone and end groups of end-of-life PBT, transforming it into a high-performance, sustainable, and 3D-printable poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) platform. Unlike traditional commercial PBATs that produce only single components, this platform surpasses them in tensile strength and toughness without requiring additional additives and features programmable properties for diverse applications, including injection-molded parts, 3D-printed components, films, packaging, fibers, and fabrics. The industrial scalability of this strategy is validated through successful 100-L pilot-scale production. The resulting PBAT allows closed-loop polymer-to-polymer recycling by reintroducing PBT or monomers, thereby enhancing its social sustainability. When recovery is no longer feasible, the materials remain ecologically sustainable through composting, avoiding harmful environmental accumulation. This work achieves a direct polymer-to-polymer conversion of end-of-life PBT into high-performance materials, with techno-economic analysis highlighting both environmental and economic advantages.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This study investigated the flexural properties of sandwich panel structures fabricated by the filament-extrusion 3D printing technology using novel high-temperature thermoplastic polymer composites of polyetherimide (PEI) and polyphenylene sulfide (PPS). Various formulations of PEI and PPS composites, combined with recycled carbon fiber (rCF) and thermal black (TB) particles, were manufactured. The flexural properties were assessed through a three-point bending test, comparing the performance of sandwich panels printed with these filaments and those printed with commercially available filaments. Dimensional accuracy was evaluated using a 3D scanner, revealing that 90 % of scanned points deviated a maximum of 0.2 mm from the CAD model. X-ray micro-tomography measured porosity, finding up to similar to 12 % in PEI and similar to 8 % in PPS skins. The microstructural analysis of the composites revealed a level of adhesion deemed acceptable between successive layers of printed parts and adequate dimensional accuracy. A digital image correlation (DIC) system assessed full-field strain and crack propagation during flexural testing, showing crack initiation due to strain concentration in the core region, consistent across all specimens. The sandwich panels printed with developed filaments exhibited comparable flexural properties to that of panels printed with commercial filaments, with a bending load capacity of up to 3.0 kN for approximately 50 g specimens. The printing quality and mechanical performance of the novel PEI and PPS composite formulations demonstrated in this study suggested that they could serve as viable alternatives to commercial filaments.

AB A ratiometric photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing strategy was proposed for monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) based on a homemade 3D printing device with dual-working photoelectrodes (PE1 and PE2), coupling lambda-exonuclease (lambda-Exo)-assisted recycling amplification with CdS quantum dots. Gold nanoparticles-functionalized ZnO nanorods were utilized as PEC substrate for generating initial photocurrent and immobilizing DNA probe. Upon incubation of target with DNA trigger/CEA aptamer-modified magnetic bead (tri/apt-MB), DNA trigger dissociated from magnetic bead and then hybridized with capture probe (cp) on PE1 or opened hairpin probe (hp) on PE2 to form double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The exonuclease could recognize and cleave two newly generated dsDNA, leading to the release of trigger. The free trigger strand continued to hybridize with the remaining cp/hp, which were cleaved by lambda-Exo, and then trigger was released again and restarted next recycle with the lambda-Exo. After digestion of lambda-Exo, the number of capture probes on PE1 was reduced, and many short DNA fragments were produced on PE2, thereby resulting in the decreasing CdS QDs on PE1 and the increasing CdS QDs on PE2. As a result, it was observed that the ratio value of photocurrents (PE1/PE2) significantly decreased with the increasing CEA. Under optimum conditions, the sensing method showed a good linear relationship toward CEA within the dynamic range of 0.02-10 ng mL(-1) and a detection limit of 6.0 pg mL(-1). Moreover, the ratiometric PEC sensor exhibited good reproducibility, satisfying stability, and remarkable anti-interference performance, which suggests its promising application prospect to detect target CEA.

AB The industrial demand for functional filaments made of bio-sourced, biocompatible, biodegradable, and/or recyclable polymers and composites for material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing is continuously growing. Polylactic acid (PLA), the most popular filament, combines such properties, yet its reinforcement with low-cost, inert, and/or recycled fillers remains challenging. Herein, glass in three different micro/nano-forms was the reinforcement agent in PLA. Three different experimental tiers were elaborated by producing composite filaments with glass in powder, beads, and flake forms in various loadings to optimize the concentrations. A thermomechanical process, i.e., melt filament extrusion, was exploited. The composites were evaluated for their thermal degradation stability and composition using thermogravimetric analysis and Raman. MEX 3D printing was used to produce tensile, flexural, impact, and microhardness specimens, to quantitatively evaluate their mechanical response. Field emission scanning electron microscopy evaluation and fractography were carried out to depict fracture patterns of the specimens after their tests. All three glass types induced impressive reinforcement effects (up to 60% in flexural loading), especially in the flake form. The impact of the additional process cost through glass fillers implementation was also assessed, indicating that such composites are cost-effective.

AB Some small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are involved in recycling plastic waste to produce innovative products. These SMEs have adopted digital technologies, such as 3D printing and blockchain, to gain competitive advantage from their circular economy (CE)-based business models. However, the specific capabilities needed to create value for customers and to generate a competitive advantage for such SMEs are not known. In this study, we conducted in-depth interviews with four SMEs engaged in the CE to identify the specific resources and capabilities needed to provide value to customers. Our findings reveal that SMEs focusing on circular economy initiatives demonstrate exploitation and adaptive capabilities in utilising their CE resources followed by exploration and adaptive capabilities while implementing digital technologies. Our study extends the resource-based view by combining it with ambidexterity to explain the role of specific circular and digital resources and capabilities that SMEs need to provide value to their customers.

AB Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are enzymes that can function at physiologic interfaces and catalyze the interfacial conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into bicarbonate (HCO3-) with an extraordinarily high catalytic efficiency. Even though CAs have potential to be used for CO(2 )sequestration, significant mass transfer resistance and poor enzyme stability at gas-liquid interface often limit the effectiveness of the enzyme. Here, we report a density-adjustable 3D-printed platform, which can accommodate electrospun polymer fibers with immobilized CA and enable the positioning of immobilized CA in an air-water biphasic system. By using 3D printing, we fabricate interfacial devices consisting of two floating units and different number of biocatalytic units. Two mesh structures of each biocatalytic unit are used to sandwich immobilized CA while two floating units, connected on either side of the biocatalytic units, have an internal hollow volume that enables controlling the position of the enzyme-loaded interfacial device at or near the air-water interface. The positioning of interfacial device directly at the biphasic interface accelerated CO(2 )conversion by 1.8- and 3.4-fold when compared to reactions performed with immobilized CA within the aqueous solution and a control interfacial device without immobilized CA, respectively. The CA-loaded interfacial device retained 99.3 % and 88.2 % of its initial CO2 conversion rate after ten recycles and after subsequent storage in an aqueous buffer at 4 degrees C for 459 days, respectively. Facile combination of interfacial devices and immobilized enzymes on polymer fibers has paved the way to practical uses of biocatalysts for interfacial CO2 sequestration.

AB With the growing interest in sustainable manufacturing, 3D printing with recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) offers an innovative approach to upcycling waste. This study explores the potential of combining rPET with milled short carbon fibers and polymer chain extenders to produce high-performance 3D printing filaments through melt extrusion. Filaments containing 5% and 10% carbon fiber, with and without sizing, along with a polymer chain extender, were investigated to enhance viscosity and material properties of rPET. Thermal analysis techniques evaluated the material's thermal stability and transitions, assessing the degradation temperature and calorimetric properties including glass transition and melting temperatures, while the measured carbon fiber content closely matched the theoretical content. Tensile testing of unidirectionally printed samples showed promising mechanical properties. X-ray micro-computed tomography assessed fiber length in extruded filaments, comparing it with the target length set during manufacturing, showing agreement. Scanning electron microscopy examined fracture and side surfaces, revealing governing failure mechanisms and defects, attributed to filament production and composition. This study highlights the synergistic role of carbon fiber sizing and chain extenders in enhancing tensile modulus, while improving overall consistency and quality of extruded filaments. It presents a groundbreaking pathway for sustainable, high-performance additive manufacturing.Highlights Investigated the synergistic effect of CF sizing and chain extenders in rPET. Melt extrusion achieved 10% CF with excellent fiber alignment and integrity. Additives enhanced thermal stability, crystallization, and adhesion. SEM and Micro-CT revealed improved fiber-matrix bonding and fewer defects. Tensile modulus doubled through synergy of CF sizing and chain extenders.

AB Current photopolymers are mainly produced by (meth)acrylate-based photoresins, possessing permanently cross-linked structures that prohibit their chemical recycling. This study reports a one-step, scalable synthesis of dynamically cross-linked semicrystalline thiol-ene photopolymers comprising exchangeable disulfide bonds with excellent material performance, shape memory/adaptive characteristics, and chemical recyclability. These photopolymers are synthesized via stoichiometric thiol-ene click reactions using commercial reagents, including difunctional ene, alkyl dithiol giving rise to crystallinity, thiol-terminated oligomer comprising dynamic disulfide bonds, and trithiol cross-linker. Cross-link density is systematically controlled by varying trithiol cross-linker content to tune degrees of crystallinity and mechanical properties over a wide range, e.g., Young's modulus from 4 to 138 MPa, elongation-at-break from 40 to 370%, and toughness from 0.3 to 32 MJ m-3. Importantly, these dynamically cross-linked photopolymers undergo complete decross-linking via thiol-disulfide exchange reactions with small-molecule thiols at 120 degrees C in a solvent- and catalyst-free manner, yielding liquid thiol-terminated oligomers. These recycled thiol-terminated oligomers are used to synthesize next-generation dynamically cross-linked thiol-ene photopolymers with identical material composition and full property retention, demonstrating closed-loop recycling. Promisingly, these new thiol-ene photoresins demonstrate excellent feasibility for Digital Light Processing (DLP)-based 3D printing of high-resolution objects with complex geometries, preserved crystallinity and recyclability, and unique shape memory/adaptive characteristics.

AB Commercially dry cells are being used extensively both for domestic and industrial applications, and their disposal is also a challenge for solid waste management. Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) thermoplastic-based functional parts are also in high demand for electronic gadgets, touch screens, sensors, etc., and their recycling may help in urban mining. Significant studies have been reported on primary (1 degrees) and secondary (2 degrees) recycling of PVDF, but yet less has been testified on its tertiary (3 degrees) recycling. In this study, the 3 degrees recycling of PVDF was performed by reinforcing different chemicals/salts (graphite, MnO2, ZnCl2, and NH4Cl) recovered from waste dry cells used in domestic applications. The composition/proportion of different reinforcements in a 3 degrees recycled PVDF composite matrix was ascertained based on the melt flow index (MFI) for its possible 3D printing using fused filament fabrication (FFF). Finally, the mechanical and dielectric properties of 3 degrees recycled PVDF composites were observed based on X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The results suggest that the proposed 3 degrees recycled PVDF composite matrix may be used for sensing applications due to the formation of the beta phase.

AB The recycling of polymer composites remains a significant challenge due to both technical and economic obstacles. This study investigates the recycling potential of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) composites filled with carbon powder (CP), employing injection moulding and fused filament fabrication (FFF) technologies. Laboratory-based experiments were conducted using ABS reinforced with 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt.% CP to explore the tensile properties of mechanically recycled ABS+CP composites. The results indicate that CP addition positively influences tensile behaviour and that the ABS+CP composite maintains both tensile strength and stiffness after repeated processing. A concentration of 1.5 wt.% CP proved to be the optimal filler amount. The results for re-injection-moulded ABS + 1.5 wt.% CP demonstrate enhancements in tensile strength of approximately 3% and elastic modulus of approximately 15%, relative to virgin ABS. Similarly, such specimens reprocessed via FFF showed an average increase of 12% in tensile strength and of 27% in elastic modulus relative to virgin ABS across all three printing orientations (X, Y, and Z). These findings suggest improved interfacial adhesion and filler dispersion upon recycling. The study confirms the practical feasibility of ABS composite recycling and highlights their potential for structural and decorative use due to their appealing granite-like appearance.

AB Controlled design of low-cost, ecofriendly, and efficient metal recycling process of waste printed circuit boards (PCBs) is essential for sustainable industries. In this study, a metal extractor (ME) design was fabricated by anchoring organic chromophore chelate [(E)-4-((3-amino-4-hydroxyphenyl)diazenyl)naphthalen-1-ol (AHPDN)] into three-dimensional (3D) and vertical platelets of ZnO platforms to continuously extract and sensitively and selectively detect ultratrace Co2+ concentration (similar to 95.7%) in real e-waste leach liquor. Results reveal that the microscopic ZnO platelet hierarchy is successfully fabricated with nonstacked 3D platelet morphology through hydrothermal-assisted methodology. The 3D nonstacked ZnO platelets are oriented in horizontal and vertical domains, thereby enabling fabrication of potential ME for multidirectional diffusion and efficient adsorptivity of Co2+ ions. Multidiffusible, intermingled platelets and numerous active sites that decorated the ME hierarchy promote the ultratrace separation and recovery of Co2+ ions from PCBs. This scalable immobilization and accommodation of AHPDN along ZnO platelet surfaces effectively controls the Co2+ ion-recovery/extraction process. The selective adsorption of Co2+ ions in the presence of other competitive ions strongly depends on pH control assay. The consumed MEs can be repeatedly recycled, their platelet hierarchy and surface features are retained, and their selective adsorption functionalities are negligibly altered. Hierarchical MEs are suitable for the extraction of Co2+ from the waste PCBs.

AB This study explores a new energy partitioning approach to determine the fracture toughness of 3-D printed pristine/recycled high density polyethylene (HDPE) blends employing the essential work of fracture (EWF) concept. The traditional EWF approach conducts a uniaxial tensile test with double-edge notched tensile (DENT) specimens and measures the total energy defined by the area under a load-displacement curve until failure. The approach assumes that the entire total energy contributes to the fracture process only. This assumption is generally true for extruded polymers that fracture occurs in a material body. In contrast to the traditional extrusion manufacturing process, the current 3-D printing technique employs fused deposition modeling (FDM) that produces layer-by-layer structured specimens. This type of specimen tends to include separation energy even after the complete failure of specimens when the fracture test is conducted. The separation is not relevant to the fracture process, and the raw experimental data are likely to possess random variation or noise during fracture testing. Therefore, the current EWF approach may not be suitable for the fracture characterization of 3-D printed specimens. This paper proposed a new energy partitioning approach to exclude the irrelevant energy of the specimens caused by their intrinsic structural issues. The approach determined the energy partitioning location based on experimental data and observations. Results prove that the new approach provided more consistent results with a higher coefficient of correlation.

AB This paper introduces the integrated disassembly line balancing and routing problem with mobile additive manufacturing (I-DLB-RP-MAM). In the I-DLB-RP-MAM, end-of-life products are first disassembled in a single disassembly center, and a vehicle equipped with a 3D printer then dispatches both recycled and 3D printed components to the customers, i.e. remanufacturing centers. Several demanded components are obtained in disassembly center and the remaining amounts are produced by 3D printer en-route. We formulate a non-linear mathematical programming model for the I-DLB-RP-MAM. We conduct experiments on a numerical examplebased on a real product. Scenario analysis is conducted and results show that additive manufacturing technology can be successfully incorporated into the supply chain. We obtain significant improvements such as reduction in inventory and total cost.

AB In the past, significant studies have been reported on 3D-printed polypropylene (PP) for automotive dashboards, bumpers, etc. Also, previous studies have outlined the wear behaviour of PP (a hydrophobic thermoplastic material) in dry and wet conditions. However, little has been reported on secondary (2 degrees) recycling of PP with reinforcement of stubble waste powder (SWP) for possible use in automotive parts under different wear conditions. This study reports the 2 degrees recycling of PP blended with SWP followed by fused filament fabrication (FFF) of functional parts for wear analysis (under dry/wet conditions) for automotive components. The melt flow index (MFI) was used to ascertain the proportion of SWP by Vol (%) in the PP matrix as per ASTM-D1238. For analysis, PP- SWP 20% was selected to manufacture feedstock filament (of phi 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm) with MFI of 6.74 g/(10 min) using a single screw extruder (SSE) (at the barrel temperature 210 degrees C, screw speed 5 RPM) to fabricate the prototypes. The fabricated FFF prototypes were used for wear analysis using the pin-on-disc setup (as per the ASTM-G99) to ascertain the wear behaviour of the prepared PP-SWP composite. The result of this study suggests that the maximum wear rate (approximate to 133 mu m/min) in wet conditions was observed due to hydrolytic degradation under applied load. In contrast, the minimum wear rate (approximate to 49 mu m/min) was noticed under dry conditions. The results are supported by the morphological (scanning electron microscopy, porosity, grain size No.), thermal (differential scanning calorimetry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis.

AB Additive manufacturing of reactive metals has opened door to consider using metal 3D printing to manufacture aluminum alloys for different applications from automotive and aerospace to defense. However, one of the major milestones of adopting the technology is still the high price of metal powder in comparison to casting methods. Using recycled powder to additively manufacture parts can be considered one way to decrease the final price in this technology. In the present paper, the microstructural evolution and mechanical properties of the DMLS-AIS10Mg_200C alloy manufactured by recycled powder were investigated. As the first step of this research, the powder characteristics, i.e. morphology, average particle size, microstructure and composition, of virgin, condensate and recycled AlSi10Mg powder were studied. It was inferred that virgin and recycled powders had comparable powder characteristics, which are very different in comparison to the condensate powder. In the second step of this research, microstructural and mechanical characterization of the as-built DMLS-AlS10Mg_200C alloy using recycled powder revealed that elongation of horizontally built DMLS-AlSi10Mg_200C was higher compared to that of vertically built. In addition, the fracture surfaces of vertically and horizontally built samples were investigated and possible fracture modes discussed. It is confirmed that, the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the as-built as-built DMLS-AlS10Mg_200C manufactured by recycled powder were similar to that of virgin powder.

AB With ongoing miniaturization and weight reduction of portable electronic devices, effective heat dissipation is essential to inhibit malfunctions and premature failure. The application of fillers in a polymer matrix enhances the thermal conductivity of lightweight materials but impedes recyclability. All-polyethylene (all-PE) materials represent a sustainable and easy-to-recycle single-material alternative, whereby high and tunable thermal conductivity is provided by process-induced hierarchical PE nanostructures. Essential for this type of composite-free high-performance material is the specific PE composition containing high amounts of ultra-high molecular weight PE that form ultrastrong extended-chain nanostructures induced by shear and elongational flow during processing. This results in self-reinforcing fibre-like shish-kebab nanostructures with a high thermal conductivity parallel to the extended PE chains. Extrusion-based 3D printing enables tuning the orientation of the PE nanostructure to tailor the orientation and magnitude of the thermal conductivity. Thus, this material class highlights the possibility of combining digitally programmable heat management in 3D printed materials with sustainable material concepts.
   An all-polyethylene (PE) material that crystallizes into a hierarchical shish-kebab structure is introduced. The microstructure translates into a high and anisotropic thermal conductivity that can be controlled by fused-filament fabrication.

AB This study focused on material recycling of a biodegradable blend based on PLA and PHB for multiple applications of biodegradable polymeric material under real conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of multiple processing of a biodegradable polymer blend under the trade name NONOILEN (R), which was processed under laboratory as well as industrial conditions. In this article, we report on testing the effect of blending and multiple processing on thermomechanical stability, molecular characteristics, as well as thermophysical and mechanical properties of experimental- and industrial-type tested material suitable for FDM 3D technology. The results showed that the studied material degraded during blending and subsequently during multiple processing. Even after partial degradation, which was demonstrated by a decrease in average molecular weight and a decrease in complex viscosity in the process of multiple reprocessing, there was no significant change in the material's thermophysical properties, either in laboratory or industrial conditions. There was also no negative impact on the strength characteristics of multiple processed samples. The results of this work show that a biodegradable polymer blend based on PLA and PHB is a suitable candidate for material recycling even in industrial processing conditions. In addition, the results suggest that the biodegradable polymeric material NONOILEN (R) 3D 3056-2 is suitable for multiple uses in FDM technology.

AB Carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP) are already used in a wide range of applications such as automotive, aerospace and renewable energy industries and demand on this material class is increasing steadily. As demand increases, the amount of CFRP waste, either from production or at the end of life of components, increases simultaneously and sustainable solutions such as disposal, reuse or recycling of fiber reinforced materials getting more and more important. In this paper one possibility for recycling short carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 (CF/PA 6.6) is presented. The recycling process includes shredding of the material, drying and filament extrusion to enable a reuse of the material with an additive manufacturing process. The focus of this investigation is on the mechanical properties of the recycled filaments itself as well as on the 3D printed specimen considered recycled filaments. The properties at different stages of the short carbon fiber reinforced polyamide 6.6 recycling process were investigated, including the juvenile CF/PA 6.6 as well as specimens made from one- or two-times recycled material. Mechanical performance was evaluated by tensile, bending and impact testing. Experimental results pointed out that no significant difference in performance of juvenile and recycled materials was observed for tensile and flexural loads. The impact strength of the recycled specimen decreased to a small extent.

AB Recently, the health and environmental perspective of nano-materials has gained attention. Most previous work focused on Engineered Nanoparticles (ENP). This paper examines some recently introduced production routes in terms of generated nano-sized by-products. A discussion on the hazards of emitting such particles and fibers is included.
   Fine by-products were found in recycled metal powder after 3D printing by Selective Laser Melting (SLM). The process somehow generated small round metal particles (similar to 1-2 mu m) that are possibly carcinogenic and respirable, but not small enough to enter by skin-absorption. With preventive measures like closed handling and masks, any health related effects can be prevented.
   The composite manufacturing in particular generated ceramic and carbonaceous particles that are very small and respirable but do not appear to be intrinsically toxic. The smallest features in agglomerates were about 30 nm. Small particles and fibers that were not attached in agglomerates were found in a wide range of sizes, from 1 mu m and upwards. Preventive measures like closed handling and masks are strongly recommended.
   In contrast, the more traditional production route of fabric production is investigated. Here, brushing residue and recycled wool from fabric production contained few nano-sized by-products. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Green design and manufacturing process is one of the core of additive manufacturing technology, and excellent design and process are not only efficient, but also have high processing precision and high resource utilization. This work analyzes green design and manufacturing in additive manufacturing from four aspects, namely, printing materials, structural design, printing device optimization, and manufacturing process optimization. Regarding printing materials, it summarizes the commonly used categories, recyclability, and environmental impacts of different materials. In terms of structural design, the analysis highlights the advantages of additive manufacturing products and materials for lightweight applications. For printing device optimization, several efficient additive manufacturing products, materials, and equipment are evaluated based on green design and manufacturing principles. The research also investigates manufacturing process optimization by assessing the environmental effects of various additive manufacturing techniques. These findings provide valuable references and insights for promoting the widespread application of high-precision, resource-efficient printing technologies.

AB Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) has seen a rise in popularity for industrial and research applications due to freedom of design, comparably small costs and a short manufacturing time. However, the achievable surface quality and dimensional accuracy is still limited due to a hard to control and uncertain extrusion process. Thus, hybrid manufacturing offers the potential to improve the accuracy and roughness with subtractive manufacturing. Although several researchers have focused on recycling filament of defective prints, the recycling aspect of chips resulting from hybrid manufacturing did not receive the same attention. That is why in this work an initial step is taken for enabling an additional source for filament recycling by designing a chip collector. To optimize the capability of the system a systematic simulation-based design process is carried out. Particle trajectories obtained from high-speed video recordings were evaluated by means of particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). Subsequently two design concepts of an extraction hood were developed and analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Additionally, particle trajectories were calculated and evaluated. Based on the simulation results one flow optimized concept is chosen which offers a simulated chip extraction rate of 99.9 %. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI My lab's lighter footprint
SO SCIENCE

DT Editorial Material
AB I went into our lab meeting feeling dejected. For months, I had been trying to recycle some of our lab's plastic waste into 3D-printed lab tools, but it wasn't going well. "I've only been able to print three small items," I told my colleagues. They knew how committed I was to reducing the environmental footprint of our research. So one asked, "Maybe we should be thinking about how we can avoid having so much plastic waste in the first place?" Another chimed in: "Could we figure out how much energy we are consuming and how to reduce that?" Their questions buoyed my spirits-and led to a series of changes in how we operate in the lab.

ID COUPLING AGENT
AB This research aimed at developing composite filament for fuse deposition modeling (FDM) application was carried out by recycling post-used expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) as a binding matrix for natural fibers derived from corn husk (CH) waste. The recycled polystyrene (rPS) resin, CH fibers, and predefined amount of processing aid were primarily compounded using a Brabender (R) internal mixer to produce composite masterbatch feedstock. The composite masterbatch was further blended with measured amount of rPS resin, and the mixtures were extruded into composite filament containing different weight percentage (wt%) of CH fiber loading, ranging from 2.5 to 10 wt%. The 3D printability of the composite filament was assessed through observation on melt flow behavior and viscosity of the molten composite material subjected to typical FDM process conditions, where tensile dumbbell specimen was produced. Through repeated attempts carried out to FDM 3D-print the rPS/CH fiber filled composite filament, the result suggested that higher FDM extrusion percentage was required to produce quality part from composite filament with increase fiber content from 2.5 to 7.5 wt%. Composite filament with 10 wt% fiber loading failed to be printed due to premature thermal degradation and the slightly higher melt viscosity that tend to clog the printer nozzle.

AB During the manufacturing of thin-walled structures with fused deposition 3D printing, the build temperature often exhibits significant self-similarities due to the simple, quasi-repetitive nozzle path that controls the material deposition. However, such similarities or structured thermal patterns are less well-known and have been barely investigated. This study introduces three rules of temperature similarity in printing single-walled polymer parts: in-layer similarity, cross-layer similarity, and inter-layer time similarity. These rules have been observed in manufacturing processes with Biot numbers ranging from 0.03 to 0.3. Their forms, conditions, and rationales are explained in detail, followed by several practical applications, such as scaling up printing, obtaining gradient information from part cooling, and enabling easy setup for thermal monitoring. Notably, these rules establish a direct correlation between a single set of printing parameters-defining the material, geometry, and process conditions-and a spatially uniform bond quality. A new method for measuring the location-independent bond quality at a macro scale, based on sliding shear, is also presented. In a first case study in printing recycled poly(lactic acid) granules under forced convection, a bond strength of 24.8 MPa was obtained from the shear-induced peeling, compared to a z-direction tensile strength of 17.9 MPa.

   properties; printer development; ketoprofen
AB Binder jetting has the potential to revolutionize the way we produce medicine. However, tablets produced by binder jetting technology can be quite fragile and hard to handle. In this study, the printing process and ink composition were examined to optimize the mechanical properties of tablets. A model formulation containing the ketoprofen drug was developed and used as a base for optimization. Firstly, important printing parameters were identified with a fractional factorial design. Saturation and layer height critically influenced selected tablet properties. Relevant process parameters were optimized for tablet mechanical strength by using the D-optimization DoE approach. The best mechanical properties were achieved when saturation was set to 1 and layer height to 150 mu m. On the other hand, binder ink composition did not appear to impact tablet mechanical strength as much as process parameters did. Three ethanol-water mixtures were tested at three tablet strength levels and no definitive conclusions could be drawn. The binder jetting process can be wasteful, especially if the unbound powder cannot be reused. To determine the suitability of powder blend recycling, the ketoprofen content was measured for 27 subsequent batches of tablets. While the trendline did indicate a slight reduction in ketoprofen content, the powder blend reuse can nevertheless be employed.

ID ELECTROMECHANICAL PROPERTIES; NANOSIZED HYDROXYAPATITE
AB Utilization of biodegradable chicken bone extract, a biowaste,is presented for sustainable energy harvesting via a 3D-printed piezoelectricdevice for bone healing and biomedical applications.
   Animal waste, if not disposed of carefully, is a threatto theenvironment, as it may cause fouling and microorganism growth andcan be a home for many diseases. Hence, proper waste management isrequired. One such abundantly found biowaste product is chicken bones,which are thrown into nature after the meat is consumed. However,this biowaste (chicken bone extract, CBE) can be utilized to makebioceramics in an efficient way without much labor and cost. Bioceramicsmade from natural sources such as chicken bones have chemical, physical,and biological similarities to the inorganic content of human bonesand hence do not create any toxicity or harmful effects when usedinside the human body. Bone, being a piezoelectric material, makesthe healing of fractures faster (osteoconduction and osteoinduction)due to the electric field it generates. Hence, a piezoelectric devicefabricated from natural CBE could be utilized for generating piezoelectricityto heal bones. The piezoelectric behavior of a CBE bioceramic materialis studied for the first time by developing a device made via 3D printing.Piezoelectric studies were performed at various loads and tappingfrequencies, and a maximum piezoelectric coefficient (d (33)) of & SIM;68.7 pC/N and electromechanical couplingof 0.17 were obtained, which are suitable for piezoelectric energy-harvestingapplications. Normally, the lifetime of piezoelectric devices is low,and their disposal and recycling may also create health hazards. However,the current device made out of degradable natural CBE poses no environmentalthreat after disposal. This novel process opens up new opportunitiesand directions to rethink alternatives for piezoelectric materialsthat are used for sustainable energy harvesting.

AB Polyurethanes (PU) are emerging as pivotal material for future, owing to its exceptional versatility and adaptability across a myriad of industries. Its unique combination of properties, including flexibility, durability, versatility, positions it as a cornerstone for technological-advancements and sustainable-practices. These properties of polyurethanes make it ideal for applications in healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable technology. PU exhibits good resistance to chemicals and environmental conditions, which is beneficial for sensors operating in harsh environments. Sustainability is another crucial domain where polyurethane demonstrates substantial impact. Advances in recycling and the development of bio-based polyurethanes are fostering more eco-friendly manufacturing processes such as 3D printing. 3D printing, has become a valuable technique for creating cost-effective pathways for manufacturing crucial components in biomedical, wearable-technology, and defense-sectors using polymers. Additive manufacturing enables precise customization of sensor designs, improving their efficiency and effectiveness for specific applications whilst contributing to more sustainable production. This review provides a comprehensive study on usage of different additive manufacturing techniques for fabrication of polyurethane-based sensors. It includes a comparative analysis of various 3D printing techniques for fabricating these sensors, along with additives used with polyurethane to modify the properties of different sensor types, including strain sensors, capacitive sensors, and pressure sensors.

DT Article
ID MAINTENANCE; ELASTOMERS
AB Additive manufacturing of thermoplastics or metals is a well-approved sustainable process for obtaining rapidly precise and individual technical components. Except for crosslinked silicone rubber or thermoplastic elastomers, there is no method of additive manufacturing of elastomers. Based on the development of the additive manufacturing of elastomers (AME) process, the material group of rubber-based cured elastomers may gain first access to the process field of three-dimensional (3D) printing. Printing and crosslinking of rubber is separated into two steps. In the first step, printing is realized by extrusion of the rubber by using a twin-screw extruder, which works according to the derived fused-filament-fabrication principle. In the second step, the component is vulcanized in a high-pressure hot-air autoclave. Because of the plastic flow behavior of non-crosslinked rubber materials, a thermoplastic shell is probably needed to maintain the geometry and position of the additively manufactured rubber. In this way, one layer of thermoplastic and one layer of rubber are printed alternatingly until the component is finished. Afterward, the manufactured binary component is placed in an autoclave to obtain the elastomer after vulcanization under a hot-air and high-pressure atmosphere. Then, the thermoplastic shell is removed from the elastomer and can subsequently be recycled. As compared with conventional thermoplastics, the high viscosity of rubber during processing and its instable shape after extrusion are challenging factors in the development of the AME. This contribution will show a modified 3D printer; explain the printing process from the designed component, via shell generation, to the vulcanized component; and show first printed components.

AB Four biobased ester and ester-imine photocurable resins were formulated and evaluated for printability by digital light processing 3D printing. The resin formulations consisted of methacrylated eugenol alone or in combination with methacrylated poly(hydroxybutyrate)-oligomers and/or methacrylated vanillin-derived Schiff-base monomers. It was not possible to print methacrylated eugenol alone into coherent thermosets, likely due to the lower reactivity of the allyl-double bond. However, in combination with the other building blocks methacrylated eugenol improved the printability, although some over-curing phenomena were registered especially for the resins composed of methacrylated eugenol and methacrylated poly(hydroxybutyrate)-derived oligomers. The three formulations that were successfully printed to coherent thermosets were further evaluated for their solvent resistance, thermal and mechanical properties, reprocessability and biodegradability under simulated industrial composting conditions. The reprocessing experiments documented the synergic effect of ester and imine dynamic covalent bonds in favoring the preservation of the elastic modulus of the thermosets; while an evidently higher deterioration of the mechanical properties was registered for the ester-thermosets. The biodegradation studies highlighted a clear correlation between the biodegradation rate and the chemical structure of the thermosets, with the aliphatic components and ester and imine bonds increasing the thermosets' susceptibility to the biodegradation under simulated industrial composting conditions.

ID HIGH-DENSITY POLYETHYLENE
AB Recently, additive manufacturing (AM) techniques like 3D printing have emerged as a potentially game-changing example of digital manufacturing. However, high entry barriers of a tiny material library, different processing defects, and unpredictable product quality are still holding back its widespread use in the industry. Due to its remarkable success in data tasks like classification, regression, and clustering, machine learning (ML) has recently gained a great deal of interest in the subject of the material library. This paper examines the current state of ML applications in several key areas of AM, including polymer matrix composite materials and machine parameter optimization. Composite filaments have been extruded using Polylactic Acid (PLA) as it is a biodegradable material and shows how High-Density Poly Ethylene (HDPE) enhances physical strength. All the parameters for the filament extruder have been designed by machine learning. Thermal stability is a significant concern for polymers that have been overcome by introducing Titanium Dioxide nanoparticles. The microstructure, surface texture, electro-mechanical behavior, and other general features of extruded filaments made from recycled plastics have been investigated. The extrusion temperature, approximated using ML, is in excellent agreement with the surface texture and microstructure of the polymers, as confirmed by FESEM, EDX, and Particle analysis. Extruded filaments experienced 2500 Vs and confirmed their non-conductivity up to 77.7G Omega. Tensile strength and elongation at break, two measures of mechanical properties, have been examined. Incorporation of Titanium Dioxide Nanoparticles improved mechanical properties significantly. When it comes to 3D printing, the physical properties and potential uses of each composite material are different.

AB The iterative prototyping process for printed circuit boards (PCBs) frequently employs surface-mounted device (SMD) components, which are often discarded rather than reused due to the challenges associated with desoldering, leading to unnecessary electronic waste. This paper introduces SolderlessPCB, a collection of techniques for solder-free PCB prototyping, specifically designed to promote the recycling and reuse of electronic components. Central to this approach are custom 3D-printable housings that allow SMD components to be mounted onto PCBs without soldering. We detail the design of SolderlessPCB and the experiments conducted to evaluate its design parameters, electrical performance, and durability. To illustrate the potential for reusing SMD components with SolderlessPCB, we discuss two scenarios: the reuse of components from earlier design iterations and from obsolete prototypes. We also provide examples demonstrating that SolderlessPCB can handle high-current applications and is suitable for high-speed data transmission. The paper concludes by discussing the limitations of our approach and suggesting future directions to overcome these challenges.

TI Closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials
SO NATURE

DT Article
ID CHAIN; POLYOLEFINS; ACIDS; OILS
AB Plastics are key components of almost any technology today. Although their production consumes substantial feedstock resources, plastics are largely disposed of after their service life. In terms of a circular economy(1-8), reuse of post-consumer sorted polymers ('mechanical recycling') is hampered by deterioration of materials performance(9,10). Chemical recycling(1,11) via depolymerization to monomer offers an alternative that retains high-performance properties. The linear hydrocarbon chains of polyethylene(12) enable crystalline packing and provide excellent materials properties(13). Their inert nature hinders chemical recycling, however, necessitating temperatures above 600 degrees Celsius and recovering ethylene with a yield of less than 10 per cent(3,11,14). Here we show that renewable polycarbonates and polyesters with a low density of in-chain functional groups as break points in a polyethylene chain can be recycled chemically by solvolysis with a recovery rate of more than 96 per cent. At the same time, the break points do not disturb the crystalline polyethylene structure, and the desirable materials properties (like those of high-density polyethylene) are fully retained upon recycling. Processing can be performed by common injection moulding and the materials are well-suited for additive manufacturing, such as 3D printing. Selective removal from model polymer waste streams is possible. In our approach, the initial polymers result from polycondensation of long-chain building blocks, derived by state-of-the-art catalytic schemes from common plant oil feedstocks, or microalgae oils(15). This allows closed-loop recycling of polyethylene-like materials. Polycarbonates and polyesters with materials properties like those of high-density polyethylene can be recycled chemically by depolymerization to their constituent monomers, re-polymerization yielding material with uncompromised processing and materials properties.

AB Plastic packaging materials represent a new class of low-cost and sustainable additive manufacturing feedstocks. Recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has been shown to be a robust material for material extrusion additive manufacturing, with mechanical properties comparable with acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene. However, due to PET's high crystallinity, it is generally a brittle material and can be subject to premature fracture. It is well known that the addition of rubbers can serve to toughen PET. In this work, micronized rubber powder, as well as non-reactive and functionalized styrene-ethylene-butadiene-styrene (SEBS) elastomers were compounded with recycled PET. Tensile strength was not significantly affected, but toughness increased 85% with the addition of 5 wt% rubber, 350% with SEBS and over 550% with maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS compared to neat recycled PET. Fracture surface analysis revealed evidence of ductile fracture and cavitation in the rubber toughened samples. Published 2020.

AB Global warming and climate change have emerged as pressing issues closely associated with human activity and the manufacturing sector, significantly contributing to climate change. Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing (3DP), shows great promise as an alternative manufacturing method but raises concerns regarding plastic waste generation. To tackle this challenge, recycling polymer plastics and exploring natural waste materials for 3DP offer sustainable solutions. However, a comprehensive understanding of both aspects currently needs to be improved. This study aims to evaluate the current trends and advancements in sustainable biocomposites research, identify key topics and emerging areas of interest, investigate the recycling of waste materials for 3DP, assess commonly recycled polymer plastics, examine the thermomechanical properties of sustainable composites, and identify research gaps for future directions. The analysis involved collecting and evaluating 91 articles from the Scopus database. The findings underline the growing demand for sustainable approaches, the potential of recycled polymer plastics and natural waste materials, and the need to improve mechanical properties. Stakeholders are encouraged to adopt sustainable manufacturing practices and embrace circular economy models by utilizing recycled polymer composites and waste materials to produce biodegradable polymer composites. Future research should explore advanced 3DP methods to enhance mechanical properties, thereby contributing to sustainable manufacturing practices and addressing the challenges of climate change.

AB To advance the capabilities of additive manufacturing, novel resin formulations are needed that produce high-fidelity parts with desired mechanical properties that are also amenable to recycling. In this work, a thiol-ene-based system incorporating semicrystallinity and dynamic thioester bonds within polymer networks is presented. It is shown that these materials have ultimate toughness values >16 MJ cm(-3), comparable to high-performance literature precedents. Significantly, the treatment of these networks with excess thiols facilitates thiol-thioester exchange that degrades polymerized networks into functional oligomers. These oligomers are shown to be amenable to repolymerization into constructs with varying thermomechanical properties, including elastomeric networks that recover their shape fully from >100% strain. Using a commercial stereolithographic printer, these resin formulations are printed into functional objects including both stiff (E similar to 10-100 MPa) and soft (E similar to 1-10 MPa) lattice structures. Finally, it is shown that the incorporation of both dynamic chemistry and crystallinity further enables advancement in the properties and characteristics of printed parts, including attributes such as self-healing and shape-memory.

AB The increasing adoption of distributed recycling via additive manufacturing (DRAM) has facilitated the revalorization of materials derived from waste streams for additive manufacturing. Recycled materials frequently contain impurities and mixed polymers, which can degrade their properties over multiple cycles. This degradation, particularly in rheological properties, limits their applicability in 3D printing. Consequently, there is a critical need for a tool that enables the rapid assessment of the flowability of these recycled materials. This study presents the design, development, and manufacturing of an open-source melt flow index (MFI) apparatus. The open-source MFI was validated with tests on virgin polylactic acid pellets, shredded recycled poly(ethylene) terephthalate glycol flakes, and high-density polyethylene/poly(ethylene) terephthalate blends to demonstrate the range of polymer types and recyclability. The proposed MFI tool offers a user-friendly and cost-effective solution for evaluating the flow properties of materials from waste streams, thereby enhancing their viability for additive manufacturing applications.

AB Solar technologies constitute an excellent alternative for water treatment in low-income countries where the poverty of a large part of the population hinders their access to safe water. From a technical point of view, the use of compound parabolic collectors (CPC) has been consolidated in the last decades. However, the relatively high cost of tooling conventional manufacturing processes for these collectors makes them difficult to afford in the most impoverished regions. This work presents the development of low-cost CPC and parabolic through solar collectors (PTC) by 3D printing of the structure and the use of recycled reflective materials. Besides, open-source hardware has been used to control system operation, including a supplementary UV LED system to compensate for the operation under low solar irradiance. Regarding the tested reflective materials, an optimum is obtained using an aluminium adhesive sheet that leads to an efficiency of 80% compared to a commercial CPC made of high-quality anodised aluminium, being the cost 20 times lower. On the other hand, incorporating a low-cost solar tracking system in a printed PTC reactor could lead to efficiencies up to 300% compared to the commercial CPC, while the cost was 4.5 times lower. Finally, the LED compensation system was successfully validated, allowing the operation with a constant treatment capacity during operation in cloudy conditions. In conclusion, the developed collectors are high-performance solar water treatment systems with a significantly lower investment cost, making them affordable worldwide.

The aim of this study was to indicate the state and directions of development of the technology of geometric recycling of polymer powders in 3D additive manufacturing, the need to control the geometric quality of the powders, and the quality of the design of machines for their processing in a closed circuit. The method was aimed at creating a strategy and verifying the stages of development of a new idea for stabilizing the geometric and dynamic design features of polymer powders for additive manufacturing (3D printing).

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is the most common additive manufacturing system that is increasingly used for industrial and consumer applications. These systems selectively extrude/deposit polymers to manufacture parts directly from computational designs. Therefore, FDM enables conversion of recycled thermoplastic polymers to higher quality products. However, FDM induces porosity, which reduces mechanical performance and causes variations in mechanical properties of fused deposition modeled (FDMed) polymers. A safe and reliable use of FDMed-recycled polymers demands a better understanding of the effect of recycling on the mechanical properties. In this study, we investigated the effect of three rounds of recycling on the stochastic mechanical properties of FDMed ABS. A total of 337 tensile tests were performed on FDMed virgin and recycled ABS. Recycling increased the porosity of FDMed ABS from similar to 11 vol% to similar to 17 vol %. The tensile and fracture strength decreased by similar to 10%. The strain at break decreased by 25% from 5.2% to 3.9%, causing a decrease in toughness by 37%. We observed significant variations in the mechanical properties, which were analyzed using Weibull statistics. An S-type deviation from Weibull distribution was observed for strength variations that was related to porosity. Minimal degradation in ABS molecular structure was observed via gel permeation chromatography, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy revealed an increase in elemental iron with recycling. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies enable the production of customized and personalized medical devices that facilitate users' comfort and rehabilitation requirements according to their individual conditions. The concept of a tailor-made orthopedic device addresses the accelerated recovery and comfort of the patient through the utilization of personalized rehabilitation equipment. Direct modeling, with an increasing number of approaches and prototypes, has provided many successful results until now. The modeling procedure for 3D-printed orthoses has emerged as the execution of steady and continuous tasks with several design selection criteria, such as cutting, thickening the surface, and engraving the shell of the orthosis. This publication takes into consideration the aforementioned criteria and proposes the creation of a holistic methodology and automated computational design process for the customization of orthotic assistive devices, considering aspects such as material properties, manufacturing limitations, recycling, and patients' requirements. This proposal leads to the designing and manufacturing of a wrist orthopedic device based on reverse engineering, Design for AM (DfAM), and Design for Recycling (DfR) principles. The proposed methodology can be adjusted for different limbs. A dual-material approach was attained utilizing rigid, mechanically enhanced feedstock material and soft elastic material with reduced skin irritation risks to achieve both mechanical requirements and adequate cushioning for user comfort during rehabilitation. Recyclable thermoplastic matrices were selected, which also allow for the option to create washable devices for product life extension. Then, 3D scanning procedures were implemented to acquire the initial anatomic measurements for the design of the WHO and ensure and assess the dimensional accuracy of the final product. Physical mechanical testing was implemented to evaluate the WHO's mechanical behavior and verify its functionality during basic wrist movements. The extracted dimensional data for the two main orthosis components that indicated approximately 50% and 25% of the tolerance values, respectively, were within the range (-0.1 mm, 0.1 mm).

AB This study substituted sludge incineration slag for natural sand in the application of 3D printed concrete technology (3DCP). It analyzed the influence of the sludge incineration slag incorporation on the workability, printability, mechanical properties, and the solidifying effect of heavy metals in 3DCP. Furthermore, the environmental and economic benefits were also examined. The results indicated that the incorporation of sludge incineration slag accelerated the loss of workability factors such as flowability and consistency in 3DCP. However, it significantly enhanced the early strength of 3DCP and improved its buildability. Additionally, the addition of sludge incineration slag diminished the mechanical properties of 3DCP. When the substitution rate reached 50 % of natural sand with sludge incineration slag, the strength of the 3D printed specimens decreased by 22.1 %. Experimental investigations at a micro-scale indicated that the porosity of interlayer interfaces was a crucial factor causing strength reduction and could be ameliorated by appropriately increasing the extrusion amount to address excessive pore sizes. Toxicity leaching tests for heavy metals demonstrated that the maximum heavy metal leaching concentration in 3DCP specimens with sludge incineration slag incorporation was 0.14 mg/ L, meeting the specified requirements. The 3DCP with sludge incineration slag incorporation not only addressed the difficulty in handling incineration bottom slag but also conserved natural sand resources, presenting outstanding environmental and economic benefits. For instance, by substituting 100 % natural sand with sludge incineration slag, there were 5 % reduction in carbon emissions and 30 % increase in economic benefits.

AB Wind energy is one of the most important clean energy sources. However, the manufacturing processes of turbine blades require rethinking when considering circular economy concepts. Rebuilt blades could be made with solid waste from the same turbines after their life cycle or from residual parts from other processes. The most direct adverse environmental effect is in the recycling of the wind turbines blades, since thermoset materials are the most typical material for the blades, which are not easily recycled at the end of their life cycle, worsen by the fibers that typically it contents in the blades. This research seeks to evaluate the mechanical strength of two types of thermoplastic materials, PLA and PETG, manufactured in a 3D printer. The PTEG material exhibited the most desirable mechanical strengths and will be the one used to manufacture the blades of an H-Darrieus wind turbine on a laboratory scale.

ID MICROGELS
AB Spherical microgels can be conveniently direct ink written into granular hydrogels because of their rheological properties when jammed. Yet, due to weak interparticle interactions, the resulting granular hydrogels are soft and often disassemble if immersed in aqueous media. These shortcomings can be addressed if microgels are firmly connected, for example through inter-particle covalent bonds or by introducing a second hydrogel network that interpenetrates the microgels and covalently connects them. However, these techniques typically hamper the recycling of the granular system. Here, electrostatic attraction forces between microgels and a polyelectrolyte are explored to directly print charged microgels into free standing structures in aqueous media. The resulting granular system remains stable in aqueous media for at least one month and can be recycled with minimal energy input.

AB The refining effect of electron beam melting (EBM) during the additive manufacturing of Ti products was studied by comparing unused Grade-2 commercially pure (CP) Ti powder to an equivalent powder that had been recycled 50 times. The pre-heating and blasting processes that occur during recycling were found to degrade the perfectly spherical morphology of the powder, and the concentration of O and N were also increased by about 15%. This resulted in it changing to a Grade-3 CP Ti powder; however, the purity of the final product was improved to Grade-1 CP Ti by the slight refining effect of the EBM process.

DE Circular economy; Additive manufacturing; Textile recycling
AB According to the Brazilian Association of the Apparel and Textile Industry (ABIT) [Associacao Brasileira da Industria Textil e de Vestuario], Brazil is world leader in the production of beachwear, and the state of Rio de Janeiro is the largest producer of this segment in the country. In the cutting process of these models, approximately 30% waste of raw material, most of which is discarded in sanitary landfills. In order to transform the textile waste into a new value-added material, this paper addresses the initial results of a filament prototype for 3D printers, using pre-consumer polyamide mesh waste from the production of beachwear. As theoretical support we discuss the circular economy and circular fashion concepts, additive manufacturing and textile recycling. One solution proposes to use this filament in printing trims and accessories on demand and or customized, to replenish their production.

AB Compared with conventional reactors that are designed by traditional micromachining technology, the use of 3D-printing technology to manufacture multichannel large-volume microchannel reactors as reaction equipment to remove low-concentration NOX by the wet method is simple and convenient, and the processing cost is low. The results showed that when the concentration of NO was 400 ppm, the mixed solution of (NH2)(2)CO mass fraction of 3% and H2O2 concentration of 0.5 mol/L was used, and the flow rates of gas and liquid were 100 mL/min, respectively, under the experimental conditions of pH = 11, solution temperature of 20 degrees C and 500 mL solution recycling for 20 min, the best removal effect of NOX was achieved, and the removal efficiency was 100%. When the O-2 content in the flue gas was increased and the number and length of microchannels were increased, the NOX removal efficiency increased accordingly, which was conducive to the rapid and efficient reaction. The application of the microchannel reactor presents a new method for improving the air quality and reducing environmental pollution in the future.

DE Polyetherimide; Hybrid composites; Fused filament fabrication 3D

AB The study aims to develop novel polyetherimide (PEI) composite formulations by the incorporation of recycled carbon fibers (rCFs), thermal black (TB) particles, and the combination of rCF/TB hybrids. Thermoplastic composites were prepared by melt compounding of an amorphous PEI, rCFs, and TB particles. Four (4) formulations of composites were prepared, with a maximum loading of 20 wt% of rCF and a gradual replacement of rCF by TB. These formulations were used to manufacture standard specimens through injection molding (IM) and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) after being extruded into filaments. The effect of rCF and TB contents on the mechanical performance, the thermal behaviour, and on the microstructure of injected and FFF printed specimens were evaluated and analyzed. Incorporating 20 wt% rCF increased the tensile modulus of IM specimens from 3.2 GPa to 6.2 GPa, while tensile strength improved from 74 MPa to 103 MPa. FFF printed composite specimens with 20 wt% of rCF presented a tensile modulus of 4.3 GPa and a tensile strength of 70 MPa, respectively. The heat deflection temperature (HDT) of the IM and FFF printed composite increased from 177 degrees C to 200 degrees C with the addition of 20 wt% of rCF, a common metric for assessing the maximum service temperature. X-ray micro-tomography was carried out to assess the composites' porosity contents and, as well, the rCF average legth and orientations. X-ray micro-tomography results illustrated that the presence of rCF led to a maximum porosity formation of up to 17 % in the FFF printed specimens. As expected, the initial length of the raw rCF was reduced from 6 mm down to approximately 30 mu m mainly due to the shear forces applied during the different steps of the manufacturing process, i.e., composites compounding, filament extrusion, and FFF printing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images obtained on fractured surfaces revealed that the incorporation of TB seemed to improve the fiber matrix adhesion when compared to composites containing only rCF. The obtained results allowed us to understand the thermal and mechanical performance of these novel composites and their potential for FFF 3D printing of parts for aircraft interior or ground transportation applications.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), shows promising advancements in layer-based modeling displaying its potential for substantial waste reduction. Out of all the AM methods, the most cost-effective and popular choice for prototyping and making customized parts is fused deposition modeling (FDM). This research investigates how various FDM process parameters specifically layer thickness, raster angle, and printing speed affect the mechanical properties of 3D-printed PETG (polyethylene terephthalate glycol) specimens reinforced with carbon fiber (CF). Optimal settings, including a 0 degrees raster angle, 0.2 mm layer thickness, and 40 mm/s printing speed, enhance both tensile and flexural strength due to improvement in material bonding and alignment. Interestingly, lower values for raster angle, layer thickness, and printing speed also lead to notable improvements in mechanical properties. Contour and interaction plots provide valuable insights into the significant impact of these parameters. The study also explores how different printing speeds influence the mechanical characteristics of CFreinforced PETG specimens. Furthermore, the comparative analysis demonstrated that incorporating carbon fiber into recycled PET waste materials resulted in an approximately 30% increase in tensile strength. These findings imply that using CF with plastic waste in large-scale industries can pave the way for innovative solutions, enhancing performance and sustainability, especially in the automotive, and defence sectors.

AB Due exceptional properties such as its high-temperature resistance, mechanical characteristics, and relatively lower price, the demand for carbon fiber has been increasing over the past years. The widespread use of carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers or plastics (CFRP) has attracted many industries. However, on the other hand, the increasing demand for carbon fibers has created a waste recycling problem that must be overcome. In this context, increasing plastic waste from the new 3D printing technology has been increased, contributing to a greater need for recycling efforts. This research aims to produce a recycled composite made from different carbon fiber leftover resources to reinforce the increasing waste of Polylactic acid (PLA) as a promising solution to the growing demand for both materials. Two types of leftover carbon fiber waste from domestic industries are handled: carbon fiber waste (CF) and carbon fiber-reinforced composite (CFRP). Two strategies are adopted to produce the recycled composite material, mixing PLA waste with CF one time and with CFRP the second time. The recycled composites are tested under tensile test conditions to investigate the impact of the waste carbon reinforcement on PLA properties. Additionally, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is carried out on composites to study their thermal properties.

AB Engineering microfluidic devices relies on the ability to manufacture sub-100 micrometer fluidic channels. Conventional lithographic methods provide high resolution but require costly exposure tools and outsourcing of masks, which extends the turnaround time to several days. The desire to accelerate design/test cycles has motivated the rapid prototyping of microfluidic channels; however, many of these methods (e.g., laser cutters, craft cutters, fused deposition modeling) have feature sizes of several hundred microns or more. In this paper, we describe a 1-day process for fabricating sub-100 mu m channels, leveraging a low-cost (USD 600) 8K digital light projection (DLP) 3D resin printer. The soft lithography process includes mold printing, post-treatment, and casting polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomer. The process can produce microchannels with 44 mu m lateral resolution and 25 mu m height, posts as small as 400 mu m, aspect ratio up to 7, structures with varying z-height, integrated reservoirs for fluidic connections, and a built-in tray for casting. We discuss strategies to obtain reliable structures, prevent mold warpage, facilitate curing and removal of PDMS during molding, and recycle the solvents used in the process. To our knowledge, this is the first low-cost 3D printer that prints extruded structures that can mold sub-100 mu m channels, providing a balance between resolution, turnaround time, and cost (similar to USD 5 for a 2 x 5 x 0.5 cm(3) chip) that will be attractive for many microfluidics labs.

AB Adsorption is considered to be one of the most effective and economically viable technologies for removing contaminants from the environment. However, the disadvantages of its high-cost complicated process and difficulty in efficient recycling limit its practical application. Herein, a thermoplastic elastomer-polyvinyl alcohol composite (LAY-FOMM 60) sponge three-dimensional structure (3D printing sponge) was fabricated by the fused filament fabrication combined with water erosion technique. The size and shape of the resultant sponge were tailored, and the batch of adsorption/desorption experiments of Rhodamine B (RhB) onto the sponge was performed. The results show that the adsorption of RhB on the 3D printing sponge was mainly via physical adsorption, and pseudo-second-order and Langmuir models exhibited good correlation with the adsorption kinetic and isotherm data, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters suggest that the adsorption is an endothermic and spontaneous process. It is worth to note that the adsorption/desorption efficiency can be raised by compression. This results in high efficiency and low cost for adsorption/desorption process and benefit for regeneration of the adsorbent. The adsorption capacity was maintained over 85% of the initial capacity after being used for five cycles. The approach provides a simple strategy for manufacturing customizable porous adsorbent materials that meet various water treatment requirements.

AB Continuous carbon fiber (cCF)-based 3D-printed polymer composites are known for their excellent flexural properties; however, the optimization of the overall process is still desired, depending on the material types involved. Here, the improved manufacturing of cCF-based composites is reported, considering virgin polyamide (PA) and postindustrial waste polypropylene (PP), and the parameters affecting the material properties are evaluated. Firstly, the prepregnation technique was optimized to manufacture cCF polymer filaments with various fiber-to-polymer ratios. Secondly, the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique was optimized. It was observed that the layer height needs to be sufficiently low for proper interlayer adhesion. The influence of the printing temperature is more complicated, with filaments characterized by a lower fiber-to-polymer ratio requiring a higher nozzle diameter and higher temperatures for efficient printing; and for lower diameters, the best flexural properties are observed for parts printed at lower temperatures, maintaining a high interspace distance. Plasma treatment of the cCF was also explored, as was annealing of the produced parts to enhance the flexural properties, the latter being specifically interesting for the PP-based composite due to a lower wetting caused by a higher viscosity, despite supportive interfacial interactions. Eventually, overall guidelines were formulated for the successful production of cCF-based composites.

AB Chitin, as one of the most abundant biopolymers in the world, has promising applications in various fields. However, critical challenges still remain in the extraction and value-added utilization of chitin in a cost-effective and environmentally-friendly manner. Herein, a time-saving, energy-efficient, and sustainable strategy consisting of microwave heating and deep eutectic solvents (DESs) treatment is demonstrated to extract the chitin from the crayfish shells. Benefitted from the release of hydrogen ion from acidic hydrogen bond donor of DESs and the formation of hydrogen bonding between DES components and protein, the minerals and protein are successfully removed using the choline chloride/lactic acid (CL) DESs. With the optimized extraction conditions, the high yield and purity of chitin is simultaneously obtained as 19.11% and 97.44%, respectively. Furthermore, the DESs can be recycled and reused for 4 times with ease, which is conductive to reducing the extraction cost and realizing the sustainable development. Finally, the extracted chitin can be further dissolved in DESs to prepare a viscoelastic ink, which displays superior rheological properties and 3D printability. This study provides a green and facile method for chitin production and opens an exciting avenue for the high value-added utilization of chitin as 3D printing ink.

AB In recent years, emerging contaminants in water, such as pesticides and pharmaceuticals, have gained significant attention, underscoring the need for innovative purification and monitoring solutions. Diclofenac, a widely used nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, has become an important environmental contaminant due to its widespread use and the poor efficiency of conventional wastewater treatment systems. This study focuses on the development of an innovative all-in-one 3D printed device for small-scale monitoring and remediation of emerging contaminants such as diclofenac, with the potential to be adapted to others as well. The main novelty of this work lies in the design of a compact and portable platform that not only enables the detection of diclofenac in real time but also assesses the quality of its remediation. The 3D-printed device integrates a flexible, screenprinted sensor on a polyester substrate for diclofenac detection, along with recycled cellulose acetate particles functionalized with activated carbon (20 % w/w) as the remediation material. Combining electrochemical sensing technologies with a lightweight and cost-effective three-dimensional configuration, the platform offers a highly efficient and easy-to-use solution for monitoring and optimizing remediation processes. The device provides real-time feedback on diclofenac concentrations, evaluating remediation efficiency under practical, realworld conditions. Results showed that the all-in-one platform achieved a detection limit for diclofenac of 0.1 mu M and demonstrated a remediation efficiency of about 53 %. This innovative 3D system represents a significant advance in the industry, offering a versatile and scalable solution to improve the management of pharmaceutical contaminants in water resources, with broader applications for various emerging pollutants.

AB The versatility of additive manufacturing (AM) in producing components of various sizes and geometries has positioned it as a pivotal subject of exploration across both research and industry. Among the diverse three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques, stereolithography (SLA) has garnered substantial attention. Renowned for its precision and the impeccably smooth finish it imparts to specimens, SLA has found prominence; however, its utility has traditionally been limited to crafting diminutive pieces. Challenges such as cost, fragility, and recycling intricacies further compound its application. This study introduces a joining approach for printed parts to tackle the challenge of creating larger samples using small-scale SLA printers. Furthermore, the proposed method provides a potential solution for repairing damaged samples, fostering sample reutilization and cost-efficiency. The choice of clear resin was pivotal in this regard. Comprehensive mechanical, chemical, and thermophysical analyses were conducted to discern the properties of samples produced via both the conventional and the joining methods. Encouragingly, the results point to the commendable performance of the samples fabricated using this approach, signifying its viability.

AB Lattice structure design widely applicable for 3D printed components. This research investigated the lattice structure with different shape and relative density using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulation. The material used for the lattice structure was the recycled polystyrene made from post-used Styrofoam. The research assessed the mechanical behaviour of lattice structure with either triangular prism and square prism with FEA simulation and numerical mathematical modelling, such as stiffness to-mass ratio, maximum von Misses stress and effective Young's modulus. The finding FEA shows a good agreement with result from numerical mathematic modelling. The FEA results show lattice structure with triangular prism exhibited lowest value of maximum von Misses stress with maximum stiffness-to-mass value compared to lattice structure square prism. The finding from this work provided an early prediction on mechanical properties of lattice structure fabricated from recycled polystyrene.

AB The improper disposal of discarded electronic and electrical equipment raises environmental and health concerns, spanning air pollution to water and soil contamination, underscoring the imperative for responsible management practises. This review explores the complex composition of discarded printed circuit boards (DPCBs), crucial components in electronic devices. Comprising substrates, electronic elements and solder, DPCBs showcase a heterogeneous structure with metal (30.0-50.0%) and non-metal (50.0-70.0%) fractions. Notably abundant in precious metals such as Au, Ag, and Pd, DPCBs offer a compelling avenue for recycling initiatives. The inclusion of heavy metals and flame retardants adds complexity, necessitating environmentally sound disposal methods. Ongoing research on smart disassembly, utilising 3D image recognition technology, underscores the importance of accurate identification and positioning of electronic components (ECs). The targeted approach of smart disassembly, centred on valuable components, highlights its significance, albeit with challenges in equipment costs and capacity limitations. In mechanical disassembly, techniques such as grinding and heat application are employed to extract ECs, with innovations addressing gas emissions and damage induced by overheating. Chemical disassembly methods, encompassing epoxy resin delamination and tin removal, present promising recovery options, whilst the integration of chemical and electrochemical processes shows potential. Efficient sorting, encompassing both manual and automated methods, is imperative post-disassembly, with smart sorting technologies augmenting accuracy in the identification and categorisation of ECs. In addition, explorations into NH3/NH4+ solutions for selective metal recovery underscore challenges and stress the necessity for meticulous process optimisation in environmentally sustainable PCB recycling. Challenges and future perspectives have also been expounded.

AB Polyimides with ultralow dielectric permittivity and loss are essential for the production of advanced highfrequency wireless telecommunications systems. However, most polyimides produced through one-step hightemperature imidization and molding are thermosetting and incompatible with microelectronics manufacturing. Herein, we develop a vapor induced phase separation (VIPS) assisted direct ink writing process for the roomtemperature fabrication of three-dimensional (3D) polyimide dielectrics. A simple yet effective ink formulation composed exclusively of soluble polyimide (sPI) and solvents is presented. Upon extrusion, the ink undergoes rapid gelation and solidification via VIPS triggered by ambient moisture, followed by solvent exchange in liquid water to form sPI filaments with dense skins and microporous cores. By programmably adjusting nozzle trajectories, the macroscopic features of the filaments can be precisely controlled, enabling the fabrication of 3D sPI dielectrics with a porosity of up to 87 %. These materials exhibit an ultralow permittivity of 1.32 and a loss tangent of 0.005 at 1 MHz, surpassing the performance of many existing dielectrics. The 3D dielectrics are applied in the fabrication of coplanar waveguide antennas and thermal management systems, demonstrating their potential for high-frequency communication and advanced electronics. Furthermore, the 3D sPI prints can be fully recycled by dissolving the products in solvents and reprocessing them into new ultralow-permittivity dielectrics, offering a sustainable and low-carbon manufacturing strategy for the microelectronics industry. This work not only overcomes the limitations of traditional polyimide processing but also provides a new platform for next-generation high-frequency communication and electronic devices.

AB Carbon materials are essential to the development of modern society with indispensable use in various applications, such as energy storage and high-performance composites. Despite great progress, on-demand carbon manufacturing with control over 3D macroscopic configuration is still an intractable challenge, hindering their direct use in many areas requiring structured materials and products. This work introduces a simple and scalable method to generate complex, large-scale carbon structures using easily accessible materials and technologies. 3D-printed, commercial polypropylene (PP) parts can be thermally stabilized through cracking-facilitated diffusion and crosslinking. The newly elucidated mechanism from this work allows thick PP parts to yield carbonaceous products with complex structures through a subsequent pyrolysis step. The approach for enabling PP-to-carbon conversion has consistent product yield and controlled dimensional shrinkage. Under optimized processing conditions, these PP-derived carbons exhibit robust mechanical properties and excellent joule heating performance, demonstrated by their versatile use as heating elements. Furthermore, this process can be extended to recycled PP, enabling the conversion of waste plastic materials to value-added products. This work provides an innovative approach to create structured carbon materials with direct access to complex geometry, which can be transformative to, and broadly benefit, many important technological applications.

AB Recycling rigid polyurethane (PU) waste remains a challenge due to its complex chemical structure and non-biodegradability. This study introduces a novel approach to recycling rigid PU by incorporating it into polylactic acid (PLA) to create composite filaments compatible with fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. The mechanical (tensile and flexural) and acoustic properties of the printed samples were systematically evaluated through experimental analysis and validated via simulations. The 3 wt.% rigid PU-PLA composites exhibited the highest mechanical strength, with a 10.3 % increase in ultimate tensile strength (32 N/mm(2)) compared to pristine PLA (29 N/mm(2)). The flexural strength peaked at 55 N/mm(2) at 3.7 % strain for the 3 wt.% rigid PU sample. While higher rigid PU content (>3 wt.%) led to mechanical performance degradation due to particle agglomeration and reduced interfacial adhesion, the 6 wt.% rigid PU composite exhibited the highest acoustic performance, achieving a maximum absorption coefficient (alpha = 0.35 at 1350 Hz) and sound pressure level (SPL) reductions of 30-55 dB. High-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provided insights into the composite's morphology, chemical interactions, and thermal stability. This work presents a sustainable strategy for rigid PU waste recycling, improving both the mechanical strength and acoustic properties of PLA composites to be used in high-performance engineering applications.

ID ELECTRODES
AB The development of a print-at-home, low-cost, and miniaturized paper-based cell with 3D-printed electrodes using a 3D-printing pen and a bespoke conductive filament for detecting capsaicin in hot sauce is reported herein. The material cost of producing each electrode was less than 0.01 pound. The new filament was electrochemically benchmarked against a commercial CB/PLA conductive filament. The CB/graphite/recycled PLA filament molded in paper platform produced a heterogeneous rate constant, k0obs, of 1.64 (+/- 0.13) x 10-3 cm s-1 and resistance of only 166 +/- 0.13 Omega compared to 0.43 (+/- 0.05) x 10-3 cm s-1 and 1613 +/- 220 Omega for an identical device printed from commercial CB/PLA filament. The newly developed device using the bespoke filament on kraft paper was applied successfully to detect capsaicin (CAP). CAP showed a characteristic peak at approximately +0.7 V for the bespoke CB/graphite/rPLA filament in cyclic voltammetry. A small peak at +1.0 V is observed when using the commercial filament. Additionally, a linear range of 5 to 20 mu M and a sensitivity of 0.0093 mu A mu M was obtained for CAP when applying differential pulse voltammetry using the paper-based device with the bespoke filament. Limits of detection and quantification were calculated at 1.21 and 3.98 mu M, respectively. The new system quantifies CAP in a commercial red pepper hot sauce (Tabasco). This work highlights how a low-cost kraft paper platform and a bespoke conductive filament can be combined to create an effective electrochemical device using simple tools for quantifying capsaicin in real samples. Additionally, it highlights the potential of these materials and techniques to develop home-based sensors.

AB Most prior studies in the field of Distributed Recycling Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) have focused on utilizing recycle-bots-waste plastic extruders-to produce feedstock for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). This work introduces and rigorously assesses an innovative, energy-efficient recycling technique specifically developed for post-consumer PET sourced from water bottles, bypassing conventional extrusion-based filament production. The proposed approach enables the direct fabrication of high-quality PET filament, with comprehensive material characterization performed at each stage: raw material, filament, and 3D-printed specimens. Results indicate that the recycling process effectively preserves the semi-crystalline nature of PET (approximately 30% crystallinity) and maintains a high glass transition temperature (75-82 degrees C), while significantly minimizing thermal degradation. Key FFF process parameters-including infill density, printing speed, and layer thickness-were systematically optimized using the Taguchi method coupled with Grey Relational Analysis (GRA), aiming to simultaneously maximize mechanical performance (Young's modulus and tensile strength) and minimize production time and material consumption. Under optimized conditions, virgin PET exhibited a Young's modulus of 3670 MPa and a tensile strength of 45 MPa, while recycled PET achieved 2311 MPa and 30 MPa, respectively. Despite the performance gap-attributed primarily to partial crystallinity loss during reprocessing-the mechanical properties of recycled PET remain competitive with those of commonly used thermoplastics, such as PLA. Furthermore, the low prediction errors (< 5%) between experimental and GRA-forecasted responses confirm the robustness of the adopted multi-objective optimization framework. This study underscores the viability of using directly recycled PET as a sustainable and efficient alternative material in FFF, offering both environmental and functional benefits for structural applications.

AB The sustainability of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) is often compromised by the high cement content required to meet printability standards. This study investigates using recycled municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) bottom ash as a partial cement substitute to develop concrete with the required rheological and hardening properties for 3DCP, thereby addressing this challenge. The effects of incorporating 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % MSWI bottom ash on the fresh and hardened properties were examined. The shear stress, yield stresses, structuration rate, flowability, setting time, and open time were evaluated in the fresh state. At the hardened state, microstructural evolution and mechanical strengths were analyzed at various curing ages. The findings reveal that 10 % and 20 % MSWI bottom ash integration results in a denser microstructure, with the formation of hydration products filling the pores, compared to mixes without MSWI bottom ash. The static yield stress within the first 60 min for R-0, R-10, R-20, and R-30 were 739.5 Pa, 2062 Pa, 1177.2 Pa, and 1036.5 Pa, respectively. Similarly, the dynamic yield stress values within the same resting time and replacement levels were 287.0 Pa, 311.2 Pa, 223.53 Pa, and 178.9 Pa, respectively. The structuration rates for R-0, R-10, R-20, and R-30 were 2.9 Pa/min, 6.6 Pa/min, 7.3 Pa/min, and 4.1 Pa/min, respectively. These results indicate that recycled MSWI bottom ash enhances static and dynamic yield stresses and structuration rates, with the optimal rheological performance observed at a 10 % replacement level. The rheological evolution indicates a significant impact of time and MSWI bottom ash content on static yield stress. Notably, the material exhibits considerable strength gains between 45 and 60 min after mixing. Concrete with 10 % MSWI bottom ash shows a 12 % increase in compressive strength at 1 day, with no significant changes at 28 and 90 days. These findings suggest MSWI bottom ash is a promising, sustainable alternative for reducing cement content in 3D concrete printing applications.

AB The sustainable development of low-carbon buildings has aroused widespread concern in the whole society. This study aims to propose a three-step carbon reduction strategy based on innovative design, intelligent construction and secondary utilization, and provide a new solution for carbon reduction in the construction industry. Based on the life cycle assessment method, the system boundary and calculation model of carbon emission and carbon compensation in each stage of building life cycle are redefined, and the carbon reduction effect of the mixed three-step strategy is quantitatively analyzed through the case carbon emission data, which proves the scientific feasibility of the carbon reduction strategy in this paper. The research shows that it has a good carbon reduction effect whether it is adopting structural optimization aided design in the architectural design stage, upgrading the traditional construction technology with 3D printing intelligent construction technology, or effectively disposing of the construction waste for recycling.

AB Plastic waste poses a serious threat to ecosystems and human health. Similarly, the increasing use of automobiles has led to a rise in discarded tires, exacerbating environmental concerns. However, repurposing this waste into new materials promotes sustainability and supports the concept of a circular economy. In this study, we explored the combination of reclaimed ground tire rubber (rGTR) and additive manufacturing technology (3D printing) for the development of novel conductive filaments. For this purpose, a filament composed of 25% rGTR, 25% carbon black (CB), and 50% low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was formulated for constructing additively manufactured electrodes. The produced filament exhibited excellent flexibility, with successful incorporation of rGTR into the matrix, as confirmed by TGA, SEM and AFM data. 3D-printed working electrodes prepared using rGTR, CB, and LDPE subjected to an atmospheric air plasma pen (3D-CB/rGTR/LDPE-PT) were applied for detecting a hazardous fungicide, carbendazim (CBZ). Thus, under optimized differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) conditions, the sensor demonstrated a linear response ranging from 1.0 to 40.0 mu mol L-1 CBZ, with limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) of 79 nmol L-1 and 262 nmol L-1, respectively. The proposed 3D-CB/rGTR/LDPE-PT sensor was successfully applied for detecting CBZ in drinking water and effluent samples, achieving recovery rates between 95 and 105%, highlighting its excellent analytical performance. This work demonstrates that recycled raw materials from the automotive industry can be repurposed to develop innovative devices for detecting environmental contamination caused by indiscriminate pesticide use, while also simultaneously promoting sustainability through the reuse and recycling of waste tire rubber.

AB Balancing low-carbon content with performance in 3D printed concrete (3DPC) remains a key challenge for wider application. This study demonstrates the researchers' self-developed low-carbon mix design combining 20 % recycled sand replacement, a low binder-to-sand ratio of 1:2, and a hybrid fiber system using Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) and Basalt Fiber (BF) for 3DPC. The effects of hybrid fibers on the rheology, mechanical properties, and anisotropy of low-carbon 3DPC were systematically investigated through two experimental groups, namely: Group I where the PVA content was fixed at 0.25 % while BF content varied from 0 % to 0.4 %; and Group II where the total fiber content was fixed at 0.5 % whilst the optimal PVA/BF ratio was explored. In addition, a cradle-to-gate (A1-A3) life-cycle assessment was performed to quantify embodied carbon. The results showed that appropriate proportions of hybrid PVA/BF fibers significantly increased static yield stress (up to 40.3 %), while the hydrophobic BF fibers reduced dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity, optimizing the balance between buildability and extrudability. Optimal mixes reached compressive strengths near 50 MPa, about a 42.2 % increase over the control group. Furthermore, hybrid fibers reduced the compressive anisotropy index from 8.8 to 1.1. Failure mode analysis showed that 3DPC had obvious directional weaknesses, among which the interlayer bonding was the main weak point. It was further observed that PVA fibers were mainly pulled out, while BF fibers were fractured. However, when the two fibers were added in similar amounts, agglomeration occurred, reducing their synergistic effect. The cradle-to-gate Life-cycle impact assessment (LCA) indicates that the proposed P40B10 mix-through substantial cement reduction, partial replacement of natural sand with recycled sand, and hybrid PVA/BF reinforcement-markedly improves carbon efficiency of 3DPC, roughly halving the strength-normalized carbon intensity compared with reference mixes. The research provides theoretical support and practical guidance for the rheological regulation, mechanical strengthening and isotropic optimization of low-carbon 3DPC.

DE Plastic PET bottles; shredder machine; cost-effective; blade analysis;
   3D printing
AB In the current situation, plastic use is expanding daily, leading to a significant environmental problem. Plastics can negatively affect soil organisms in a variety of ways through complex interactions. For example, it has been found that microplastics seep into the soil and change its physical makeup, which lowers the soil's ability to hold water. Particularly in India, people generate 26,000 tons of plastic waste every day which is equivalent to 26,000 small cars(approximately). Ineffective waste management, such as incorrect waste collection and recycling, is the main cause of concern when it comes to plastic waste in India, not the quantity of waste generated. So, the purpose of our project is to design and build a small plastic shredder that can shred plastic PET bottles into tiny pieces that may be used to generate 3D printing filament (future work). Although they currently exist, they are prohibitively expensive. Therefore, the primary goal of this project is to design and build a mini shredder at a reasonable cost using Solid Works. The components of this shredder machine include a 0.25 HP motor, grate, collection system, hopper, and cutting chamber (frame) with rotating and fixed blades. This paper explains the design requirements for every component of the shredder machine.

AB This study presents a novel three-dimensional (3D) printable gallium-carbon black-styrene isoprene styrene block copolymer (Ga-CB-SIS), offering a versatile solution for the rapid fabrication of stretchable and integrated sensor-heater-battery systems in wearable and recyclable electronics. The composite exhibits sinter-free characteristics, allowing for printing on various substrates, including heat-sensitive materials. Unlike traditional conductive inks, the Ga-CB-SIS composite, composed of gallium, carbon black, and styrene isoprene block copolymers, combines electrical conductivity, stretchability, and digital printability. By introducing carbon black as a filler material, the composite achieves promising electromechanical behavior, making it suitable for low-resistance heaters, batteries, and electrical interconnects. The fabrication process involves a simultaneous mixing and ball-milling technique, resulting in a homogeneous composition with a CB/Ga ratio of 4.3%. The Ga-CB-SIS composite showcases remarkable adaptability for digital printing on various substrates. Its self-healing property and efficient recycling technique using a deep eutectic solvent contribute to an environmentally conscious approach to electronic waste, with a high gallium recovery efficiency of similar to 98%. The study's innovation extends to applications, presenting a fully digitally printed stretchable Ga-CB-SIS battery integrated with strain sensors and heaters, representing a significant leap in LM-based composites. This multifunctional and sustainable Ga-CB-SIS composite emerges as a key player in the future of wearable electronics, offering integrated circuits with sensing, heating, and energy storage elements.

AB Plastic waste is an outstanding environmental thread. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most abundantly produced single-use plastics worldwide, but its recycling rates are low. In parallel, additive manufacturing is a rapidly evolving technology with wide-ranging applications. Thus, there is a need for a broad spectrum of polymers to meet the demands of this growing industry and address post-use waste materials. This perspective article highlights the potential of designing microbial cell factories to upcycle PET into functionalized chemical building blocks for additive manufacturing. We present the leveraging of PET hydrolyzing enzymes and rewiring the bacterial C2 and aromatic catabolic pathways to obtain high-value chemicals and polymers. Since PET mechanical recycling back to original materials is cost-prohibitive, the biochemical technology is a viable alternative to upcycle PET into novel 3D printing materials, such as replacements for acrylonitrile butadiene styrene. The presented hybrid chemo-bio approaches potentially enable the manufacturing of environmentally friendly degradable or higher-value high-performance polymers and composites and their reuse for a circular economy.One-Sentence Summary Biotransformation of waste PET to high-value platform chemicals for additive manufacturing.

AB Sustainable polymers are materials derived from renewable, recycled and waste carbon resources and their combinations, which at the end of life can be recycled, biodegraded or composted. Sustainable polymers also exhibit reduced environmental impact throughout their life cycle. This Primer presents an overview of the research in and potential of sustainable polymers, with a focus on their life cycle, synthetic routes from renewable carbon feedstocks, production, material characterization, applications, end of life, data reproducibility and limitations faced, and provides a brief outlook. The Primer also briefly covers other carbon feedstocks such as carbon dioxide and wastes, including agricultural and woody residues. Although still in their infancy, new sustainable polymers are already finding applications in packaging, automotive parts and 3D printing. This Primer also discusses the headwinds facing the adoption of sustainable polymers, including complexities of recycling and composting, manufacturing scale-up, data reproducibility, deposition and potential solutions. Development of sustainable polymers will accelerate the age of sustainable polymers and create a truly circular economy for plastics by reducing production and use of virgin plastics from finite resources.

AB Recycled additive manufacturing sensing platforms are fabricated with carboxylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (COOH-MWCNT) with exhibit enhanced electrochemical biosensor performance allowing for the enhanced direct coupling of the biorecognition element to the COOH-MWCNT for the preparation of an electrochemical genosensor for the detection of yellow fever virus cDNA. Bespoke additive manufacturing filaments was produced using recycled poly(lactic acid) (rPLA, 65 wt%), polyethylene succinate (PES, 10 wt%), carbon black (CB, 15 wt%), and COOH-MWCNT (10 wt%) which exhibits enhanced electrochemical performance over that of commercial filament. A bespoke all-in-one additive manufactured electroanalytical cell is proposed, with the working, reference and counter electrodes in addition to a modification rim that allows for the facile production of biosensors through the application of droplets. The genosensor was applied to the detection of yellow fever Virus cDNA using anodic square wave voltammetry; a linear dynamic range (LDR) of 0.5-15 mu M with an R2 of 0.9995, sensitivity of 177 +/- 2 mu A mu M-1, limit of detection (LOD) of 0.138 mu M, and limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.859 mu M were obtained. This work highlights how bespoke additive manufacturing filament production can enhance biosensing platforms, whilst using recycled feedstock to improve end-product sustainability.

AB The present-day ubiquity of smart devices used under extreme conditions demands robust and more sustainable energy storage. Therefore, lightweight electrodes with both excellent electrochemical and mechanical performance to meet these needs are of great importance. Moreover, the recycling of current energy storage devices poses significant environmental concerns, a particularly daunting prospect given the increasing waste volume of metal-based electrodes. To that end, these challenges of performance and sustainability are addressed by leveraging accessible digital light processing (DLP) technology and tailored post-process heat treatment to fabricate a metal-based 3D substrate with ultrahigh precision and hierarchical porosity. Here, a 4-mm-thickness metal-based electrode with NiCo2S4 loading of 18.38 mg cm(-2) achieves a high areal capacity of 7.327 mA h cm(-2) at 44.85 mA cm(-2), providing a promising way to fabricate high-performance thick electrodes. Most importantly, these electrodes can be fabricated from recyclable metal salt feedstock. The geometric freedom offered by 3D printing supplemented by finite element analyses allows for optimized complex structures to be fabricated. Through rational design realized by 3D printing, a desirable compromise between building density, mechanical properties, electrochemical performances, and environment-friendly processing cycle can be arrived upon.

AB The circular economy requires high-value material recovery to enable multiple product lifecycles. This implies the need for additive manufacturing to focus on the development and use of low-impact materials that, after product use, can be reconstituted to their original properties in terms of printability and functionality. We therefore investigated reprintable materials, made from bio-based resources. In order to equally consider material properties and recovery during development, we took a design approach to material development. In this way, the full material and product life cycle was studied, including multiple recovery steps. We applied this method to the development of a reprintable bio-based composite material for extrusion paste printing. This material is derived from natural and abundant resources, i.e., ground mussel shells and alginate. The alginate in the printing paste is ionically cross-linked after printing to create a water-resistant material. This reaction can be reversed to retain a printable paste. We studied paste composition, printability and material properties and 3D printed a design prototype. Alginate as a binder shows good printing and reprinting behaviour, as well as promising material properties. It thus demonstrates the concept of reprintable materials.

AB Continuous Fibre Reinforced Thermoplastic Composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming alternative materials to replace the conventional thermosetting polymers and metals due to excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential used in lightweight structures. Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of CFRTPCs due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. The mechanical properties of a built part depend on several process parameters. The aim of this study is to characterize the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the mechanical performance of 3D printed continuous fibre reinforced composites components manufactured by a desktop 3D printer. Tensile and three-point bending tests are carried out to determine the mechanical response of the printed specimens. SEM images of fractured surfaces are evaluated to determine the effects of process parameters on failure modes.
   It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the mechanical performance is marginally significant. In addition, continuous fibre reinforced samples show higher strength and stiffness values than unreinforced ones. The results show that carbon fibre reinforced composites exhibit the best mechanical performance with higher stiffness and flat samples exhibit higher values of strength and stiffness than on-edge samples. Additionally, the results show that strength and stiffness increase as fibre volume content increases in most cases but, conversely, the level of increment in mechanical performance is moderate with continued rise in fibre content, particularly in the case of Kevlar (R) and glass fibres, due to weak bonding between the fibre/nylon layers as well as the presence of increased levels of defects. Finally, the practicality of the results is assessed by testing an evaluation structure.

AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the tensile strength and compressive behaviour of two thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments produced via material extrusion (ME): TPU 95A and Reciflex (recycled).Design/methodology/approachTensile strength and compressive behaviour are assessed. The influence of extrusion temperature and infill pattern on these properties is examined, supported by thermal characterization, surface morphology analyses and a comprehensive comparison with existing literature. An analytical method is presented for estimating the solid ratio of ME parts, using an ellipse model to describe the material bead geometry.FindingsReciflex is generally stiffer than TPU 95A in both tensile and compressive tests. Specimens loaded orthogonally in compression tests exhibited stiffer behaviour than those loaded parallelly, and higher tensile properties were typically observed when material beads were deposited parallel to the load direction. Unlike TPU 95A, Reciflex is sensitive to extrusion temperature variations.Social implicationsBy comparing recycled and virgin TPU filaments, this research addresses waste management concerns and advocates for environmentally sustainable production practices in the broadly used filament/based ME technique.Originality/valueThis study provides an extensive comparison of computed values with existing literature, offering insights into how different materials may behave under similar processing conditions. Given ongoing challenges in controlling melt flow during extrusion, these results may offer insights for optimizing the production of ME parts made with thermoplastic elastomers.

AB Achieving the 2050 carbon neutrality targets calls for change, especially in what are identified as the most energy -intensive production sectors. Among these, the construction industry sector certainly requires special attention to promote sustainable and more circular actions. Moreover, the so-called green transition is considered the same as an additional European goal, namely that of the digital transition. The research presented in this article falls precisely within these two fields of study. It illustrates the process and methodological approach developed to produce a new panel for use in construction. This panel is made with Hemp-Pla, where hemp comes from the residues of threshing leaves, and is printed with additive technology. The achievement of the final result has required the elaboration of six prototypes, differentiated from each other according to the geometry of the section, the thickness, and the infill. The development of several prototypes made it possible to identify the main printing difficulties and the time and amount of material required. Based on the knowledge gained during the printing process of these prototypes and the analyses aimed at knowing their main thermal performance, it was possible to design and create a commercial -scale panel. Its energy performance values are comparable to panels already made from traditional materials. In addition, the Life Cycle Assessment showed that the results obtained are auspicious for bringing the printed panels made from Hemp-Pla to the construction industry market.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore how rising technologies from Industry 4.0 can be integrated with circular economy (CE) practices to establish a business model that reuses and recycles wasted material such as scrap metal or e-waste. Design/methodology/approach The qualitative research method was deployed in three stages. Stage 1 was a literature review of concepts, successful factors and barriers related to the transition towards a CE along with sustainable supply chain management, smart production systems and additive manufacturing (AM). Stage 2 comprised a conceptual framework to integrate and evaluate the synergistic potential among these concepts. Finally, stage 3 validated the proposed model by collecting rich qualitative data based on semi-structured interviews with managers, researchers and professors of operations management to gather insightful and relevant information. Findings The outcome of the study is the recommendation of a circular model to reuse scrap electronic devices, integrating web technologies, reverse logistics and AM to support CE practices. Results suggest a positive influence from improving business sustainability by reinserting waste into the supply chain to manufacture products on demand.
   Social implications The purpose of this study was to explore how Industry 4.0 technologies are integrated with CE practices. This allows for the proposal of a circular business model for recycling waste and delivering new products, significantly reducing resource consumption and optimising natural resources. In a first stage, the circular business model can be used to recycle electronic scrap, with the proposed integration of web technologies, reverse logistics and AM as a technological platform to support the model. These have several environmental, sociotechnical and economic implications for society. Originality/value The sociotechnical aspects are directly impacted by the circular smart production system (CSPS) management model, since it creates a new culture of reuse and recycling techniques for urban waste using 3D printing technologies, as well as Industry 4.0 concepts to increase production on demand and automate manufacturing processes. The tendency of the CSPS model is to contribute to deployment CE in the manufacture of new products or parts with AM approaches, generating a new path of supply and demand for society.

AB The recycling of post-industrial waste poly(lactic acid) (PI-PLA) from coffee machine pods into electroanalytical sensors for the detection of caffeine in real tea and coffee samples is reported herein. The PI-PLA is transformed into both nonconductive and conductive filaments to produce full electroanalytical cells, including additively manufactured electrodes (AMEs). The electroanalytical cell was designed utilizing separate prints for the cell body and electrodes to increase the recyclability of the system. The cell body made from nonconductive filament was able to be recycled three times before the feedstock-induced print failure. Three bespoke formulations of conductive filament were produced, with the PI-PLA (61.62 wt %), carbon black (CB, 29.60 wt %), and poly(ethylene succinate) (PES, 8.78 wt %) chosen as the most suitable for use due to its equivalent electrochemical performance, lower material cost, and improved thermal stability compared to the filaments with higher PES loading and ability to be printable. It was shown that this system could detect caffeine with a sensitivity of 0.055 +/- 0.001 mu A mu M-1, a limit of detection of 0.23 mu M, a limit of quantification of 0.76 mu M, and a relative standard deviation of 3.14% after activation. Interestingly, the nonactivated 8.78% PES electrodes produced significantly better results in this regard than the activated commercial filament toward the detection of caffeine. The activated 8.78% PES electrode was shown to be able to detect the caffeine content in real and spiked Earl Grey tea and Arabica coffee samples with excellent recoveries (96.7-102%). This work reports a paradigm shift in the way AM, electrochemical research, and sustainability can synergize and feed into part of a circular economy, akin to a circular economy electrochemistry.

AB This study analyses the feasibility of utilizing waste slate particles as a strengthening component in affordable 3D-printed composite materials to address environmental issues associated with waste management. Composite filaments were created by incorporating waste slate particles (5 %, 10 %, and 15 % by weight) into an acrylo-nitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix and subsequently evaluated for mechanical properties. A twin-screw extruder obtained the composite filaments, while test samples were produced using a 3D printer by fused deposition modelling. The developed composites have a gradual variation in evaluated properties, about an 8 % increment in hardness, and a 40 % increment in flexural and tensile modulus was noted on the inclusion of 15 wt % of waste slate particles in the ABS matrix. The composites filled with 10 wt% and 5 wt% waste slate particles exhibited the maximum flexural strength (65.24 MPa) and tensile strength (42.11 MPa), respectively. These values were 5 % and 8 % higher than those of unfilled ABS. Furthermore, it was shown that the ABS matrix saw a decrease in elongation and impact strength as the dosage of slate particles increased. The fractured surface morphology indicated that filament breaking, filler pullout, and the creation of voids between neighbouring layers were the primary causes of material failure. The dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) results show the reinforcing effect of slate particles by an increase of storage modulus with 13 % at 35 degrees C for the composite with 10 wt% slate particles and 20 % for that with 15 wt% slate particles. DMA results analyzed the composite's adhesion factor, degree of entanglement, reinforcement efficiency factor, and effectiveness factor to clarify the reinforcing mechanism of slate particles. The study determines that the most effective utilization of waste slate particles in an ABS matrix is achieved by including 10 wt%. The results of this study enhance the concept of recycling waste slate powder and reveal the potential for their utilization in several industries, including the aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and architectural sectors of 3D printing.

AB This study investigates the alkali activation of waste glass powder (WGP) for developing 3D printable geopolymer concrete. The rheological, mechanical, and fire-resistance of 3D printed concrete were evaluated to determine the effect of WGP as a partial substitution for fly ash in geopolymers. Rheological results show that incorporation of WGP reduces the rheological properties of printable mixes. For instance, the apparent viscosity of mixes containing 50% WGP was reduced by 48% at low shear rate (0.1 s-1), and 46% at high shear rate (100 s-1). The corresponding reductions in the dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity were 35% and 55%, respectively, indicating improved flowability and pumpability. However, compressive strength declined with increased WGP. The 28-day mold-cast strength decreased from 51.4 MPa to 35.6 MPa at 50% WGP. In contrast, the elevated temperature properties are enhanced with reduced strength loss for the WGP incorporated specimens, attributed to the sintering effect of WGP. .

AB This paper reports the in-house development of rapid tooling (RT) through micro additive manufacturing (MAM) with reinforcement of SiC/Al(2)O(3)in primary-recycled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) domestic waste. The reinforcement in recycled LDPE was made in different particulate sizes (mu m), namely, single particle size (SPS)/double particle size (DPS)/triple particle size (TPS) and in different weight proportions. The best combinations based upon wear and thermal stability were selected and used for filament wire preparation with twin-screw extruder (TSE). The cylindrical pins as RT reinforced with SiC/Al(2)O(3)were 3D printed on fused deposition modelling (FDM) setup for grinding applications. The outcome of the study highlights that SiC-TPS reinforcement in recycled LDPE matrix resulted in improved wear characteristics of RT prepared as MAM. Further thermographs based upon differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were plotted to ensure the thermal stability of RT prepared through MAM.

AB Low-density polyethylene (LDPE) is a soft thermoplastic with extensive application as a packing material such as plastic bags, dispensing bottles, milk pouches, etc. Many LDPE bags are used and dumped in landfills every year, leading to millions of tons of persistent waste. In addition, the recycling of LDPE is of no commercial interest due to its low stiffness, poor mechanical properties, and limited commercial application. In the current work, we attempt to recycle milk pouches made of LDPE to create polymer filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM), thereby adding value to waste plastic by converting it into high- value 3D printer filament. This research examines the feasibility of reclamation of waste LDPE milk pouches as filament for 3D printers and studies the changes in filament's chemical and mechanical properties when produced at different temperatures. The waste milk pouches are cleaned thoroughly, shredded, and extruded using a single screw extruder at three nozzle temperatures, i.e., 150 degrees C, 180 degrees C, 210 degrees C. The extruded specimens are analyzed using an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM) for surface texture. The effect of change in process temperature on flow behaviors is also studied by integrating a current sensor and an encoder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis is performed on the filaments and the used LDPE milk pouches to compare the chemical bondings of the polymer. The mechanical properties of the extruded filaments are examined using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The morphological analysis, chemical characterization, and mechanical characterization of prepared filaments are presented. The results show that the chemical bondings are intact after extrusion at all the temperatures examined in this work. The surface texture and the mechanical properties are better at higher temperatures owing to better fluidity and are more suitable for fused deposition modeling. Thus, it is possible to valorize waste LDPE milk pouches by transforming them into filaments for 3D printing.

AB PurposeThis study aims to investigate the tensile strength and compressive behaviour of two thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) filaments produced via material extrusion (ME): TPU 95A and Reciflex (recycled).Design/methodology/approachTensile strength and compressive behaviour are assessed. The influence of extrusion temperature and infill pattern on these properties is examined, supported by thermal characterization, surface morphology analyses and a comprehensive comparison with existing literature. An analytical method is presented for estimating the solid ratio of ME parts, using an ellipse model to describe the material bead geometry.FindingsReciflex is generally stiffer than TPU 95A in both tensile and compressive tests. Specimens loaded orthogonally in compression tests exhibited stiffer behaviour than those loaded parallelly, and higher tensile properties were typically observed when material beads were deposited parallel to the load direction. Unlike TPU 95A, Reciflex is sensitive to extrusion temperature variations.Social implicationsBy comparing recycled and virgin TPU filaments, this research addresses waste management concerns and advocates for environmentally sustainable production practices in the broadly used filament/based ME technique.Originality/valueThis study provides an extensive comparison of computed values with existing literature, offering insights into how different materials may behave under similar processing conditions. Given ongoing challenges in controlling melt flow during extrusion, these results may offer insights for optimizing the production of ME parts made with thermoplastic elastomers.

AB Sandwich panels, characterized by their solid exterior and thick, soft core, find extensive applications ranging from maritime to aerospace sectors due to their exceptional resilience and energy absorption/dissipation capabilities. The natural limpet, known for its resilience to mechanical loading, serves as inspiration in the present research to introduce innovative repairable core shells. Limpet-inspired shells with elasto-plastic and brittle behaviors are designed and 3D/4D printed using polylactic acid (PLA) filaments and resins via fused filament fabrication (FFF) and liquid crystal display (LCD) techniques. While PLA filament exhibits an elasto-plastic response with a shape-recovery feature, the resin results in brittle structures for LCD-printed design. The study demonstrates that the FFF-printed PLA shell can fully recover residual plastic deformations, while the LCDprinted PLA shell exhibits a mechanical fracture behavior very similar to the natural limpet with brittle properties. A nonlinear finite element model (FEM) is also developed to replicate the large deformations of the samples under quasi-static compression with a high level of accuracy. Experimental and numerical results reveal that the samples with material, mechanical behavior, and geometry close to the natural limpet result in the maximum energy dissipation per unit mass. Two bio-inspired cores are then tessellated to introduce a new class of sustainable sandwich panels with supreme recoverability, resiliency, and repairability. A three-point bending test is numerically carried out on sandwich panels using FEM, and their energy absorption and dissipation capacities are studied. Results demonstrate that the proposed sandwich panels can achieve almost 7.33 and 1.17 times higher energy dissipation per unit mass than those developed based on a recycled thermoplastic bottle cap core. This pioneering research sets a new benchmark for structural design in terms of resiliency, recoverability, repairability, and sustainability.

AB This research is a comprehensive review of the sustainability of additive manufacturing, from the circular economy and recycling of materials to other environmental challenges involving the safety of materials and manufacturing. There has been important progress in this area, with an increasing number of papers that cover diverse environmental aspects, including the circular economy, recycling and the life cycle assessment of materials. This increase is due to the importance that scientists, industry, government and society are now giving to these topics. This review seeks to develop a greater awareness in relation to the possibilities and implications in the use of the AM, as well as to encourage sustainable development by raising awareness in relation to the taking of necessary actions to achieve compliance of the Sustainable Development Goals. Similarly, current trends are examined in relation to the practices that are currently being adopted in order to ensure that AM is consolidated as a sustainable and convenient practice in the economic, social and environmental spheres. In general, polymers, ceramics, metals and composite materials are now undergoing intensive research to improve their use. Although this research shows that significant progress has been made on several relevant issues, using materials optimization to minimize energy and waste is still far from a global solution.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) technologies can produce lighter parts; reduce manual assembly processes; reduce the number of production steps; shorten the production cycle; significantly reduce material consumption; enable the production of prostheses, implants, and artificial organs; and produce end-user products since it is used in many sectors for many reasons; it has also started to be used widely, especially in the field of aerospace. In this study, polylactic acid (PLA) was preferred for the antenna substrate because it is environmentally friendly, easy to recycle, provides convenience in production design with a three-dimensional (3D) printer, and is less expensive compared to other available materials. Copper (Cu) tape and graphene filament were employed for the antenna patch component due to their benefits. The comprehensive comparative analysis between a full-wave model and a 3D-printed prototype of the antenna via the CST Microwave Studio program was demonstrated here. The surface characterization was achieved with scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX) and X-ray diffractometer (XRD) analysis. The homogeneous Cu and oxidized graphene (GO) were detected. The weight percent of carbon (C) and oxygen (O) on the graphene surface was 59.82% and 40.18%, respectively. The Cu (111), Cu (200), and Cu (220) peaks were determined on the Cu tape. The GO (011) peak was seen in the XRD spectra of the graphene sheet. The simulation and measurement comparisons are quite satisfactory. The antennas, produced using a conventional 3D printer, will be beneficial for various applications in aeronautics and astronautics.

AB The physical and mechanical characteristics of a novel mortar that uses recycled PET powder as a replacement for natural sand are examined in this paper. This study specifically looks at the impacts of replacing recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) powder in place of fine aggregates in mortars. To create five distinct mortar mixes, recycled PET powder was substituted in varying proportions (0%-30% by volume of the sand). The investigation focuses on the physical and mechanical characteristics of the material, including density, slump, water absorption, ultrasonic pulse velocity, flexural and compressive strength, and microstructural and interface characterization. Results reveal that the substitution of recycled PET powder reduces slump, compressive strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, dry and wet density, and slump, whereas flexural strength and fracture energy exhibit the reverse tendency. The slump variation indicates the controllable workability of the mortar in the fresh state. The latter feature is quite important for the application of such a material where flowability is a dominating parameter, e.g., 3D printing. Two data-driven models for the compressive and flexural strength reduction factors as a function of the substitution ratio based on symbolic regression techniques are proposed using the findings of this study in conjunction with data from the literature.

AB The organic fillers and honeycomb lattice structure intruded novel bio-composite materials for the 3D printing application is a practical and eco-friendly approach for developing lightweight biopolymeric components. The present work investigates the impact of incorporation of hexagon lattice structure on the walnut shell/PLA polymeric composite material using the Fused Deposition Modelling method. The printing process parameters such as nozzle temperature, layer height, infill density, and printing speed are varied to optimize the tensile and dimensional area error properties. Taguchi optimization technique is employed to find the optimal printing condition for the effective experimental output responses. The results from the experiments clearly show that the maximum tensile strength of 2.684 MPa was observed on the optimized printing condition of nozzle temperature of 210celcius, a layer height of 0.1 mm, an infill density of 100 %, and a printing speed of 20 mm/sec. The developed mathematical model from the regression analysis depicted the R-square value concerning the output responses like tensile strength will be 92.24, and dimensional area error will be 87.48. It proclaims that; the model is fit for the large-scale production of the hexagon lattice structure in the walnut shell/PLA composite. Furthermore, the macrographs of the tested composites fabricated at higher infill density exhibited lower sidewall edge failure than the samples fabricated at the lowest infill density percentages.

AB In the past decade, the use of secondary (2 degrees) recycled polymers (such as polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and polyurethane) has been explored for smart engineering applications such as self-healing, self-expanding, and contracting. But hitherto little has been reported on the use of tertiary (3 degrees) recycled polymers for such applications. In this work, 2 degrees and 3 degrees recycled PVDF-based thermoplastic composites have been compared to establish a suitable recycling process for 3D-/4D-printing applications in the repair of heritage structures. The 3 degrees recycled composite matrix was prepared by chemical-assisted mechanical blending (CAMB) also known as solution blending of PVDF and CaCO3. The rheological, thermal, mechanical, bonding, morphological, and piezoelectric properties of prepared composites were compared with composite prepared by 2 degrees recycling (mechanical melt blending). Further chemical treatment (as a stimulus) was performed to investigate the effect on the one-way programming of the composite. The results of the study outlined that CAMB is more suitable than mechanical melt blending as a material processing route for PVDF-CaCO3 composite with acceptable one-way programming features. In this study, the rheological, thermal, mechanical, and piezoelectric properties of 3 degrees recycled composite were observed better than those of 2 degrees recycled composite. Further, the observations from morphological (scattered scanning microscopy-energy-dispersive spectroscopy), bonding characteristics (x-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy), magnetic properties (vibration sample magnetometry), and photoluminescence analyses of the composite supported the outcome.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) was a promising adsorbent for the contaminants removal in the wastewater. However, the nanoscale GO with the properties of easy agglomeration and difficult to separate in the solution severely restricted its widespread practical application. Therefore, a monolithic and structured GO bulk was prepared by a 3D printing method and used as adsorbent for the removal of Cu2+ ions. The rheological property and printability of the ink, as well as the mechanical property and adsorption capacity of the printed GO bulk were investigated. It was found that the optimal ratio of GO: sodium alginate was 1.5:2.0 with the compressive strength was 6.23 MPa. Batch experiments exhibited that the Cu2+ sorption was an endothermic reaction and the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir model was 179.32 mg/g at 303.15 K. Kinetics, FTIR and XPS analysis revealed that the mechanism of Cu2+ adsorption was mainly a chemical dominated process involving the oxygen functional groups contained in GO and sodium alginate. The desorption and regeneration test results indicated that the printed GO bulk was an ideal adsorbent for heavy metals removal in real applications due to its excellent adsorption capacity and convenient recycling performance.

AB Aerogels are of great interest in diverse fields including thermal insulation, environmental protection, liquid separation, electromagnetic shielding, etc. However, the development of renewable and recyclable aerogels, especially synthetic polymer-based ones, remains an enormous challenge, which seriously hinders the practical application of aerogels. Herein, utilizing Kevlar nanofibers (KNFs) as representative synthetic polymer building blocks, a destabilizing dynamic balance (DDB) strategy is proposed to fabricate recyclable aerogels with high reprocessing consistency. More specifically, aprotic esters (e.g., di-tert-butyl decarbonate, DiBoc) and alkalis (e.g., potassium tert-butoxide, t-BuOK) are introduced to trigger the destabilizing dynamic balance between deprotonation-protonation of KNFs, resulting in a reversible sol-gel transition. Meanwhile, the duration of sol-gel transition (i.e., gelation) time, adjustable from 10(-2) to 10(3) min, is compatible with versatile processing methods, such as static mould casting, dynamic wet spinning, dynamic blade coating and dynamic 3D printing. These unique advantages enable the fabrication of various KNF aerogel products (i.e., continuous fibers, continuous films, large-sized monoliths and 3D-printed articles) with low density (33-165 mg/cm(3)), high compressive modulus (up to 52 MPa), high specific surface area (360-404 m(2)/g) and low thermal conductivity (0.027-0.050 W/mmiddotK). Notably, these properties are comparable or superior to that of previously reported KNF aerogels and far superior to that of recyclable aerogels. Compared with direct fabrication from raw materials, the DDB strategy reduces the cost by 50.5% and 82.5% when products are made from recycled aerogels and wet gels, respectively. Such cost reduction further increases with the number of recycling cycles, which is calculated as $275 per kilogram KNF aerogel with 5 cycles. This work develops extraordinary KNF aerogels those can be recycled and reused, as well as provides a strategy that can be applied to design more recyclable aerogels.

AB Mycelium biocomposites are eco-friendly, cheap, easy to produce, and have competitive mechanical properties. However, their integration in the built environment as durable and long-lasting materials is not solved yet. Similarly, biocomposites from recycled food waste such as seashells have been gaining increasing interest recently, thanks to their sustainable impact and richness in calcium carbonate and chitin. The current study tests the mycelium binding effect to bioweld a seashell biocomposite 3D-printed brick. The novelty of this study is the combination of mycelium and a non-agro-based substrate, which is seashells. As well as testing the binding capacity of mycelium in welding the lattice curvilinear form of the V3 linear Brick model (V3-LBM). Thus, the V3-LBM is 3D printed in three separate profiles, each composed of five layers of 1 mm/layer thickness, using seashell biocomposite by paste extrusion and testing it for biowelding with Pleurotus ostreatus mycelium to offer a sustainable, ecofriendly, biomineralized brick. The biowelding process investigated the penetration and binding capacity of the mycelium between every two 3D-printed profiles. A cellulose-based culture medium was used to catalyse the mycelium growth. The mycelium biowelding capacity was investigated by SEM microscopy and EDX chemical analysis of three samples from the side corner (S), middle (M), and lateral (L) zones of the biowelded brick. The results revealed that the best biowelding effect was recorded at the corner and lateral zones of the brick. The SEM images exhibited the penetration and the bridging effect achieved by the dense mycelium. The EDX revealed the high concentrations of carbon, oxygen, and calcium at all the analyzed points on the SEM images from all three samples. An inverted relationship between carbon and oxygen as well as sodium and potassium concentrations were also detected, implying the active metabolic interaction between the fungal hyphae and the seashell-based biocomposite. Finally, the results of the SEM-EDX analysis were applied to design favorable tessellation and staking methods for the V3-LBM from the seashell-mycelium composite to deliver enhanced biowelding effect along the Z axis and the XY axis with <1 mm tessellation and staking tolerance.

AB The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) due to human activities is a major driver of global warming. To mitigate CO2 emissions, Carbon Capture, Utilisation, and Sequestration (CCUS) technologies are critical, particularly in the construction sector, which significantly contributes to global CO2 emissions, especially through cement production. Cement-based materials have the potential to store CO2 through mineralisation, making them attractive for CCUS initiatives. 3D printed concrete (3DPC) offers many benefits; however, its significant cement consumption presents sustainability challenges. To address this, CO2 sequestration methods and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) are increasingly being employed in 3DPC to reduce cement usage and carbon footprint. This study reviews recent advancements in CO2 sequestration methods within 3DPC, such as COQ curing, COQ jetting, and COQ mixing methods, along with their reaction mechanisms, while also examining the role of SCMs and recycled aggregates in reducing carbon emissions. Key findings indicate that 3DPC structures, with their structural design, characterised by their hollow-lattice cross-section and adjustable printing parameters, enhance CO2 ingress potential via CO2 sequestration techniques such as CO2 curing and CO2 jetting. Moreover, introducing CO2 during mixing serves as an accelerator, aiding in the development of desired strength after deposition of 3DPC. Furthermore, incorporating low-carbon materials significantly reduces the carbon footprint in 3DPC compared to cast concrete. Consequently, efforts to reduce cement content by incorporating SCMs and sequestering CO2 within 3DPC offer viable avenues for promoting sustainable construction practices. It also examines the environmental impact of different 3DPC mix designs and provides recommendations to improve sequestration efficiency and practical implementation. By adopting sustainable materials and innovative carbon sequestration techniques, the sustainability of 3DPC can be substantially enhanced.

AB To overcome the challenge of upcycling plastic waste into three-dimensional (3D) printing filament in the distributed recycling and additive manufacturing systems, this study designs, builds, tests, and validates an open-source filament diameter sensor for recycling and winding machines. The modular system for multi-axis optical control of the diameter of the recycled 3D-printer filament makes it possible to scan part of the surface of the processed filament, save the history of measurements along the entire length of the spool, as well as mark defective areas. The sensor is developed as an independent module and integrated into a recyclebot. It was tested on different kinds of polymers (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactide (PLA)), different sources of plastic, and different colors including clear plastic. The results were compared with the manual measurements, and the measurements obtained with a one-dimensional digital light caliper. The results found that the developed open-source filament sensing method allows users to obtain significantly more information in comparison with basic one-dimensional light sensors and using the received data not only for more accurate diameter measurements but also for a detailed analysis of the recycled filament surface. This could help to expand the use of plastic recycling technologies in the manufacturing community. The availability of tools for possible texture analysis could also stimulate the growth of composite materials creation. The presented system can greatly enhance the user possibilities and serve as a starting point for a complete recycling control system that will regulate motor parameters to achieve the desired filament diameter with acceptable deviations and even control the extrusion rate on a printer to recover from filament irregularities.

AB Vitrimers represent a promising class of polymers that combine the reprocessability of thermoplastics with the stability of thermosets due to their dynamic covalent networks. However, the fabrication of vitrimer filaments suitable for additive manufacturing remains a significant challenge, limiting their widespread adoption. In this study, a vitrimer filament was successfully developed using an epoxidized ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate copolymer and a zinc ionomer. The filament was extruded at 150 degrees C to minimize premature cross-linking, maintaining a low gel content (similar to 20%) to ensure proper flowability during 3D printing. The optimized printing conditions (190 degrees C, 30 mm s-1) enabled the fabrication of complex structures while preserving processability. Post-curing at 150 degrees C for 60 min led to a cross-linked vitrimer network, as confirmed by gel content analysis, which increased from approximately 48% after printing to approximately 80% after curing. The printed vitrimer exhibited excellent mechanical stability, with stress-strain curves showing negligible differences between the original and recycled samples, highlighting its reprocessability. Furthermore, 4D printing capabilities were demonstrated through a shape memory experiment, where specimens programmed at 90 degrees C achieved close to 100% fixation and 100% recovery in a water bath. The plasticizing effect of water facilitated segmental mobility, enhancing recovery compared to dry conditions. This study not only advances the scalable production of vitrimer filaments but also establishes their potential for functional applications in self-healing, adaptive structures, and recyclable printed components. The combination of tunable mechanical properties, processability, and shape memory behavior positions this vitrimer system as a viable candidate for next-generation smart materials in additive manufacturing.

AB Researchers throughout the world extensively adopting recycling techniques in order to manage polymer waste. But hitherto, less work has been performed on fabrication of fused filaments based on secondary (2 degrees) recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer reinforced with industrial waste of Fe powder. In present study, efforts have been made on development of composite filaments for fused deposition modelling (FDM) technique of additive manufacturing by controlling different parameters like speed, temperature and load of twin-screw extruder using recycled ABS reinforced with Fe powder. Total nine composite filaments were prepared by taking 90% ABS and 10% Fe powder by weight. The maximum peak strength (32.82 MPa) of ABS + Fe based composite filament was observed at 15 kg (load), 225 degrees C (extrusion temperature) and 70 rpm (speed) whereas the maximum %BE (7.13%) was obtained at parametric settings of 10 kg, 245 degrees C and 70 rpm respectively. The observed mechanical and thermal properties of the composite filaments were analysed through porosity analysis, scanning electron microscopy characterization and differential scanning calorimeter.

AB In a world going through a plastic waste management catastrophe with serious environmental, health, social and economic consequences, the ideal step forward would be the creation of circular flows of material which allow for the materials to remain in the value-chain for as long as possible and completing multiple lifecycles. In the case of thermoplastics, a new recycling route is emerging, made possible by Material Extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX): distributed recycling. However, similar to what happens with mainstream recycling of these materials, the thermo-mechanical processes involved, as well as other factors such as exposure to UV-light, result in waste streams with degraded properties. This way, the possible range of applications and functionality of the polymers is reduced along with number of viable lifecycles. On this scope, the application of methods to control and modify the properties of the polymers, enhancing them or compensating for the degradation in a distributed recycling context, becomes important. Not only is this an emerging, less explored recycling route with great potential to complement the existing ones, but it also presents its own set of challenges and advantages to be explored. In this work, a systematic search methodology is followed to conduct a literature review on which the current practices on the modification and control of properties of parts produced from recycled or reprocessed thermoplastics through MEX are assessed. Research gaps and opportunities are presented from the discussion of the results. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB A considerable amount of powder residue is generated during the selective laser sintering (SLS) process. Processing the powder residue into filaments for extrusion-based additive manufacturing (EAM) provides an opportunity to recycle SLS residue without significantly reducing its value. In this study, the feasibility of using a milled carbon fiber (mCF)/recycled polyamide12 (rPA12) composite filament for EAM was demonstrated. A microscopic study on the morphology of mCF showed that mCF is a short and smooth fiber. The mCF did not significantly change the melting temperature, crystallization temperature or crystallinity of rPA12 as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). A morphological study on the fracture-surface of the composites revealed that there was moderate interfacial interaction between the mCF and PA12. Tensile strength, tensile modulus, flexural strength, flexural modulus and impact strength of rPA12 were improved by 35%, 163%, 61%, 138% and 23%, respectively with the addition of 30 wt.% mCF.

AB To effectively deal with the hazards posed by copper ions in wastewater. In this study, 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA)-modified graphene oxide (GO) printing inks were firstly prepared in a cellulose-based solution, followed by the use of sodium alginate (SA) to improve the rheological properties of the printing inks. Finally, three-dimensional hybrid network structures (DMSA-GO/CE) with excellent adsorption properties were prepared by direct ink writing (DIW) printing. Due to the supporting effect of cellulose, a well-developed pore network was formed inside the DMSA-GO/CE, which provided a faster transport channel and a larger storage space for the adsorption of copper ions. In addition, the introduction of -SH resulted in more abundant adsorption active sites for DMSA-GO/CE. The adsorption experiments showed that the maximum adsorption capacity of DMSA-GO/CE reached 250 mg/g at pH = 5.0 and 303.15 K, and the adsorption equilibrium was reached in 90 min. After five cycles, the removal rate of copper ions by DMSA-GO/CE only decreased by 13.5%, and the performance and structure remained stable. This superb adsorption capacity was not only attributed to the unique pore structure but also to the chelating effect of the -SH group introduced by DMSA. We performed dynamic adsorption column experiments, and the results derived from the Thomas model showed that the maximum adsorption saturation time was 3240 min. Therefore, the DMSA-GO/CE prepared by 3D printing can effectively alleviate the hazards caused by heavy metals, has the advantages of environmental friendliness and sustainable use, and has a broad application prospect in the field of green and efficient removal and recycling of heavy metals in wastewater.

AB Unlike subtractive manufacturing processes, by their own nature additive technologies offer the potential to reduce both raw material consumption and production waste. The positive impact of Additive Manufacturing on sustainability is more evident for those mass consumption products that are characterized by a short lifecycle. Nevertheless, in order to take full advantage of these technologies and let them achieve their full potential, a great change is needed in the behaviour and attitude of consumers. Compromises may be necessary to accommodate technological limitations, and customers may need to prioritize between functional and aesthetic product characteristics. The positive impact of additive manufacturing on sustainability is more evident for those mass consumption products that are characterized by a short lifecycle. The material flow and sustainability of 3D printing are described in this paper for the manufacturing of mobile case covers, and compared to those of mass production injection moulding.

AB Vat photopolymerization (VPP) 3D printing has gained significant attention for its ability to fabricate complex geometries with high resolution and excellent surface finish using relatively low-cost equipment. However, developing materials that combine mechanical robustness, geometric fidelity, and recyclability remains challenging. Here, we present a dual-curing vitrimeric acrylate/epoxy system that transitions from a highly deformable up to 80 % of strain in the intermediate state (ultimate tensile strength of 0.7 MPa) to a mechanically robust final state (ultimate tensile strength of 66 MPa) after thermal treatment. The system also supports effective repair via bonding protocols, recovering substantial mechanical integrity, thanks to the transesterification bond exchange. In spite of some shortcomings related to the irreversible changes in network structure upon thermal cycling, these results demonstrate a promising versatile platform for sustainable, durable, and repairable VPP components.

AB In this paper, a new combustor with an output of 5 t/h is designed based on a computational particle fluid dynamics (CPFD) model. The flow field simulation is combined with the combustion simulation to analyze the internal two-phase flow, temperature field, and combustion products. The combustor structure was optimized. The simulation results show that the recovery efficiency of the waste sand and the energy utilization of the combustor can be improved under the original structure. The sand bed has a significant effect on flow field characteristics. The increase in particle temperature in the combustor increases the efficiency of waste sand recovery by increasing the height of the sand bed by 50 mm. The utilization rate of natural gas is increased and the economic efficiency is improved. The feasibility of the CPFD method can simulate the flow field characteristics inside the combustor very effectively.

AB This paper studies the effect of various parameters on the effective thermal conductivity (lambda(eff)) of the geothermal pavement system when constructed using construction and demolition (C&D) materials. Recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) and recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) were utilized to experimentally model the geothermal pavement system, consisting of copper tubes to circulate water in the pavement and harness thermal energy. Numerical computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and discrete element method (DEM) methods were used to simulate the geothermal pavement system. Six samples of RAP and RCA aggregates with different particle size distributions were utilized to study the effect of important parameters in the geothermal pavement system. According to the results, coupled CFD-DEM approach could simulate the heat transfer mechanism in geothermal pavement compared to the results of the CFD simulation. The results indicated that increasing porosity would decrease lambda(eff). The decrease rate depended on the gravel content of the sample where samples with a higher gravel content experienced a higher rate of decrease. Also, simulation results showed that increasing the gravel content could increase the value of lambda(eff). Increasing the axial stress resulted in an increase in the value of coordination number (CN) and lambda(eff). Moreover, comparing the thermal power and contact distributions indicated that the morphology of the heat conduction was the same as the contact network distribution. To study the effect of the particle shape on lambda(eff), a novel approach was used that comprised of 3D scanning and printing real particle shape of RCA aggregates by thermochromic material. Simulated assemblies with DEM were verified using 3D printed particles. The effect of aspect ratio (AR) on lambda(eff) was studied which indicated that increasing AR would increase lambda(eff). Decreasing AR to one, on the other hand, increased the time needed to reach the steady state.

AB Additive manufacturing with vat photopolymerization (VP) as an emerging manufacturing method addresses various goals for enhanced sustainability including waste reduction, dematerialization, and the customization of intricate and complex 3D parts. Unsaturated polyesters (UPEs) recently gained attention as a sustainable material source for lithographic additive manufacturing. While previous methods demonstrated the printability of UPE-based resins, these studies lack the solvent-free approach demonstrated herein. Furthermore, the effective depolymerization of polyester thermosets has remained relatively unexplored. This report demonstrates structure-property relationships and subsequent solvent-free VP of UPEs with PEGDA-575 as a reactive diluent with effective depolymerization of polyester thermosets through base-catalyzed methanolysis.

AB PLAID is an experimental interior art installation that brings together Silicon Valley's agricultural history with the region's contemporary technological focus through the innovative use of waste stream materials. The installation demonstrates how post-industrial remnants can be redefined as "local" vernacular building materials for 21st-century interior design and architecture. The PLAID structure comprises 300 recycled glass rods from the bankrupt solar company Solyndra, filled with local agricultural materials including wine and natural dyes made from regional crops, connected by biodegradable 3D-printed nodes. This research explores the potential for industrial waste to function as vernacular building materials while questioning traditional definitions of locality in contemporary construction practices. The project establishes a methodology for combining high-tech fabrication with regional agricultural resources to create luminous spatial assemblies that bridge Silicon Valley's past and present. Future iterations will incorporate geological materials including salt, limestone, and wood waste from regional sources, expanding the vocabulary of local materials available for architectural applications.

AB Recycled duck bones (DBs) and fish shells were processed into natural derivatives. Through innovative design, these natural derivatives were then combined with biocompatible polymer to create a new type of ecofriendly filament suitable for three-dimensional (3D) printing of scaffolds for bone regeneration. The DBs and fish shells were thermally processed to produce DB-derived hydroxyapatite (HA) and fish shell-derived Ca(OH)2 (TAS), respectively. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL), HA, and TAS were combined and fabricated into new composite filaments, which were then transformed into scaffolds using 3D printing technology. The structure and antibacterial behaviors of the obtained composite scaffolds were studied. Alone, PCL showed no bacterial inhibition. MHA (a mix of 4, 8, 12, 16 wt%-HA and 0.8 wt% TAS) was added to PCL to form a PCL/MHA composite material, which significantly improved the functional properties of PCL and enhanced cell attachment and proliferation. The Ca(OH)2 content of TAS was responsible for the antibacterial effect. The PCL/MHA composites were porous and displayed enhanced osteoblast proliferation in vitro. The osteoblast cell population do not affected when cultured on the PCL/HA and PCL/MHA series composites according to cell cycle distribution analysis. The surfaces of the various PCL/HA and PCL/MHA composites showed elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus compounds when exposed to simulated body fluids. Calcium and phosphate ions were rapidly deposited on PCL/HA and PCL/MHA composite scaffolds in osteoblasts according to the cell mineralization assay. Our findings suggest great potential of the PCL/HA and PCL/MHA composite scaffolds in bone tissue engineering applications.

AB In this study, the performance of novel 3D printed spacers was investigated for scaling control in direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD). The spacers, designed as triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS), were tested under calcium sulfate scaling conditions, with brine recycling leading to continuous feed concentration increase. The DCMD experiments were done using 1900 mg/L calcium sulfate as the starting feed solution at feed and permeate inlet temperatures of 65 and 35 degrees C, respectively, and feed and permeate flow velocity of 0.1 m/s. The best performing TPMS spacer, the tCLP design, resulted in a 50% flux increase (47 L m(-2).h-(1)) in comparison to a commercial spacer, but at the expense of increased pressure drop (0.52 bar vs. 0.04 bar). The membrane in contact with the commercial spacer had higher sealant deposition than those in contact with the TPMS spacers. On the other hand, the surface micro-roughness of the TPMS spacers contributed to increased sealant deposition on the spacer itself. The calcium sulfate sealant deposition patterns on the fouled membranes were visualized by utilizing alizarin red S (ARS) staining, which was applied herein for the first time in characterizing membrane fouling. The ARS stains proved that the spacer contact region functioned as the scaling initiation sites. A hybrid spacer design combining two TPMS architectures, tCLP and Gyroid, was then investigated, which resulted in high flux performance on par with tCLP, but at a lower pressure drop penalty. The results highlight the prospective applications of 3D printed TPMS designs to control scaling in MD.

AB This study investigates the feasibility of using bio-waste materials as natural fibers in printability and flexural properties of 3D concrete printing (3DCP). Two sections of small- and large-scale experimental programs were conducted using natural fibers erived from bio-waste of date palm, cob skin, banana, pineapple leaf, and coconut fibers with different volume fractions of 0.1%, 0.15%, 0.2%, and 0.25%. Different tests were conducted in the small-scale program, including flowability, extrudability, buildability, open time, compressive strength, tensile strength, and flexural strength. After achieving an optimum percentage of natural fibers, 3DCP beams were tested under flexural loading. The optimum fiber volume fraction of 0.2% was determined through an experimental program evaluating fresh and mechanical properties, balancing enhanced strength with printability. Findings showed that using recycled bio-fibers enhanced the strength of both cast and 3DCP samples. Incorporating 0.2% by volume of date palm, cob skin, banana, pineapple leaf, or coconut fibers individually led to average increases of 26% in compressive strength, 40% in tensile strength, and 20% in flexural strength, and an average decrease of 10% in flowability and 8% in extrudability compared to mixtures devoid of fibers. Furthermore, the fibers contributed to maintaining the shape and stability of the printed filaments-nonetheless, higher fiber content impaired flowability and extrudability. Future research could explore hybrid fiber systems, advanced additives, and long-term durability to further enhance the sustainability and scalability of fiber-reinforced 3DCP.

AB Conventional thermosets are infusible and insoluble covalently cross-linked polymers that are difficult to recycle and reuse when discarded. Recent years have witnessed the development of the closed-loop recycling of novel thermosets as well as their applications in composites, 3D printing materials, etc. through innovations in degradation techniques and reversible chemistries (or dynamic chemistries). In this review, the approaches for achieving the closed-loop recycling of novel thermosets and their downstream materials are divided into two categories. One is to hydrolyze the thermosets in an acidic, alkaline or catalyst solution, and then recover the monomers or oligomers, which can be reused to prepare thermosets or their functional materials. Another is to de-cross-link and re-cross-link the thermosets through the exchange reaction of dynamic bonds. In recent years, various cleavable (or dynamic) bonds such as ester bonds, acetal linkages, Schiff bases, disulfide bonds, hexahydrotriazine structures, boronic ester bonds, and so on have been developed for the preparation of closed-loop recyclable thermosets, and their closed-loop recycling mechanisms have also been fully demonstrated. By adopting the strategy of closed-loop recycling through hydrolysis, the recovered thermosets have the same structure and properties as those of the original resin. However, the degradation process strongly depends on the wettability of the resin, the pH of the solution or the catalyst, and how to improve monomer recovery (whether it can reach similar to 100%) remains a challenge. When the thermosets are closed-loop recycled through a dynamic reaction, the recovery rate is ideally 100%; however, recycling must be carried out at high temperature, and the performance of the recovered resin will inevitably be poorer compared with that of the original thermosets.

AB With the increasing consumption of non renewable resources such as oil, the traditional polymer manufacturing industry that relies on fossil resources is facing unprecedented challenges. The design, synthesis, and recycling of renewable and environmentally friendly bio-based polymers as alternatives to petroleum based polymers have become hot topics in research and industrial fields. Biomass has been used as a raw material to design and synthesize closed-loop recyclable polymers, which is of great significance in addressing the waste of resources and negative impact on the environment in the traditional polymer preparation process. This review summarized recent advances in the design, synthesis, and properties of closed-loop recyclable bio-based polymers, focusing on the sustainability and recyclability of bio-based materials, followed by a brief discussion of the potential applications of closed-loop recyclable bio-based polymers in emerging applications such as 3D printing and friction electric nanogenerators. In addition, perspectives and recommendations for future research on closedloop recyclable bio-based polymers were presented.

AB This paper evaluates solid particle erosion (SPE) performance of samples produced via selective laser sintering (SLS) using fully recycled PA 3200 GF material, following ASTM G76-95 standards. For this purpose, six samples (30*30*3 mm3) were printed at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees in x-y and x-z planes with a 100-mu m layer thickness. SPE tests examined erosion at distinct impact angles (30 degrees, 45 degrees, 60 degrees, 90 degrees) and pressures (1, 2, 3 bars). Results showed higher particle velocities reduced erosion resistance, where 45 degrees x-y plane samples demonstrated superior resistance (erosion rates: 0.050, 0.100, 0.220 mg/g under 1, 2, 3 bars, respectively). The 30 degrees impact angle caused maximum erosion, while 90 degrees had the least. Samples positioned horizontally in the x-y plane were most sensitive to impact angles, with 10% higher erosion sensitivity than others. The study highlights how printing direction significantly affects SPE performance in SLS.

AB The benefits related to the use of 3-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP) have been recognized worldwide. Key advantages include cost and time-related reductions in addition to reduced labour and maintenance requirements. However, due to this technology's novelty, many challenges must be addressed before it can be fully integrated into the construction industry. This paper reviews the phenomenon of shrinkage and the consequent shrinkage cracking. Due to the low volume of aggregates, hence high paste and fines content, and early exposure, 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is more likely to experience large shrinkage strains in comparison to cast concrete, to an extent where elements are at risk of cracking. Other factors, like early exposure, excessive plastic shrinkage and curing regimes also contribute to cracking. The reviewed literature shows that reported shrinkage strains of 3DCP elements are significantly larger than those of cast concrete. In addition, environmental and curing conditions, mix proportions, admixtures and specimen sizes have been found to influence the rate and magnitude of shrinkage. Variance in shrinkage strains between studies is partially attributed to the varying open time definition and difference between shrinkage measurement methods. This paper concludes that a standardized testing method should be developed to measure plastic and drying shrinkage for 3DCP elements to enable readers to easily compare the reported shrinkage strains from respective authors and develop a shrinkage database to identify governing factors and design guidelines.

AB Conventional epoxy polymers are thermo-set and difficult to recycle and reuse. In this study, a series of linear thermoplastic epoxy polymers (EPx) with shape memory properties were prepared by using a bifunctional monoamine diglycolamine (DGA) as a curing agent and an equivalent amount of bifunctional rigid epoxy resin (E-51) and bifunctional flexible epoxy resin (polypropylenglycol diglycidyl ether, PPGDGE) in a bulk polymerization reaction. The results showed that these samples can fully react under the curing process of, 60 degrees C/2 h, followed by 80 degrees C/2 h, followed by 120 degrees C/2 h. The introduction of different contents of PPGDGE can adjust the T-g of the material to adapt to different environmental requirements, and can significantly increase the fracture strain of the material and improve its micro-phase separation structure. Thus, R-f of the material is close to 100%, and R-r is increased from 87.98% to 97.76%. Importantly, this linear chain structure allows the material to be easily recycled and reprocessed by dissolving or melting, and also means the material shows potential for 3D printing or other thermoplastic remolding.

AB Despite the large use of composites for industrial applications, their end-of-life management is still an open issue for manufacturing, especially in the wind energy sector. Additive manufacturing technology has been emerging as a solution, enhancing circular economy models, and using recycled composites for glass fiber-reinforced polymers is spreading as a new additive manufacturing trend. Nevertheless, their mechanical properties are still not comparable to pristine materials. The purpose of this paper is to examine the additive re-manufacturing of end-of-life glass fiber composites with mechanical performances that are comparable to virgin glass fiber-reinforced materials. Through a systematic characterization of the recyclate, requirements of the filler for the liquid deposition modeling process were identified. Printability and material surface quality of different formulations were analyzed using a low-cost modified 3D printer. Two hypothetical design concepts were also manufactured to validate the field of application. Furthermore, an understanding of the mechanical behavior was accomplished by means of tensile tests, and the results were compared with a benchmark formulation with virgin glass fibers. Mechanically recycled glass fibers show the capability to substitute pristine fillers, unlocking their use for new fields of application.

AB In the past two decades, studies have been reported using biocompatible polylactic acid (PLA) based functional prototypes as orthodontic splints. However, less has been reported on reinforcing laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) waste recycled powder of 17-4-precipitated hardened (PH) stainless steel (SS) in the PLA matrix for customized mechanical and morphological properties. This study demonstrates the fabrication of 97 (wt.%) of PLA reinforced with 3 (wt.%) 17-4-PH-SS-based functional prototypes (selected based on melt flow index (MFI) observations) for orthodontic applications. The filament of phi 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm was fabricated using a single screw extruder (SSE) at the screw temperature of 190 degrees C and screw speed of 6 rpm. The tensile and compressive specimens were fabricated using fused filament fabrication (FFF). The general linear model (GLM) for processing on FFF suggested that the best input parameters for the fabrication of 97% PLA reinforced with 3%-17-4-PH-SS are nozzle temperature (NT) of 210 degrees C, infill pattern (IP) cross, and infill percentage (IP) of 40%. The results are supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The results indicate a significant improvement in the mechanical and morphological properties of the PLA-17-4-PH-SS composite-based functional prototypes for orthodontic applications.

AB In the recent few years, fused filament fabrication technique have seen extensively used to produce complex-geometry objects. However, the relatively restricted range of 3D printable biocomposites decelerated its adoption in the biomedical sector as a conventional manufacturing technique. In this method, the introduction of biofillers with unique properties to produce high performance composites as printing feedstocks are increasingly recommended. The interest in using eco-friendly fillers from waste as reinforcing agents for producing lightweight and low-cost poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites is recently increased. In this work, a series of PLA biocomposites filled with calcined seashell (CSh) particles have been prepared by melt mixing technique using a twin-screw extruder, and characterized by different morphological, thermal, and mechanical methods. The visco-elastic parameters have been determined for these biocomposites to optimize their processing conditions. The morphological analysis revealed a homogenous dispersion of CSh fillers within the biopolymeric matrix, which was responsible for the enhancement of the various mechanical properties. Where, by adding 10 wt% of treated CSh, the tensile modulus and strength were significantly increased from 183.8 +/- 4.7 MPa and 29.81 +/- 1.8 MPa to 241.9 +/- 63 MPa and 49.06 +/- 8.87 MPa, respectively, compared to the virgin PLA. In addition, respected to PLA matrix, the compressive moduli of the printed specimens of PLA/5CSh and PLA/10CSh biocomposite filaments exhibited improvements of 5% and 14%, respectively. Moreover, the thermal analysis showed a marked improvement in the thermal stability of the elaborated biocomposites, where the degradation temperature (Td50) have been upgraded by 4 degrees C for the biocomposite containing 10 wt% of CSh bio-filler. These outstanding properties of PLA/CSh composites make them very suitable for 3D printing applications in the biomedical field.

AB Polyolefins are semi-crystalline thermoplastic polymers known for their good mechanical properties, low production cost, and chemical resistance. They are amongst the most commonly used plastics, and many polyolefin grades are regarded as engineering polymers. The two main additive manufacturing techniques that can be used to fabricate 3D-printed parts are fused filament fabrication and selective laser sintering. Polyolefins, like polypropylene and polyethylene, can, in principle, be processed with both these techniques. However, the semi-crystalline nature of polyolefins adds complexity to the use of additive manufacturing methods compared to amorphous polymers. First, the crystallization process results in severe shrinkage upon cooling, while the processing temperature and cooling rate affect the mechanical properties and mesoscopic structure of the fabricated parts. In addition, for ultra-high-molecular weight polyolefins, limited chain diffusion is a major obstacle to achieving proper adhesion between adjunct layers. Finally, polyolefins are typically apolar polymers, which reduces the adhesion of the 3D-printed part to the substrate. Notwithstanding these difficulties, it is clear that the successful processing of polyolefins via additive manufacturing techniques would enable the fabrication of high-end engineering products with enormous design flexibility. In addition, additive manufacturing could be utilized for the increased recycling of plastics. This manuscript reviews the work that has been conducted in developing experimental protocols for the additive manufacturing of polyolefins, presenting a comparison between the different approaches with a focus on the use of polyethylene and polypropylene grades. This review is concluded with an outlook for future research to overcome the current challenges that impede the addition of polyolefins to the standard palette of materials processed through additive manufacturing.

AB Vat photopolymerization (VPP)-based 3D printing enables the rapid fabrication of complex, high-precision structures. However, printing intricate features such as overhangs and internal cavities often requires support structures that are difficult to remove and may damage the part surface. To address this, a fast-dissolving, recyclable thiol-ene photopolymer was developed for use as a support material in multi-material VPP printing. The study explores how surface-area-to-volume ratio and grayscale projection influence the dissolution and recyclability of these supports, aiming to minimise post-processing time. Porous gyroid architectures were incorporated into the support structures, achieving dissolution rates up to 50 times faster than solid counterparts. Even after multiple recycling cycles, the thiol-ene resin retains its photopolymerization performance and mechanical properties. This recyclable resin enables the production of intricate geometries - such as microfluidic channels, cactus-inspired spines, and interlocked da Vinci drones - without compromising quality. The results demonstrate that optimally designed porous supports, with high surface-area-to-volume ratios, not only reduce the need for manual post-processing but also enhance sustainability through material reuse. This design approach streamlines the VPP workflow by facilitating faster support removal, reducing cycle times, and lowering both production costs and environmental impact - ultimately enabling more efficient, sustainable, and high-resolution 3D printing.

AB Plastics have emerged as one of the essential materials present on the planet. However, its accumulation can negatively impact the environment if not disposed of properly. To counter this issue, the 'Circular Economy' is one such economic growth model with one of the objectives of using plastic resources efficiently. Several plastic recycling methodologies have been derived, out of which Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is one of them. The main objective of this study aims to form an optimal link between two different areas of knowledge domains: plastic recycling and additive manufacturing. A scientometric analysis has been conducted to measure the former knowledge domains mentioned to accomplish this goal. From the results, the Scopus database yields 1452 relevant publications between 2013 and 2021. The results suggest that Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is the most used AM technology on recycled plastics. Hence, the review targets the FDM process in the context of plastic recycling. A critical review has been done, which shows the material characterization of recycled polymers in AM. This is followed by an in-depth analysis of the FDM technology, including discussions on influencing parameters of this process. The following results present the multi-material mixing of plastics and Direct FDM systems and their relevance in plastic recycling. These two areas create opportunities to increase the variety of feedstock materials that can be 3D printed. Lastly, the authors have proposed some future directions based on the literature review done in this work.

AB Graphene oxide (GO) was a promising adsorbent for the contaminants removal in the wastewater. However, the nanoscale GO with the properties of easy agglomeration and difficult to separate in the solution severely restricted its widespread practical application. Therefore, a monolithic and structured GO bulk was prepared by a 3D printing method and used as adsorbent for the removal of Cu2+ ions. The rheological property and printability of the ink, as well as the mechanical property and adsorption capacity of the printed GO bulk were investigated. It was found that the optimal ratio of GO: sodium alginate was 1.5:2.0 with the compressive strength was 6.23 MPa. Batch experiments exhibited that the Cu2+ sorption was an endothermic reaction and the maximum adsorption capacity calculated by Langmuir model was 179.32 mg/g at 303.15 K. Kinetics, FTIR and XPS analysis revealed that the mechanism of Cu2+ adsorption was mainly a chemical dominated process involving the oxygen functional groups contained in GO and sodium alginate. The desorption and regeneration test results indicated that the printed GO bulk was an ideal adsorbent for heavy metals removal in real applications due to its excellent adsorption capacity and convenient recycling performance.

AB Glass was introduced as an additive to filaments used for the manufacturing of composite materials, employed by Additive Manufacturing applications. Glass accounts for a large waste electric and electronic equipment (WEEE) percentage, and its recovery and recycling can lead to the production of sustainable composite materials. In this work, poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/commercially available silicon oxide composite filaments were manufactured and their structural, thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties were assessed. Scanning Electron Microscopy confirmed the 1:2 ratio of silicon: oxygen, along with the relatively low adhesion between the filler and the matrix. Differential Scanning Calorimetry presented steady glass transition and melting temperatures of composites, whereas a crystallization temperature of 10% wt. and a crystallinity of 15% wt. composite slightly increased. Rheological analysis showcased that the viscosity of the composite filaments decreased compared to PLA (10-100 compared to 300-400 Pa<middle dot>s), with a more shear-thinning behavior. Dynamic mechanical analysis exhibited increased elastic, flexural moduli, and flexural strength of composites (up to 16, 23, and 11%, respectively), whereas tensile strength and elongation decreased. The affordability of raw materials (with the future introduction of recycled ones) and the minimal processing steps can lead to the potential scaling up of the study.

AB The legislature determines the recycled and waste contents in fabrication processes to ensure more sustainable production. PLA's mechanical recycling and reuse are limited due to the performance decrease caused by thermal or hydrolytic instability. Our concept introduces an upcycling route involving PLA depolymerization using propylene glycol as a reactant, followed by the methacrylation, assuring the liquid systems' curability provided by radical polymerization. PLA-containing curable systems were studied from a rheological and thermomechanical viewpoint. The viscosity levels varied from 33 to 3911 mPa<middle dot>s at 30 degrees C, giving a wide capability potential. The best system reached 2240 MPa storage modulus, 164.1 degrees C glass-transition temperature, and 145.6 degrees C heat-resistant index, competitive values to commercial systems. The printability was verified for all of the systems. Eventually, our concept led to SLA resin production containing PLA waste content up to 51 wt %.

AB Wind energy production is rapidly growing in the United States and is expected to continue increasing as more and larger wind turbines are installed. To support these taller and heavier onshore turbines, new foundations must be designed and manufactured. One proposed method of reducing the total amount of concrete and steel in spread foundations is to utilize additive manufacturing to enable more material-efficient designs. To compare these additively manufacturing-enabled designs to conventional foundation designs, this study performs a life cycle impact assessment of four ultra-tall wind turbine foundations: two foundations using 78-MPa 3D printed stay-in-place concrete formwork cast with 35-MPa ready-mix concrete with reinforcements, and two conventional foundations cast entirely out of 35-MPa concrete with reinforcements. The life cycle assessment investigates the environmental impacts of four different stages, including materials production, transportation, construction, and end-of-life. The materials production stage is found to dominate the life cycle results, contributing over 97% of the total CO2 emissions and over 88% of the fossil fuel depletion for each foundation. Compared to the conventional designs, the Short Flat Ribbed Beam foundation with 3D printed formwork has 22.4% lower CO2 emissions and 28.3% lower fossil fuel depletion than the Circular foundation, and 2.0% higher CO2 and 5.9% lower fossil fuel depletion compared to the Tapered foundation. Parametric studies indicate that reducing cement content and increasing recycled content in printed concrete can significantly reduce the overall life cycle impacts of the foundations.

AB During the ceramic photocuring 3D printing process, the penetration ability of incident light is hindered by the extinction effects of ceramic powders in ceramic slurry. This limitation in light penetration negatively impacts printing efficiency, especially in ceramic slurries with high solid contents. In this work, an in-situ photothermal dual crosslinking strategy, which capitalizes on the combined benefits of near-infrared photothermal energy, was proposed to realize precise and efficient direct ink writing of high solids ceramic slurries. The in-situ curing of ceramic slurries with an alumina content of up to 90 wt% (74.5 vol%) was successfully achieved by integrating photochemical and photothermal crosslinking strategies to recycle excess heat to enhance the energy utilization of near-infrared light. Under near-infrared irradiation (538.25 W/cm2, 3 s), the high solids ceramic photothermal dual curing slurry achieved a curing depth of 2.79 mm, which improved the printing rate and printing throughput compared with the photocuring slurry (2.34 mm) and the thermocuring slurry (0.98 mm). The sintered samples showed a sinter shrinkage of 8.85 % and relative density of 95.08 %. This method has great potential for application in the manufacturing of thick composite materials and high solid content slurry printing.

AB The study investigates the potential of 3D printing as an eco-friendly and cost-effective method to repurpose waste fabrics into valuable products. It explores the use of bio-inspired structures in 3D printing to gain insights into sandwich structures' mechanical properties and laser ablation characteristics. By incorporating natural skeleton designs such as nacreous and foliated hierarchies and industrial waste material (KF), the research aims to enhance mechanical performance, laser ablation characteristics, and sustainable waste management. The study demonstrates the synergistic application of two distinct additive manufacturing techniques (FDM and DIW) at the micron scale to create nacre-inspired sheet, columnar, and laminated structures, allowing for manipulation of rigid and pliant material phases within KF waste. The featured architectures are found in the Mollusk Seashell, which improves toughness and strength simultaneously for high-end mechanical applications. During impact loading, the study highlights the enhanced energy dissipation and delamination properties of foliated structures compared to nacre-like ones. The research emphasizes that the mass loss of NS + KF comprises the lowest value compared to NC + KF, then FL + KF, and pristine + KF at 375 mJ for 210 s. Ultimately, the findings hold promise for applications in aerospace, defense, automobile, thermal management, laser ablation, and structural components due to the demand for waste utilization, accessibility, environmental responsibility, and green manufacturing practices.

AB PurposeThis paper introduces binder injection, a novel hybrid process combining elements of material extrusion and binder jetting. The research paper aims to establish binder injection as a versatile, scalable and cost-effective method for producing geometrically complex parts using a diverse range of powdered materials, including low-cost and recycled options.Design/methodology/approachA modified delta 3D printer was adapted for binder injection additive manufacturing (AM). Experimental investigations were conducted to evaluate the effects of binder injection rates, nozzle-powder interactions and self-intersecting toolpaths. A wide range of binder-powder combinations was tested, and post-processing methods were applied to enhance part properties. Theoretical models predicting track geometry were developed and validated against experimental data.FindingsBinder injection demonstrated high compatibility with varied materials, achieving build rates comparable to or exceeding other AM processes. The developed model accurately predicted track geometry under specific conditions. Post-processing methods significantly improved mechanical properties, with compressive strengths increasing by over 250% for certain materials. The process proved robust, enabling self-intersecting toolpaths without quality degradation.Research limitations/implicationsThis study focused on adhesive and reactive binders, leaving scope to explore thermal, dissolving and displacing binders further. Future research should investigate multi-binder systems, smaller nozzle sizes for higher resolution and scalability through parallel printing.Practical implicationsBinder injection's compatibility with low-cost and recycled powders suggests it potential as a sustainable method for producing large-scale parts, such as architectural elements and furniture. Post-processing methods further expand its applicability to high-strength applications.Originality/valueThis paper presents a novel AM process with industrial potential. The versatility and material inclusivity of binder injection suggest it has promise as a novel direction in sustainable manufacturing research.

AB Eco-friendly materials are increasingly important for several applications due to growing environmental concerns, including in robotics and medicine. Within robotics, silicone-based soft grippers are recently developed owing to their high adaptability and versatility allowing to deal with various objects. However, the soft grippers are difficult to recycle and may cause increased environmental impact. Here biodegradable soft pneumatic actuators reinforced by cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) distributed in a matrix of gelatin are presented. The results show that adding CNF enables 3D printability and provides tunable mechanical properties for the actuators. The actuator performance, with a bending angle of 80 degrees and a blocked force of 0.1 N at 15 kPa, is comparable to state-of-the-art mold-casted pneumatic actuators from conventional silicone materials while being exclusively composed of non-toxic, biodegradable materials and fabricated by additive manufacturing techniques. Moreover, the actuators exhibit self-healing ability and enable object manipulation when formed in a gripper configuration. The mold-free approach and achieved functionalities establish new opportunities for soft-robotics, across various fields including healthcare, packaging, or even environmental monitoring. The performance of the gripper shows that CNF can be used in the creation of eco-friendly high-performance soft robots and contribute to the advancement of sustainable and green robotics.

AB Protein crystallography has significantly advanced in recent years, with in situ data collection, in which crystals are placed in the X-ray beam within their growth medium, being a major point of focus. In situ methods eliminate the need to harvest crystals, a previously unavoidable drawback, particularly for often small membrane-protein crystals. Here, we present a protocol for the high-throughput in situ X-ray screening of and data collection from soluble and membrane-protein crystals at room temperature (20-25 degrees C) and under cryogenic conditions. The Mylar in situ method uses Mylar-based film sandwich plates that are inexpensive, easy to make, and compatible with automated imaging, and that show very low background scattering. They support crystallization in microbatch and vapor-diffusion modes, as well as in lipidic cubic phases (LCPs). A set of 3D-printed holders for differently sized patches of Mylar sandwich films makes the method robust and versatile, allows for storage and shipping of crystals, and enables automated mounting at synchrotrons, as well as goniometer-based screening and data collection. The protocol covers preparation of in situ plates and setup of crystallization trials; 3D printing and assembly of holders; opening of plates, isolation of film patches containing crystals, and loading them onto holders; basic screening and data-collection guidelines; and unloading of holders, as well as reuse and recycling of them. In situ plates are prepared and assembled in 1 h; holders are 3D-printed and assembled in <= 90 min; and an in situ plate is opened, and a film patch containing crystals is isolated and loaded onto a holder in 5 min.

AB Filament shredders and extruders greatly expand the additive manufacturing material selection. By using recycled filaments, waste and future costs can be efficiently cut while creating in-house, customizable, filaments. Testing mixed filaments is necessary to determine the physical and chemical benefits and costs of mixing filaments. This work aims to characterize mixtures of Polylactic Acid and Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene. Mixtures were characterized through tensile strength testing and differential scanning calorimetry of extruded filament samples. The tested mixed filaments were found to be comparable to purchased filaments, with drastic increases in elasticity and decreases in torsional strength and tensile strength. This study shows that while possible to produce mixed filaments, and in spite of their chemical similarities, mixtures are not comparable in physical strength to pure filaments.

AB This review investigates recent progress in the field of PLA-based conductive composites for 3D printing. First, it introduces PLA as a biodegradable thermoplastic polymer, describing its processing and recycling methods and highlighting its environmental advantages over conventional polymers. In order to evaluate its printability, PLA is briefly compared to other commonly used thermoplastics in additive manufacturing. The review then examines the incorporation of conductive fillers such as carbon black, carbon nanotubes, graphene, and metal particles into the PLA matrix, with a particular focus on the percolation threshold and its effect on conductivity. Critical challenges such as filler dispersion, agglomeration, and conductivity anisotropy are also highlighted. Recent results are summarized to identify promising formulations that combine improved electrical performance with acceptable mechanical integrity, while also emphasizing the structural and morphological characteristics that govern these properties. Finally, potential applications in the fields of electronics, biomedicine, energy, and electromagnetic shielding are discussed. From an overall perspective, the review highlights that while PLA-based conductive composites show great potential for sustainable functional materials, further progress is needed to improve reproducibility, optimize processing parameters, and ensure reliable large-scale applications.

AB This is the second of a two-part study in which we explore the concept of batch chromatography with recycle lag, concluding with the design, construction, and experimental validation of a prototype-an eluate recycling device (ERD)-that embodies the physical realization of this concept. The ERD implements an approximate "first in, first out" method of organizing and manipulating the to-be-recycled fractions of eluate collected from the chromatography column, where the oldest (first) amount fluid, or 'head' of the fraction, is the first to exit and be recycled back to the column. Moreover, the apparatus is simple to set up in particular in view of large-scale applications. Here we detail the construction of the ERD and assembly of a setup to interconnect the ERD and a chromatography column. Through the coordinated operation of two-way valves and two-position six-port switching valves it is possible to implement a diverse set of configurations or operating modes interconnecting the chromatography column and the ERD. The setup is validated experimentally with success using the separation of a nucleoside mixture by reversed phase chromatography as a model problem. It is also shown that by redesigning the fluid distributor using 3D printing technology the ERD performance can be improved. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Completely sustainable triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) with bio-based raw materials, green synthesis, resource-saving processing, durable mechanical and electrical performance, facile recycling, and degradation properties are highly desired for green energy harvesting and wearable electronics, but their preparation remains a challenge. This study develops bio-based vitrimers combining green synthesis, excellent elasticity, biodegradability, and recyclability to address this challenge. A salt-assisted three-dimensional (3D) printing strategy is developed to fabricate mechanically robust TENGs with hierarchical porous structures. The triboelectric contact between the surfaces and external triboelectric materials as well as that of the internal hierarchical pore's wall contributes to the excellent electrical output performance. The resultant TENGs could be easily recycled into different forms by light-assisted fabrication to extend their lifetime. The main part of discarded TENGs shows facile degradation under benign conditions without negative influence on the environment, while the high-value conductive fillers can be readily recycled. Overall, this work presents a new paradigm for completely sustainable TENGs, which will inspire the development of sustainable electronic devices.

AB Auxetic structures showcase notable properties such as high indentation resistance, shear stiffness, fracture toughness, and acoustic energy absorption. Recent advancements in additive manufacturing have facilitated the creation of complex auxetic designs, but there has been less emphasis on developing new materials. This study focuses on using recycled iron powders mixed with biodegradable polymers by using the solution casting method to create sustainable, 3D-printable materials for energy absorption applications. This research involved examining a 2D re-entrant structure, evaluating the effects of varying iron powder concentrations in the polymer. The analyses included thermogravimetric analyses, differential scanning calorimetry, and microstructural examination, alongside compression tests to assess strength and absorption capabilities. The most effective 3D-printed composite, containing 10% iron powders, demonstrated a substantial improvement in specific energy absorption (SEA of 2.051 kJ/kg compared to neat PLA with an SEA of 0.160 kJ/kg) and exhibited favorable mechanical and thermal properties. The TGA showed that adding iron powder reduced PLA's onset degradation temperature from 340 degrees C to 310 degrees C, 295 degrees C, and 270 degrees C for 5%, 10%, and 15% iron, respectively, confirming iron's catalytic effect on PLA degradation. The DSC analysis showed that adding iron powder increased the degree of crystallinity from 5.63% for pure PLA to 5.77%, 6.79%, and 6.91% for 5%, 10%, and 15% iron, respectively, indicating iron's role as a nucleation agent. These results highlight the potential of novel iron/PLA 2D re-entrant composites for energy-absorbent applications, emphasizing sustainability and cost-effectiveness.

AB Background: Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly expanding new technology involving challenges to occupational health. Here, metal exposure in an AM facility with large-scale metallic component production was investigated during two consecutive years with preventive actions in between.
   Methods: Gravimetric analyzes measured airborne particle concentrations, and filters were analyzed for metal content. In addition, concentrations of airborne particles <300 nm were investigated. Particles from recycled powder were characterized. Biomonitoring of urine and dermal contamination among AM operators, office personnel, and welders was performed.
   Results: Total and inhalable dust levels were almost all below occupational exposure limits, but inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry showed that AM operators had a significant increase in cobalt exposure compared with welders. Airborne particle concentrations (<300 nm) showed transient peaks in the AM facility but were lower than those of the welding facility. Particle characterization of recycled powder showed fragmentation and condensates enriched in volatile metals. Biomonitoring showed a nonsignificant increase in the level of metals in urine in AM operators. Dermal cobalt and a trend for increasing urine metals during Workweek Year 1, but not in Year 2, indicated reduced exposure after preventive actions.
   Conclusion: Gravimetric analyses showed low total and inhalable dust exposure in AM operators. However, transient emission of smaller particles constitutes exposure risks. Preventive actions implemented by the company reduced the workers' metal exposure despite unchanged emissions of particles, indicating a need for careful design and regulation of the AM environments. It also emphasizes the need for relevant exposure markers and biomonitoring of health risks. (C) 2019 Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB Photocatalyst with complicated 3D structures for force resistance has aroused extensive attention to solve agglomeration and recyclability, and flexible fabrication can be effectively realized by catalyst anchoring. Here, a novel MoS2 @Cu(OH)(2) composite was inspired by Green Hairstreak wings for the enhanced photocatalytic and mechanical properties while the interface capacity of MoS2 was controlled after printing the bio-structural metamaterial of minimal surface. The hierarchical pore structure of the macroscopic framework, mesoscopic pore optimization and microscopic nanoneedles achieved high porosity of 81.42% and a specific surface area of up to 89.34 m2 g(-1) for abundant anchor sites. Compared with pure MoS2, the photodegradation efficiency of the MoS2 on Diamond support increased by 1.4 times because the constructed heterojunctions enhanced the separation efficiency of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. The 3D structural photocatalytic metamaterial maintained an ideal efficiency of 85.42% after recycling ten times. An ultra-high strength of 54.07 MPa was obtained from Diamond support with a modulus of 5.28 GPa. And the simulation of light irradiation proved that the minimal surface structure would not block the light path to the catalyst surface. The proposed strategy offers a new perspectivity of efficient coupling photocatalysts and minimal surface support for large-scale industrial applications.

DE fused deposition modeling; polylactic acid; filament; design of
   experiments approach
AB The amount of wasted polylactic acid (PLA) is increasing because 3D printing services are an increasingly popular offering in many fields. The PLA is widely employed in the fused deposition modeling (FDM) since it is an environmentally friendly polymer. However, failed prototypes or physical models can generate substantial waste. In this study, the feasibility of recycling PLA waste plastic and re-extruded it into new PLA filaments was investigated. An automatic PLA filament extruder was first developed for fabricating new PLA filaments. This paper also discusses the process, challenges, and benefits of recycling PLA waste plastic in an effort to fabricate new PLA filaments more sustainable. It was found that it was possible to fabricate PLA filament using recycled PLA waste plastic. The production cost is only 60% of the commercially available PLA filament. The tensile strength of the developed PLA filament is approximately 1.1 times that of the commercially available PLA filament. The design of experiments approach was employed to investigate the optimal process parameters for fabricating PLA filaments. The most important control factor affecting the diameter of PLA filament is the barrel temperature, followed by recycled material addition ratio, extrusion speed, and cooling distance. The optimal process parameters for fabricating PLA filament with a diameter of 1.7 mm include the barrel temperature of 184 degrees C, extrusion speed of 490 mm/min, cooling distance of 57.5 mm, and recycled material addition ratio of 40%.

AB Skeletal muscle is an electrically and mechanically active tissue that contains highly oriented, densely packed myofibrils. The tissue has self-regeneration capacity upon injury, which is limited in the cases of volumetric muscle loss. Several regenerative therapies have been developed in order to enhance this capacity, as well as to structurally and mechanically support the defect site during regeneration. Among them, biomimetic approaches that recapitulate the native microenvironment of the tissue in terms of parallel-aligned structure and biophysical signals were shown to be effective. In this study, we have developed 3D printed aligned and electrically active scaffolds in which the electrical conductivity was provided by carbonaceous material (CM) derived from algae-based biomass. The synthesis of this conductive and functional CM consisted of eco-friendly synthesis procedure such as pre-carbonization and multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) catalysis. CM obtained from biomass via hydrothermal carbonization (CM-03) and its ash form (CM-03K) were doped within poly(e-caprolactone) (PCL) matrix and 3D printed to form scaffolds with aligned fibers for structural biomimicry. Scaffolds were seeded with C2C12 mouse myoblasts and subjected to electrical stimulation during the in vitro culture. Enhanced myotube formation was observed in electroactive groups compared to their non-conductive counterparts and it was observed that myotube formation and myotube maturity were significantly increased for CM-03 group after electrical stimulation. The results have therefore showed that the CM obtained from macroalgae biomass is a promising novel source for the production of the electrically conductive scaffolds for skeletal muscle tissue engineering.

AB As construction activities become more intensive in developing countries, increasing improperly managed construction and demolition waste (CDW) brings serious environmental impacts. Recycling is a beneficial way to dispose of CDW that reduces environmental impact and brings economic benefits, especially for concrete. China is the country that generates the most CDW in the world, but its domestic recycling rate is much lower than that of developed countries. While the efficient technologies in developed regions have helped them to achieve a well-established recycling industry, whether these innovative technologies can be used to improve the concrete debris recycling targets in developing regions is unclear. This study examines whether innovations currently widely used in construction activities and materials can have a positive effect on the recycling of End-of-Life concrete materials in China. Results from modeling system dynamics imply that the introduction of innovative technologies in the recycling system of concrete debris can probably contribute to CO2 reduction (3.6% reduction) and economic benefits (2.6 times increase, but mainly from landfill charges and fines) from 2022 to 2030. Prefabrication and 3D printing significantly impact recycled concrete production and CDW recycling, and they are recommended as a priority for promotion. In contrast, carbonation is not suggested for application due to its minor role. Nevertheless, since the market share of innovative technologies and the basic CDW recycling rates are currently low in China, fluctuations in their usage are hardly to have a substantial positive impact. We suggest that financial support from the government is needed for upcycling by recyclers and technology providers to improve the base recycling rate in order for innovative technologies to make an effective contribution to the sustainable construction industry, creating a win-win situation for both the economy and the environment of the recycling system.

AB The current study investigates the recyclability of water bottles (PET) and bale wrap (LLDPE) blends reinforced with biocarbon, for developing sustainable biocomposites with more than 95% recycled material. The reinforcing agent (biocarbon) has been made by pyrolyzing the waste coffee ground at an elevated temperature. Enhanced interfacial adhesion and reinforcement leads to improvement in the flexural modulus (similar to 55%) and storage modulus (38%) of the biocomposite with biocarbon obtained by pyrolyzing at 900 degrees C. The presence of lower particle size and relatively higher modulus of biocarbon (900 degrees C) in comparison to biocarbon (500 degrees C) results in resistance in polymer chain movement consequently enhance tensile modulus of biocomposite by 39%. Theoretical calculation of reinforcing efficiency factor (r) and effectiveness coefficient of the reinforcement (C) indicates the homogeneous dispersion of biocarbon in the polymer matrix. Overall, developed biocomposites can be a potential candidate for developing the filaments for 3D printing as well as rigid packaging.

AB In the past two decades, several studies have been reported using agricultural waste as reinforcement in thermoplastic matrices for lightweight and tunable mechanical properties. However, the recycling of thermoplastic with reinforcement of agricultural waste has constraints in the form of the volume of recycled material to support the concept of a circular economy. One of the solutions for bulk consumption of such agricultural and thermoplastic waste is its use in construction applications. In the present study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) was secondary (2 degrees) recycled by reinforcement of stubble waste powder (SWP) through the material extrusion (MEX) process for possible applications in the construction industry. The melt flow index (MFI) investigation suggested the maximum loading of 15% SWP with the recycled HDPE matrix in the present case study. Further, the filament was prepared by using the design of experiment (DoE) with input parameters (heat treatment (pre-heat treatment (PreHT) and post-heat treatment (PostHT), barrel temperature (170-180 degrees C) and screw speed (3-5 RPM) on single screw extruder). The results suggest that the combination of PreHT, 170 degrees C-barrel temperature and 4 RPM screws speed resulted in a maximum Young's modulus (E) of 1386.57 MPa. The PreHT has promoted the recrystallization of the HDPE-SWP blend, which has significantly increased E. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) reveals that the HDPE-SWP composite was more thermally stable after each thermal cycle. In addition, the results of this study were also supported and correlated with the observation of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), surface profiling and 3D printability with MEX.

AB Mechanical recycling is one of the simplest and most economical strategies to address ever-increasing plastic pollution, but it cannot be applied to immiscible mixed plastics and suffers from property deterioration after each cycle. By combining the amphiphilic block copolymer strategy and reactive compatibilization strategy, we designed a series of stapler strategies for compatibilizing/upcycling mixed plastics. First, various functionalized graft copolymers were accessed via different synthetic routes. Subsequently, the addition of a very small amount of stapler molecules induced a synergistic effect with the graft copolymers that improved the compatibility and mechanical properties of mixed plastics. These strategies were highly effective for various binary/ternary plastic systems and can be directly applied to postconsumer waste plastics, which can increase the toughness of mixed postconsumer waste plastics by 162 times. Most importantly, it also effectively improved the impact resistance, adhesion performance, and three-dimensional (3D) printing performance of mixed plastics, and permitted the recycling of plastic blends 20 times with minimal degradation in their mechanical properties.

AB We used high-energy x-ray tomography to characterize Ti-6Al-4V metal powders (both as-received and recycled) used in powder-bed additive manufacturing process. The image processing workflow was developed to process and analyze large amount of data objectively by computer program. The distribution of size and shape of the metal particles as well as defect (mainly porosity) inside the particles was analyzed with the statistical representation and resolution in micrometer. The result revealed that circular-shaped porosity with various sizes could be embedded in the powder particles. These porosities could potentially be transferred to the 3D printed part and critically affect the mechanical performance of the component. The present study shows the effectiveness of characterizing metal powders using x-ray imaging techniques where sufficient number of particles can be sampled within tens of minutes with a minimum sample preparation and high accuracy. Clear structural differences in the as-received and recycled powders were delineated that helps in determining the feasibility of using the recycled powders.

AB Due to concerns of environmental pollution and resource shortage related to the fossil fuel-based nondegradable plastics, biomass/biobased degradable polymer materials, especially polylactide (PLA), have received increasing attention in recent years. Although PLA can be depolymerized back to the cyclic monomer lactide, achieving a closed-loop cycle of "polymer-monomer-polymer", it is very attractive but still a great challenge for recycling PLA to a high-performance polymer through a simple and green strategy suitable for industrialization. Herein, a facile solvent-free one-pot recycling strategy is developed to efficiently convert PLA and end-of-life PLA disposable products into an upgraded PLA-based polymer with enhanced performance. The recycling strategy involves a controlled fast catalytic alcoholysis to prepare a dihydroxyl-terminated PLA oligomer, i.e., PLA-diol, and subsequently a chain extension reaction to obtain PLA-based polyurethane, i.e., PLA-PU. The resulted PLA-diol and PLA-PU with well-defined structures were clearly characterized by H-1 NMR, MALDI-TOF MS, etc. Significantly, the PLA-PU exhibits enhanced mechanical properties that are preferable to those of PLA and can be processed through injection molding, melt spinning, and 3D printing. Besides, PLA-PUs can be directly depolymerized into monomer l-lactide with a high yield under vacuum, revealing its excellent recyclability, which demonstrates a proof of concept for closed-loop recycling from PLA to PLA-PUs and back to PLA. This work opens a potentially new industrial avenue of recycling PLA and other aliphatic polyester plastics.

AB Recycled beef bones (BBs) and crab shells (CSs) were processed into natural derivatives. Through innovative design, these natural derivatives were then combined with biopolymers to create a type of ecofriendly filament suitable for three-dimensional (3D) printing of scaffolds for bone regeneration. The BBs and CSs were thermally processed to produce BB-derived hydroxyapatite (HA) and CS-derived calcium hydroxide (TCS), respectively. Maleic anhydride-modified poly(butylene succinate) (MPBS), HA, and TCS were combined and fabricated into composite filaments, which were then transformed into scaffolds using 3D printing technology. The structure and antibacterial behavior of the obtained composite scaffolds were studied. Alone, PBS showed no bacterial inhibition. A mixture of HA and TCS (THA) was added to MPBS to form a MPBS/THA composite material, which significantly improved the functional properties of cell proliferation and antibacterial effect. The calcium hydroxide content of TCS was responsible for the antibacterial effect. The MPBS/THA composites were porous and displayed enhanced osteoblast proliferation in vitro. The surfaces of the various PBS/HA and MPBS/THA composites showed elevated levels of calcium and phosphorus compounds when exposed to simulated body fluids. Calcium and phosphate ions were rapidly deposited on PBS/HA and MPBS/THA composite scaffolds in osteoblasts according to the cell mineralization assay. Our findings indicate great potential for PBS/HA and MPBS/THA composite scaffolds in bone tissue applications.

AB Arburg Plastic Freeforming (APF) is an advanced and original Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology that melts granulate thermoplastics through a heated reciprocating screw and deposits droplets layer-by layer to build three-dimensional objects. The process requires technological decisions, the environmental repercussions of which are still unexplored.
   This study provides a parametric cradle-to-gate life-cycle assessment of the APF process based on the Ecoinvent dataset and the ReCiPe method. An application is presented to highlight the influence of different materials, process parameters and use scenarios.
   The findings show that printer utilisation is the most significant factor for all environmental impacts. Particularly, the machine production phase accounts for 67% of total impacts on human health, 35% on ecosystem quality and 85% on resource scarcity. The impact of electrical consumption on Global Warming Potential (GWP) makes the 3D printing phase crucial to human health (30%) and ecosystem quality (61%). Since both machine and 3D printing impacts are allocated on the building time, the influence of different materials and process parameters leads to considerable differences in impact indicators. Particularly, the different drop-aspect ratio determines a higher environmental impact of some biopolymers in comparison to oil-derived plastics.
   The sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the recycling of machine components and disposable plate significantly affects human health. Reusing building plates for more than one print job can bring additional benefits to resource scarcity.
   The proposed parametric framework can be effectively applied to assess the environmental impacts of any Arburg Plastic Freeforming production whose total mass and building time are estimated through calculation. These results establish a feasible and effective decisional method to find the most sustainable solution for the 3D printing of functional parts by comparing different sets of parameters.

TI Upcycling Waste Plastics for High -Value Continuous Fibre Reinforced

DT Article
AB Typically, recycled plastics have reduced properties with a larger scatter, compared to their virgin counterparts, often resulting in a lower market value. By using plastic waste streams as a matrix in fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (TPCs), these products can be manufactured more cost-effectively, potentially with properties comparable to virgin TPCs. This research looks at producing continuous fibre reinforced composite tapes made from recyclates (rTapes).
   In a previous study, Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene (PE) and Polyester (PET) waste streams were characterised in terms of rheological properties and contamination effects. The overall mechanical behaviour of the rTape UD-composites and overmolded rTapes was investigated'.
   After the material characterisation, a demonstrator, a typical automotive part, is selected consisting of overmolded rTape inserts. In this demonstrator three types of inserts are combined: pultruded stiffeners, 3D printed frame and weave. The different insert production processes are investigated, and the final demonstrator, containing the rTape inserts overmolded with recycled plastic, manufactured. This resulted in a first-time 100% recycled plastic overmolded TPC demonstrator, with the addition of tailor-made continuous fibre reinforcements on load -bearing locations. As such it shows the potential of plastic recycling in thermoplastic composites manufacturing, with added value and potential lower CO2-footprint and cost reduction.

AB Mouthguards are polymeric devices recommended to be used by athletes to help prevent orofacial injuries. Some of the problems described by the athletes when using the mouthguards can be addressed by producing customized devices with thinner walls by additive processing techniques.
   In the present work, new polymeric materials for this application, such as poly(lactic acid) (rPLA) recycled from food packaging, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), are proposed for the preparation of protective mouthguards, in alternative to the ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer, the current gold standard. Specimens were printed with two different thicknesses (2 mm and 4 mm) to study their influence on the final properties of the printed samples. The characterization included chemical, thermal, surface, and mechanical aspects of commercially acquired polymeric filaments and printed components. All the studied materials showed a decrease in the impact strength with increasing specimen thickness, except for TPU due to its highest deformation capacity. Compared with EVA, TPU has a similar energy absorption, while the other polymers presented higher values.

AB Cities are the core of social interactions and resource consumption in our current times. However, urban systems are still largely based on linear activities in which resources are discarded after usage. Current practices around waste reduce possibilities of circularity, mainly due to low percentages of sorting and recycling practices in high- and middle-income countries and landfill practices in middle- and lowincome countries. This resulted in a continuous increase in urban waste and negative environmental impact over the last decades. The development of circular practices and innovations, such as additive manufacturing, is crucial to modify the current supply chain and return valuable discarded materials to urban industries. Additive manufacturing is a novel technology based on the creation of objects layer by layer involving the use of a diverse range of materials. Several materials such as plastics, metal or concrete, for example, can be transformed into functional products for cities. Based on a literature review, this paper showcases the potential of urban waste for 3D printing with a main focus on recycling practices at the end of the supply chain. This paper aims to examine the current knowledge, regulations, and practices in circularity and additive manufacturing in the urban context, to identify opportunities and practices for material recovery applications, and showcase applications for additive manufacturing at the last stage of the supply chain. Furthermore, it identifies the needs for further research that could support the implementation and diffusion of additive manufacturing in society. (c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Purpose Powder bed additive manufacturing processes are widespread due to their many technical and economic advantages. Nevertheless, the disposal of leftover powder poses a problem in terms of process sustainability. The purpose of this paper is to provide an alternative solution to recycle waste PA12 powder from HP multi jet fusion. In particular, the opportunity to use this material as a dispersion in three-dimensional (3D) printed clay is investigated. Design/methodology/approach A commercial fused deposition modelling printer was re-adapted to extrude a viscous paste composed of clay, PA12 and water. Once printed, parts were dried and then put in an oven to melt the polymer fraction. Four compositions with different PA12 concentration were studied. First, the extrudability of the paste was observed by testing different extrusion lengths. Then, the surface porosities were evaluated through microscopical observations of the manufactured parts. Finally, benchmarks with different geometries were digitalised via 3D scanning to analyse the dimensional alterations arising at each stage of the process. Findings Overall, the feasibility of the process is demonstrated. Extrusion tests revealed that the composition of the paste has a minor influence on the volumetric flow rate, exhibiting a better consistency in the case of long extrusions. The percentage of surface cavities was proportional to the polymer fraction contained in the mix. From dimensional analyses, it was possible to conclude that PA12 reduced the degree of shrinkage during the drying phase, while it increased dimensional alterations occurring in the melting phase. The results showed that the dimensional error measured on the z-axis was always higher than that of the XY plane. Practical implications The method proposed in this paper provides an alternative approach to reuse leftover powders from powder bed fusion processes via another additive manufacturing process. This offers an affordable and open-source solution to companies dealing with polymer powder bed fusion, allowing them to reduce their environmental impacts while expanding their production. Originality/value The paper presents an innovative additive manufacturing solution for powder reuse. Unlike the recycling methods in the body of literature, this solution does not require any intermediate transformation process, such as filament fabrication. Also, the cold material deposition enables the adoption of very inexpensive extrusion equipment. This preliminary study demonstrates the feasibility and the benefits of this process, paving the way for numerous future studies.

AB New technological opportunities and the recent needs of the market, which evolves towards mass customization, create a growing interest on the use of additive technologies (3D printing) to add flexibility on the production geometries and reduce tooling costs. In the sheet-metal bending manufacturing sector, rigid metallic tools are the most commonly used. This article presents recent findings in the field of no spring ban-metal tools for bending. This type of tool ensures long term performance but has limitations on adaptability to specific geometries and implies high production costs. Over the years, unfilled or reinforced plastic materials have often been considered a lightweight and cost-efficient alternative for replacement of metal mechanical parts. The use of polymeric materials can offer cost and time reduction by including new architectures to allow the integration of additive and subtractive production technologies. Furthermore, unfilled thermoplastics can be recycled at the end of the process. The introduction of equipment combining a metallic support base and a polymeric die insert with sufficient strength is proposed as a solution to reach high performances using non-conventional materials. The polymeric die insert may be produced by 3D printing or other rapid manufacturing technologies and it is rapidly changeable. The modular base allows heavy mechanical loads, while the polymeric die reduces the aesthetical defects of the bent sheets. The study shows that, in air bending, polymeric die inserts allow a process capability which is comparable to the capability reached with metal dies. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the geometrical features of the deposited lines, dimensional accuracy of benchmarks and mechanical properties of printed parts are investigated. Design/methodology/approachFirstly, the 3D printer is used to deposit lines of the paste under various combinations of material composition and process parameters. 3D scanning is used to measure their dimensional and geometrical errors. The results are elaborated through statistics to highlight the role of material and processing conditions. Then, four benchmark parts are printed using materials with different percentages of polymer powder. The parts are scanned after each step of the post-processing to quantify the effects of printing, drying and melting on dimensional accuracy. Finally, drop weight tests are carried out to investigate the impact resistance of specimens with different powder contents. FindingsIt is found that the quality of deposition varies with the printing speed, nozzle acceleration and material composition. Also, significant differences are observed at the ends of the lines. Materials with 10 Wt.% and 40 Wt.% of powder exhibit relevant shape variations due to the separation of phases. Accuracy analyses show significant deformations of parts at the green state due to material weight. This effect is more pronounced for higher powder contents. On the other hand, the polymer reduces shrinkage during drying. Furthermore, the impact test results showed that the polymer caused a large increase in impact resistance as compared to pure clay. Nonetheless, a decrease is observed for 40 Wt.% due to the higher amount of porosities. Research limitations/implicationsThe results of this study advance the knowledge on the 3D printing of clay paste reinforced with a scrap polymer powder. This offers a new opportunity to reuse leftover powders from powder bed fusion processes. The findings presented here are expected to foster the adoption of this technique reducing the amount of waste powder disposed of by additive manufacturing companies. Originality/valueThis study offers some important insights into the relations between process conditions and the geometry of the deposited lines. This is of practical relevance to toolpath planning. The dimensional analyses allow for understanding the role of each post-processing step on the dimensional error. Also, the comparison with previous findings highlights the role of part dimensions. The present research explores, for the first time, the impact resistance of parts produced by this technology. The observed enhancement of this property with respect to pure clay may open new opportunities for the application of this manufacturing process.

ID IMPACTS
AB The inadequate disposal of obsolete electronic materials over the years has brought negative consequences to the environment. The EDUCABOT3D project seeks, in this sense, to disseminate the necessary knowledge about environmental awareness, through actions of reuse of electronic waste components, and the proper disposal of non-reusable items. By means of a booklet, called the Correct Disposal Booklet for e-waste, the risks brought to nature are exposed when e-waste is incorrectly disposed, as well as exposing ways to reuse e-waste, where to discard non-reusable items, among other relevant information. A mobile robot chassis has been modeled for 3D printing, using two ways of control between sensors and actuators, one with a rapid prototyping board and another assembled with reused components in a printed circuit board. The reuse of e-waste, applied to robotics, is a matter of great community interest, as it may encourage young people to reuse their obsolete devices and deliver them to appropriate places for recycling. As result, the concepts of computing and environmental education are disseminated by means of presentations, teaching classes and booklet distribution in high schools.

AB Materials derived from natural sources are demanded for future applications due to the combination of factors such as sustainability increase and legislature requirements. The availability and efficient analysis of vegetable oils (triacylglycerides) open an enormous potential for incorporating these compounds into various products to ensure the ecological footprint decreases and to provide advantageous properties to the eventual products, such as flexibility, toughness, or exceptional hydrophobic character. The double bonds located in many vegetable oils are centers for chemical functionalization, such as epoxidization, hydroxylation, or many nucleophile substitutions using acids or anhydrides. Naturally occurring castor oil comprises a reactive vacant hydroxyl group, which can be modified via numerous chemical approaches. This comprehensive Review provides an overall insight toward multiple materials utilities for functionalized glycerides such as additive manufacturing (3D printing), polyurethane materials (including their chemical recycling), coatings, and adhesives. This work provides a complex list of investigated and studied applications throughout the available literature and describes the chemical principles for each selected application.

AB Excessive building demolition waste (BDW) has become a major factor affecting the ecological environment. In recent years, scholars have explored BDW disposal from various perspectives, including policy, theory, and technology. However, the current recycling and reusing rate of BDW remains low. Thus, this paper explores a novel market-oriented circulation channel for BDW and proposes a BDW trading conceptual framework based on digital twin (DT). Two key technologies and four key services involved are discussed. To verify the effectiveness of the framework, a real-life case study is conducted by integrating IoT, big data, robotics, and 3D printing technologies. With the DT-based BDW trading system, BDW disposal processes could be accurately mapped. Contractors and recyclers could conduct online product browsing, communication, and transactions. The digital bi-directional information interaction shows great potential for improving the recycling and reusing rate of BDW.

AB Current reports of healthcare sensors within literature that use additive manufacturing electrochemistry all utilise conductive PLA, which is unsuitable for widespread use within the industry. Poly(ethylene terephthalate glycol (PETg) is a polymeric material with proven attributes for additive manufacturing due to its thermal and mechanical properties. Likewise, its excellent chemical stability transforms PETg into a desirable alternative for developing healthcare sensing devices. In this work, we report the production, physicochemical and electrochemical characterisations, as well as the electroanalytical performance of an enhanced electrically conductive additive manufacturing filament made with recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate glycol (rPETg) and a combination of carbon black, multi-walled carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoplatelets as conductive fillers. The post-print activation of additive manufactured electrodes from this material is optimised and shown to produce enhanced electrochemical performance compared to non-activated electrodes, with a k0 of 1.03x10- 3 cm s- 1. The sterilisation for the real application of sensors in the biomedical field is a critical point, the electrodes were submitted to standard UV light treatment showing to be reliable compared to PLA in the determination of uric acid (30-500 mu M) and sodium nitrite (0.1-5 mM) within synthetic urine using differential pulse voltammetry and chronoamperometry techniques. A sensitivity and LOD for uric acid of 25.7 mu A mu M-1 and 0.27 mu M, and 52.6 mu A mM-1 and 2.69 mu M for nitrite were obtained within synthetic urine, respectively. The re-useability of the electrodes was also tested for the detection of uric acid, showing that the electrode could be used up to 10 times before a significant decrease in the results was observed. We demonstrate that a new conductive rPETg with superior electrochemical performance has a prominent place within the development of additive manufacturedprinted healthcare sensors due to its ability to be sterilised and re-used, low solution ingress, and its potential to tackle rising costs and plastic waste problems within the healthcare sector.

AB Polymers have a reputation for several advantageous characteristics like chemical resistance, weight reduction, and simple form-giving processes. The rise of additive manufacturing technologies such as Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) has introduced an even more versatile production process that supported new product design and material concepts. This led to new investigations and innovations driven by the individualization of customized products. The other side of the coin contains an increasing resource and energy consumption satisfying the growing demand for polymer products. This turns into a magnitude of waste accumulation and increased resource consumption. Therefore, appropriate product and material design, taking into account end-of-life scenarios, is essential to limit or even close the loop of economically driven product systems. In this paper, a comparison of virgin and recycled biodegradable (polylactic acid (PLA)) and petroleum-based (polypropylene (PP) & support) filaments for extrusion-based Additive Manufacturing is presented. For the first time, the thermo-mechanical recycling setup contained a service-life simulation, shredding, and extrusion. Specimens and complex geometries with support materials were manufactured with both, virgin and recycled materials. An empirical assessment was executed through mechanical (ISO 527), rheological (ISO 1133), morphological, and dimensional testing. Furthermore, the surface properties of the PLA and PP printed parts were analyzed. In summary, PP parts and parts from its support structure showed, in consideration of all parameters, suitable recyclability with a marginal parameter variance in comparison to the virgin material. The PLA components showed an acceptable decline in the mechanical values but through thermo-mechanical degradation processes, rheological and dimensional properties of the filament dropped decently. This results in significantly identifiable artifacts of the product optics, based on an increase in surface roughness.

AB Imine-based vitrimers were prepared from synthesized diimine-dimethacrylate monomer derived from biobased vanillin. First, a methacrylate derivative starting from vanillin was synthesized. The diimine derivative was synthesized by condensation of the aldehyde groups from two vanillin methacrylate units with the amine groups of hexamethylenediamine (HMDA). The synthesized product was used in formulations containing ethylene glycol phenyl ether methacrylate (EGPMA) as a reactive diluent for the customization of final material properties and cured by exposure to ultraviolet (UV)-light using suitable radical photoinitiators or else with temperature using a radical thermal initiator. Materials with glass transition temperatures (T(g)s) ranging from 70 to 90 degrees C were prepared, showing good thermal stability and mechanical and thermomechanical properties. The evaluation of their vitrimeric characteristics revealed that all materials achieved a stress-relaxation factor (sigma = 0.37 sigma(0)) in less than 130 s at 160 degrees C, with photocured materials exhibiting faster relaxation rates. The catalytic effect of phosphine oxide groups in imine metathesis has also been evidenced. All prepared materials could be mechanically recycled and completely solubilized in a two-step degradation process, putting evidence of their potential use for carbon fiber-reinforced composites (CFRCs). In addition, they demonstrated promising self-repairing abilities. Finally, as a proof of concept, it was established that these formulations could be effectively processed using a Digital Light Processing three-dimensional (3D) Printer (DLP), resulting in the fabrication of complex shapes with high resolution.

AB Most plastics originate from limited petroleum reserves and cannot be effectively recycled at the end of their life cycle, making them a significant threat to the environment and human health. Closed-loop chemical recycling, by depolymerizing plastics into monomers that can be repolymerized, offers a promising solution for recycling otherwise wasted plastics. However, most current chemically recyclable polymers may only be prepared at the gram scale, and their depolymerization typically requires harsh conditions and high energy consumption. Herein, it reports less petroleum-dependent closed-loop recyclable silica-based nanocomposites that can be prepared on a large scale and have a fully reversible polymerization/depolymerization capability at room temperature, based on catalysis of free aminopropyl groups with the assistance of diethylamine or ethylenediamine. The nanocomposites show glass-like hardness yet plastic-like light weight and toughness, exhibiting the highest specific mechanical strength superior even to common materials such as poly(methyl methacrylate), glass, and ZrO2 ceramic, as well as demonstrating multifunctionality such as anti-fouling, low thermal conductivity, and flame retardancy. Meanwhile, these nanocomposites can be easily processed by various plastic-like scalable manufacturing methods, such as compression molding and 3D printing. These nanocomposites are expected to provide an alternative to petroleum-based plastics and contribute to a closed-loop materials economy.

AB This work investigates the impact of resin reuse on the form accuracy and hydrodynamic stability of microfluidic channels fabricated via Projection Micro-Stereolithography (P mu SL). Three micro-optofluidic (MoF) devices were manufactured using fresh, once and twice reused photocurable resin batches. Resin reuse offers a sustainable approach that addresses recycling challenges associated with cured acrylate and methacrylate resins, making it an increasingly effective option for eco-friendly manufacturing. The devices were tested through an air-water bi-phase flow to assess hydrodynamic stability. A Phase I distribution-free quality control approach employing recursive sequential and permutation (RS/P) methods was conducted to evaluate channels' width stability, while Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) was exploited to track chemical changes in reused resin batches. A Design of Experiment (DoE) study allowed hydrodynamic performance to be analyzed for the devices, revealing that increasing the flow rate to 0.3 mL/min enhanced stability across all devices, overcoming flow constriction effects caused by the photocurable resin reuse.

ID ENERGY-STORAGE; DENSITY
AB In order to realize sustainable renewable energy supply, large-scale energy storage system is needed to overcome the problem of intermittency of power generation. Vanadium redox flow battery (VRFB) presents the most viable solution but faces the problem of high material cost. In this study, we have established a cost-effective process to prepare vanadium electrolyte for VRFB from an untouched industrial waste, ammonia slag, by pH control under atmospheric condition (<95 degrees C). The extracted solution changed color during electrolytic reduction as yellow, blue, dark green and purple, matched with the colors of V5+, V4+, V3+, and V2+, respectively, indicating accurate change of the valences without forming precipitates. Electrolyte prepared from the recycled vanadium showed almost the same charging/discharging performances as the one prepared from commercial V2O5 reagent battery tests during the first several cycles, but degraded rapidly after 16 cycles, caused by impurities that deactivate the negative electrode for the reduction of V3+ to V2+. The miniature VRFB prototype built by employing 3D printing technique showed a much higher performance than the H-cell, indicating the flow cell configuration could help to push up the diffusion limit of vanadium redox by flowing the electrolyte solution through the electrodes, as well as reducing IR loss and water splitting to increase the efficiency.

AB The application of non-destructive techniques for the evaluation of internal damage in composite materials is a challenge due to their complexity. The aim of this study is to analyse the ability of ultrasonic technique to identify and evaluate manufacturing defects and internal damage in composite laminates. Artificial object inclusions of different shapes, sizes and materials were embedded in carbon fibre reinforced epoxy (CFRP) laminates. Comprehensive investigation of non-destructive evaluation using phased array ultrasonic testing to trace and characterize the embedded defects is presented. Phased array ultrasonic technique was able to precisely locate most of the artificial inclusion in the composite laminates. Nerveless, the shape and size of the inclusions were not accurately determined due to the high signal attenuation and distortion characteristics of the carbon fibre epoxy composite.
   Furthermore, a major concern affecting the efficient use of composite laminates is their vulnerability to low velocity impact damage. The dynamic behaviour of composite laminates is very complex as there are many concurrent phenomena during composite laminate failure under impact loading. Thus, the practicality of the previous results is demonstrated by the evaluation of impacted carbon fibre reinforced epoxy laminates using ultrasonic testing. The influence of laminate thickness and impact energy on impact damage is also investigated. The performance of phased array ultrasonic testing for the inspection of composite laminates with barely visible impact damage is evaluated. In addition, fibre-reinforced thermoplastic composites are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their excellent mechanical performance and potential recycling. In this study, impact damage in 3D printed continuous glass fibre reinforced thermoplastic laminates is also analysed. Phased array ultrasonic testing is performed and the amount of damage is quantified in terms of delaminated area.

AB The article presents the results of research on the synthesis of a new eco-polyol based on polylactide (PLA) waste and its use for the production of rigid polyurethane-polyisocyanurate (RPU/PIR) foams. The obtained recycling-based polyol was subjected to analytical, physicochemical and spectroscopic tests (FTIR, H-1 NMR, C-13 NMR) to confirm its suitability for the synthesis of polyurethane materials. Then, it was used to partially replace petrochemical polyol in polyurethane formulation. The obtained RPU/PIR foams were characterized by lower apparent density, brittleness, and water absorption. In addition, foams modified by eco-polyol had higher flame retardancy, as compared to reference foam. The results of the research show that the use of PLA polyol based on plastic waste may be an alternative to petrochemical polyols. This research matches with the current trends of sustainable development and green chemistry.

AB The presented study was conducted in order to evaluate the correlation between the structural properties of recycled PET-based blends for materials using the three-dimensional (3D) printing technique. The recycled rPET resin was melt-blended with amorphous polyesters, poly(ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG), and poly(cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) glycol (PCTG). The obtained blends were intended for the material extrusion printing method (MEX), while some of the samples were prepared by an injection molding technique. The study aimed to examine the impact of waste materials on the quality of products obtained in the MEX process. The tested materials were rPET/PETG and rPET/PCTG blends, and an elastomeric impact modifier was used to improve the toughness of the prepared composition. During the study, the reactive extrusion method was used for blend compatibilization. The samples were tested to determine their mechanical and thermal properties. A static tensile test, a Charpy impact test, and a hardness test were performed. Thermal analysis was performed by using HDT, DMTA, and DSC tests. The research showed that even a large share of the rPET material had a positive effect on the obtained mechanical and thermal performance of the tested samples. In addition, the annealed samples had higher values of HDT temperature as well as hardness and E modulus. The annealing procedure revealed that for heat-treated samples, the heat resistance was improved; however, in some cases, the warpage was present.

AB Properties of polymers and composites deteriorate due to hydrothermal aging and recycling. To enable rapid structural degradation assessment after a certain time in service, a novel rapid method of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) of degradation degree was developed. It is shown that it is possible by using quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling principles and rapid Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic characterization to evaluate rapidly the degradation degree of polymers due to both aging and recycling. The methodology was validated in a case study, using polylactic acid (PLA) material, hygrothermally aged for 60 days at 40 degrees C, immersed in distilled water. Mechanical recycling cycles, involving grinding, extrusion, and additive manufacturing (AM; 3D printing), were performed at intervals of 15 days of hygrothermal aging. The developed QSPR methodology accurately predicted Young's modulus values of PLA material, both in a virgin and aged state, capturing stiffness degradation due to hygrothermal aging and recycling after 15, 30, 45, and 60 days, until complete deterioration of the polymer was achieved, at 60 days of aging and four cycles of aging & recycling. This novel NDE methodology contributes to the advancement of the modular multiscale modeling framework.

AB Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites are widely used for their corrosion resistance, high strength, stiffness, and lightweight properties. However, the extensive use of carbon fiber generates significant waste at the end of its lifecycle. Recycling technologies can effectively recover carbon fiber from this waste, making it suitable for reuse in various applications. Recently, there has been a growing trend in using recycled carbon fiber as a reinforcement material in polymer matrices, offering a cost-effective alternative to virgin carbon fiber while maintaining excellent mechanical properties. However, most studies focus on the mechanical strength of parts made from recycled and virgin carbon fibers, with less attention given to the environmental impacts of these materials. The primary objective of this study is the comparative analysis of the specimens manufactured using recycled and virgin carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide-12 material based on the mechanical performance, life cycle cost, and environmental impact. The experimental investigations showed that the mechanical performance of the recycled carbon fiber reinforced polyamide-12 (rCFRP12) composites is more efficient than the specimens manufactured using the virgin carbon fiber reinforced polyamide-12 (vCFRP12) composites such as three-point bending test results show that parts made from rCFRP12 composites achieved a flexural strength of 56.25 MPa, outperforming those made with vCFRP12 (49.9 MPa). Additionally, the recycled composite specimens also exhibited higher tensile strength than their virgin carbon fiber counterparts. The life cycle analysis revealed that samples made with recycled carbon fiber have a lower environmental impact, reducing global warming, ozone depletion, and carcinogenic effects by 11.98 % compared to those made with virgin carbon fiber. Additionally, the production cost of recycled carbon fiber is significantly lower than virgin carbon fiber.

AB The fused deposition modeling (FDM) process, an extrusion-based 3D printing technology, enables the manufacture of complex geometrical elements. This technology employs diverse materials, including thermoplastic polymers and composites as well as recycled resins to encourage sustainable growth. FDM is used in a variety of industrial fields, including automotive, biomedical, and textiles, as a rapid prototyping method to reduce costs and shorten production time, or to develop items with detailed designs and high precision. The main phases of this technology include the feeding of solid filament into a molten chamber, capillary flow of a non-Newtonian fluid through a nozzle, layer deposition on the support base, and layer-to-layer adhesion. The viscoelastic properties of processed materials are essential in each of the FDM steps: (i) predicting the printability of the melted material during FDM extrusion and ensuring a continuous flow across the nozzle; (ii) controlling the deposition process of the molten filament on the print bed and avoiding fast material leakage and loss of precision in the molded part; and (iii) ensuring layer adhesion in the subsequent consolidation phase. Regarding this framework, this work aimed to collect knowledge on FDM extrusion and on different types of rheological properties in order to forecast the performance of thermoplastics.

AB The recycling of polystyrene (PS)-based cups for the additive manufacturing of sustainable, cost-effective, and high-performance electrochemical devices is presented here for the first time. In this approach, we integrated graphite (Gpt, a conductive material) within the PS matrix (a thermoplastic component) to design alternative conductive filaments for the production of new electrochemical sensors using a 3D pen (an easy-to-use and transportable tool). Various material ratios were examined, with the Gpt/PS (50:50) composition showing enhanced electrochemical performance without compromising printability. Structural, morphological, and thermal information on the proposed materials was accessed using Raman and infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis. The electrochemical features of the material were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and voltammetric measurements using model species such as [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-), hexaminruthenium (III) chloride, and dopamine, highlighting a charge transfer resistance (Rct) value of 1.5 k Omega and an elevated electroactive area of 49.3 mm(2) due to the electrical properties offered by Gpt. Additionally, a differential pulse voltammetry based method was developed for sulfanilamide antibiotic detection, a molecule of interest in various fields (pharmaceutical, food, and environmental). Noteworthy linear ranges (1-10 mu mol L--(1) and 10-50 mu mol L-1), a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.3 mu mol L-1, high intra- and inter-electrode precisions (RSD < 2.2 %), and selectivity even in the presence of other antibiotics were observed. When applied to real samples, such as pharmaceuticals, water, and milk, recoveries close to 100 % demonstrated the accuracy and reliability of the electrochemical analyses. These results validate the performance of the proposed 3D-printed sensor and underscore a sustainable electrochemical investigation in alignment with circular economy precepts.

AB While the influence of particle size and geometry on the dynamics of binary fluidised beds have been widely studied, the role of particle shape remains poorly understood. Using 3D-printed PLA particles with geometries chosen to allow significant alterations in geometry while maintaining a constant volume and density, we are able to isolate and hence systematically study the influence of particles' shape on their spatial distribution throughout the system. Using Positron Emission Particle Tracking, we track the motion of particles throughout the full, three-dimensional volume of the system, thereby characterising the distribution of PLA particles within the bed. Despite varying the aspect ratio of particles by more than two orders of magnitude, only minimal changes in particle distribution are observed. Our results also give potentially valuable new insight into the internal behaviours of sand-plastic systems representative of those used in the pyrolytic recycling of plastic waste.

AB Problems of long extraction time, large footprint, low single-stage extraction efficiency, and complicated production processes in solvent extraction equipment in recycling of modern industrial precious metal waste liquids are addressed and application of miniaturized equipment to hydrometallurgy is proposed in this study. A 3D-printed multichannel microfluidic reactor will likely replace traditional extraction equipment. The reactor was applied to experiments concerning tributyl phosphate extraction and separation of platinum, palladium and rhodium precious metal ions in a hydrochloric acid system. Results showed that, under the conditions of a ratio of 1:1 and a flow rate of 192.5 mL min-1 (processing capacity of 1.5L h-1), the extraction rates of platinum and palladium are 84.26% and 96%, and the separation coefficient is beta(Pt/Rh) and beta(Pd /Rh) is 132.35 and 753.5,moreover, the optimized extraction rate of platinum and palladium in the reactor increases by 2% and 1%, respectively. Hence, the extraction effect of this reactor is better than conventional industrial single-stage extraction (extraction time 12min, platinum extraction rate 87.43%, palladium extraction rate 90.86%, separation coefficients beta(Pd/Rh) and beta(Pt/Rh) are only 65.3 and 45.7). In summary, compared with conventional extraction, microreactor extraction can increase the separation coefficient, shorten the extraction time, and the total processing capacity can reach the industrial production level. In addition, this study also discussed the influence of microreactor structure optimization on the extraction effect. (c) 2020 Society of Chemical Industry

AB Gas hold-up reduction inside hydroprocessors is critical to improving the efficiency of bitumen conversion. The use of internal gas/liquid segregation devices, such as recycle cups, has been the focus of much past research and development over the previous five decades. In this study, the effects of different recycle cup designs and working fluids were evaluated using a pilot-scale cold-flow ebullated bed reactor and compared to multiphase flow simulation predictions. Two recycle cup designs from the literature were fabricated using 3D printing technology and two working fluids were used: air-water and air-5 wt% ethanol aqueous solutions. The addition of ethanol helped create high gas hold-up and foaming conditions frequently observed in commercial hydroprocessors. It was observed that in foaming systems, the performance of the recycle cups deteriorated. Additionally, increasing the liquid flow rate, either through the inlet or increased recycle, resulted in diminished gas/liquid segregation efficiency. The accuracy of simulations using the two -fluid model was evaluated to predict gas hold-up in the pilot scale system as well as inside the recycle line. In the homogeneous flow regime, given the proper bubble size, the si-mulations predicted the gas hold-up in the column with less than 5% error. However, unlike the experimental observations, simulations did not predict any gas entrained in the recycle line, which is attributed to variation in the average bubble size and limitations of the existing momentum exchange closures.& COPY; 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

TI Strengthening Polyethylene Thermoplastics through a Dynamic Covalent
   Networking Additive Based on Alkylboron Chemistry
SO MACROMOLECULES
LA English
DT Article
AB Polyethylene (PE) is the most heavily used polymer worldwide. Considerable efforts have focused on modifying properties of PE via cross-linking. In contrast to previous cross-linking methods, which generate PE thermosets of low process-ability, here, we report the development of a dynamic covalent networking additive (DCNA) that possesses the PE backbone and reconfigurable network with alkyl boronic esters as novel dynamic linkages. The addition of DCNA at 5 wt % provides PE materials with clearly improved mechanical (e.g., tensile strength, Young's modulus, and yield strength) and rheological (e.g., creep resistance) properties at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the obtained materials could be easily reprocessed, recycled, and 3D-printed, creating opportunities toward sustainable and high-performance PE materials.

TI Designing 3D-Printed Mesh-Covered Fluid Collecting Racks (MFCRs) to
   Prevent Moisture-Related COVID-19 Sampling Interruptions in Taiwan

ID CORONAVIRUS
AB Background: A sampling platform (or table) set at the patient's side in a zero-exposure screening center (booth) might be used for specimen collection during public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic. However, repeated sanitization causes moisture problems. Such moisture problems would not only be noted by patients but also interrupt the sampling process. In this study, we aimed to develop 3D-printed mesh-covered fluid collecting racks (MFCRs) to address surface moisture problems to determine whether MFCRs can shorten the sampling time. Methods: This was an observational, descriptive, and cross-sectional study. We observed the reasons for sampling interruptions related to surface moisture problems among patients who used MFCRs or did not (April 28-30, 2022). We used a 3D printer to make an MFCR, which measured 14.5 cm in width and length and 1.0 cm in height. The MFCR allows the ethanol to drain through the mesh into the fluid collection rack below to leave a relatively dry surface on the mesh. Finally, we calculated the median time to finish sampling between MFCRs and non-MFCRs. Results: A total of 400 patients were randomly observed (using MFCRs, n = 200; non-MFCRs, n = 200). Patients in the non-MFCR group were more likely to interrupt the sampling process (n = 39, 19.5%) by noting surface moisture problems than those in the MFCR group (n = 3, 1.5%). Two of the major interruptions, "asking questions about the moist surface" (from 12% to 1%) and "slowing down their actions" (from 4.5% to 0.5%), were obviously improved by using MFCRs. Overall, the median sampling time was significantly shorter (p < 0.001) in the group using MFCRs (0.6 min) than in the group using non-MFCRs (1.5 min). The MFCRs shortened the sampling time by 60%, which might be associated with decreasing interruptions caused by surface moisture problems. Conclusions: The 3D printed MFCRs are suitable for handling surface moisture problems caused by repeated sanitizations. More importantly, the MFCRs might be associated with decreasing interruptions caused by moisture problems.

AB Additive manufacturing potentially generates customized polymeric objects with tailored geometry while reducing waste, employing biodegradable polymers and striving to use recyclable polymer feedstocks for a more sustainable future. Binder jetting additive manufacturing (BJ AM) creates 3D objects upon depositing liquid adhesive onto a powder bed, while a roller spreads powder over a build stage to form subsequent layers. Many factors affect jettability and printability including printhead design, binder material, binder solvent and powder characteristics. Material design for higher strength BJ AM parts using metals, ceramics or polymers exploits binders or particles that transform into thermosets or permanently shaped matrices through thermal or UV curing and sintering. While many BJ AM examples utilize biodegradable, water-soluble and recyclable polymers for biomedical and industrial applications, a wider array of opportunities exist to degrade, dissolve and reuse printed materials. Systematically shifting to these polymers will facilitate reuse and recycling of both binders and powders, but more studies to improve part strength are required. This review describes an overview of polymer jettability and a perspective into opportunities currently underutilized in transitioning BJ AM into a more sustainable AM platform.

ID HYDROGELS
AB Sustainable underwater adhesives have attracted wide attention in fields such as marine exploration and biomedicine. The development of recyclable underwater adhesives that can achieve strong and durable adhesion to various substrates is a daunting challenge. Herein, a series of recyclable underwater adhesives are developed through synergistic engineering of molecular design and multiple dynamic cross-linking networks. The selected well-designed adhesives exhibit excellent underwater adhesion on a variety of substrates, achieving a maximum adhesion strength up to 3.31 MPa. By integrating dynamic covalent and non-covalent cross-links, the adhesive demonstrates rapid self-healing, on-demand reversible adhesion/desorption, and consistent adhesion performance over more than 30 reuse cycles. Moreover, dynamic disulfide bonds impart dual closed-loop recyclability to the adhesive: chemical recycling achieves up to 89.6% monomer recovery, while physical recycling through melt reprocessing allows for effective reuse of adhesive waste. Furthermore, these adhesives exhibit 3D printability, thereby underscoring their great potential for creating customizable underwater adhesives. This study offers new insights into the development of recyclable underwater adhesives that combine strong, repeatable adhesion and desorption with 3D printing capabilities, paving the way for their broader adoption in practical applications.

AB This study presents the results of optimizing FDM 3D printing parameters (layer height deposited in one pass-Lh and filling density-Id) to enhance the mechanical performance of three-point bending specimens made from PETG and recycled PETG (rPETG). The objectives of the study are to investigate the influence of variable parameters (Lh and Id) on the three-point bending behavior of additively manufactured specimens by thermoplastic extrusion of PETG and rPETG. It is also aims to optimize the manufacturing parameters to maximize mechanical performance, but also to evaluate the potential of using rPETG in mechanical engineering applications. The materials analyzed in this study are PETG and recycled PETG (rPETG), in the context of promoting the concept of circular economy. Using the QIDI Q1 Pro 3D printer, and the variable parameters of FDM, Lh = (0.10; 0.15; 0.20) mm and Id = (50; 75; 100)%, 90 three-point bending specimens (45 from PETG and 45 from rPETG) were additively manufactured. To determine the mechanical strength characteristics under three-point bending stress, all 90 additively manufactured specimens were tested in three-point bending using a Barrus White 20 kN universal testing machine. The maximum bending stress is influenced by the two considered variable parameters of FDM (Lh and Id), the parameter with the greater impact being Id. Comparing the results of the maximum bending stresses of the additively manufactured specimens made of PETG and rPETG using the optimal parameters, it was found that the maximum bending stresses are higher in the case of the rPETG specimens, which highlights the potential of using recycled plastics in mechanical engineering applications.

AB Antimicrobial materials are required to diminish the propagation of infectious diseases. Exploiting photosensitization of cytotoxic singlet oxygen (O-1(2)), we report a strategy for manufacturing an antimicrobial filament by combining a halogenated boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY) photosensitizer (PS) with polylactic acid (PLA). The filament (PLA(PS)) was then used to three-dimensional (3D)-print square-shaped objects and meshes, facilitating material characterization and testing. The results demonstrate that the spectroscopic characteristics of the PS entrapped in the polymeric matrix are preserved, including its photostability. These properties were maintained after two cycles of recycling, proving the reusability of PLA(PS). Irradiation of the material with green light triggers O-1(2), as evidenced by oxidation of a water-soluble anthracene derivative and direct detection of O-1(2) luminescence experiments. Fluorescence microscopy studies, assessing real-time bacterial inactivation on the material's surface, indicate complete elimination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the imaging region after 40 min of irradiation with a low light dose (1.6 J/cm(2)). Furthermore, a prototype of a water treatment apparatus was assembled and successfully inactivated 99.9% of Shigella dysenteriae, a typical waterborne pathogen. This sets the stage and opens diverse avenues for a cost-effective and straightforward design of sustainable 3D materials for light-mediated microbial deactivation.

In this work, the researchers utilized secondary (2o) recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as the base matrix and wastes such as wood dust (WD), Fe powder, and bakelite powder (BP) as reinforcements for preparing the multi-layered (layers of different composite material) tensile and flexural composite specimen through FFF technique of additive manufacturing. The reinforced composite feedstock filaments prepared in-house by the twin screw extrusion process were utilized to print multi-layered specimens by varying the infill speed, infill density, and raster angle during the FFF process. The outer three layers on both sides of the multi-layered specimen were printed with filament reinforced with BP and Fe powder whereas the inner layers were composed of WD-reinforced filaments to induce specific characteristics. The influence of printing parameters on the selected mechanical properties of composite specimens was investigated and analyzed through electron-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning electron microscopic (SEM) characterization. The optimization results highlighted that 0o raster angle, 100% infill density, and 20 mm/s infill speed yield the best values of the tensile strength (15.35 MPa), flexural strength (32.11 MPa), percentage tensile break elongation (7.16%) and percentage flexural break elongation (12.39%) with the desirability of 0.719 when all the output parameters were taken simultaneously. The main motivation behind the work is to print multi-material smart tiles for low-temperature regions to conserve the heat inside the cabins along with self-assembly features.

AB Water scarcity is going to become one of the most serious challenges globally. Nearly 98% of the world?s available water is sea or brackish water and desalination is an alternative source of clean water to recycling. Solar driven water desalination solutions could provide a viable low cost and large scale alternative with minimal environmental impacts. In this paper, experimental work carried out to improve the evaporation efficiency of potable water from the salty water by developing the micro and nano hierarchical structures with the help of 3D printing technology and anodization. The prepared micro and nano hierarchical structures tested along with Aluminum sheet and anodized Aluminum sheet with and without impregnating. These three types of materials tested with three different water quantities, like 50 ml, 100 ml, and 200 ml on sunny days. The maximum efficiency for all three materials observed for 50 ml of water. Among all three elements, micro and nano hierarchical structures with 50 ml got the highest efficiency of 60%.

AB The serious impact of plastic waste on environmental pollution and climate change led to new strategies like recycle, reuse, reduce concept. This work presents a unique sustainable approach of developing filament composites with improved thermal and mechanical properties by mixing the plastic waste (i.e. waste Walmart bag, High Density Polyethylene (HDPE)) and surface engineered spent coffee ground (SCG) waste derived carbon. Carbon as filler materials were obtained by pyrolyzing the SCG waste. As the biomass derived carbon generally has inert surface properties, it causes poor compatibility between the filler and polymer matrix yielding inferior thermal and mechanical properties of the composites. So, the properties of pyrolyzed carbon in the present work were tailored by SF6 plasma treatment at different time durations. The surface functionalization of carbon materials and optimized plasma treatment time were analyzed from different characterizations. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) reveals 15 min plasma treatment carbon is the optimized one with highest fluorination and semi-ionic C-F bonding. Due to the highest fluorination, the ID/IG ratio i.e. the defect density is found to be maximum for 15 min plasma treated carbon from the Raman spectra. The 15 min plasma treated carbon with highest fluorine functionalization as a filler exhibits 33.8 % and 13.97 % improvement in tensile modulus and tensile strength in comparison to neat HDPE matrix. The feasibility test of filament composites for 3D printing suggests its application potentiality in Material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing.

AB Green, or biodegradable, composite materials are gaining attraction because they are less harmful to the environment and have the potential to eventually replace traditional composite materials. PLA-based green composites have drawn more and more attention from researchers due to the growing ecological risk and environmental consciousness. Because of its excellent mechanical and thermal qualities, eco-friendliness, biodegradability, and antibacterial qualities, PLA has emerged as the most promising matrix material for sustainable bio composites. These composites have the potential to be more appealing than conventional petroleum-based composites, which are toxic and nonbiodegradable. Due to their cost-effectiveness and lightweight nature, composite materials are widely used in a wide range of applications in the structural, automotive, aerospace, and other household sectors. However, the recycling process of traditional fiber-reinforced plastics frequently poses environmental challenges. The mechanical characteristics of bio composites may be greatly affected by the kind of fiber employed in the fiber/matrix adhesion. Furthermore, the current state of PLA 3D printing with natural fiber reinforcement was outlined, along with its potential in 4D printing for uses of stimuli-responsive polymers. The purpose of this study is to highlight the progress made and investigations completed on bio-composites based on natural fibers and polylactic acid (PLA) during the last decade. The synthesis, biodegradation, properties, methods and possible uses of PLA-derived bio composite materials are all summarized in this article.

AB Rising material costs, growing pollution, and the consequences of climate change have made circular economy popular. Its core principle is to use the value embedded in resources more than once for economic and ecological reasons. Learning factories can be used to promote this concept in engineering education. A particularly interesting application involves use cases where waste can be utilized immediately within the learning facility. This paper compares the currently used 3D printing with a simple transfer molding process that enables the direct recycling of rejects. For this purpose, several measured and calculated metrics, such as resource consumption and (environmental) costs, were considered to evaluate the performance of the two manufacturing technologies. For the present use case in a specific learning factory, transfer molding proved to be the preferred technology.

AB Metals, and in particular rare earth elements are important building blocks in the progress of our society toward a cleaner and safer environment, mainly in the development of new systems for microelectronics and renewable energy. The paper is an attempt to briefly present some innovative ideas on the efficient use of these materials in the context of their criticality. Two examples are discussed. The first is related the use of mixed rare earth oxides as dopants for the fabrication of mean temperature solid electrolytes for SOFCs with improved ionic conductivity. A second example is to use microwave energy to recycle WEEE and obtain materials ready to be used for additive manufacturing (3D printing) of permanent magnets based on NdFeB system.

AB Laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) is currently being applied to manufacture engineering-crucial components. To maintain consistent part quality, accuracy and speed in the quality assurance of atomized metal feedstock powder is critical. 3D x-ray tomography (XRT), coupled with machine learning algorithms, provides a transformative route to powder characterization and classification. A recycled AA7050 feedstock powder was studied through XRT to demonstrate a scheme for classification of highly deformed particles which vary both in geometric morphology and degree of surface irregularity. Manual, unsupervised, and supervised classification algorithms were optimized to reproduce visual classification, demonstrating how different approaches to algorithm training may provide a balance between the amount of training data and acceptable final accuracy. The reported approach provides a robust methodology that links 3D measurements and powder classification as means to control powder-induced defects and improve mechanical performance in printed parts.

AB This study examines variations in the material properties of the 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) components after they have been recycled multiple times. Additionally, virgin polylactic acid was supplemented with fly ash from the thermal power plant, and the material's behavior was examined after it was recycled on multiple times. By means of different tests, the impacts of filler addition on the mechanical behavior of the recycled materials are investigated. Using various forms including broken pieces, flakes, and fine powders, the filament extrusion was performed using used polylactic acid material during recycling. Under multiple recycling conditions, the mechanical characteristics of the polylactic acid and fly ash added polylactic (PLA-FA)were investigated. This work also investigates the impact of the polymer's particulate size during the filament extrusion process. After recycling, it was found that the fine powder additions during the extrusion process provided high tensile strength of 32.61 MPa and flexural strength of 47.32 MPa for the PLA specimens. After recycling processes, the maximum tensile strength of 25.64 MPa and flexural strength of 50.22 MPa were found in fly ash enriched PLA. In contrast, the hardness of both PLA and fly ash-included PLA increased following each recycling procedure. Multiple recycling of PLA material turned the ductile material into brittle material by means of amorphous phase emergence. When compared to other particle sizes which were bigger in size, the specimens developed with filaments extruded with fine powder showed maximum results in all the tests. The tensile strength of PLA material decreased by 17.25%, while the tensile strength of PLA-FA material decreased by 21.35% after recycling. In PLA, the flexural strength drop following three recycling was 17.56% while in PLA-FA material it was 9.01%. After three times of material recycling, the hardness increased by 3.52% in PLA and by 2.48% in PLA-FA

AB Geopolymers (GPs) are inorganic binders synthesised from reactive aluminosilicate materials such as metakaolin, fly ash, and blast furnace slag, using strongly alkaline solutions at room temperature. They are more environmentally friendly than Portland cement and exhibit high hardness, weathering resistance, thermal stability, and precise mouldability. These properties make them suitable for additive manufacturing (AM) and specialised underwater applications, such as encapsulating hazardous substances or stabilising corroding shipwrecks. This study investigates the compressive strength of metakaolin-based GP reinforced with recycled carbon fibres, comparing performance in different water environments over time. Samples were produced by mould casting in air, manual underwater extrusion, and AM via material extrusion with chemical reaction bonding (MEX-CRB) in air. The 3D-printed and mould-cast samples produced in air were stored for up to 3 months in different water environments with varying salt and mineral contents to assess durability, mechanical performance, and environmental impact at defined intervals. For manually printed underwater specimens, the storage period was extended to almost 6 months, with only conducted in tap water conditions. Mould-cast specimens in air reached similar to 50 MPa, while MEX-CRB samples achieved similar to 20 MPa; after 3 months in salt water, mould-cast samples retained similar to 30 MPa, whereas printed ones remained below 20 MPa. Manually printed underwater samples increased from similar to 8 MPa at casting to similar to 14-15 MPa by week 4 before stabilizing. Microstructural observations showed crack-bridging by fibres, with random orientation in cast samples improving isotropic strength, while fibre alignment and higher porosity in printed samples limited performance. The water analysis results underscore the environmentally friendly potential of GPs in reducing environmental risks and developing sustainable methods for underwater construction and hazard prevention.

AB This work presents a green design approach for a novel class of dual-curing, self-healing polymers derived from vegetable oils for additive manufacturing. The polymer network is constructed from methacrylated and epoxidized monomers derived through environmentally friendly transformations, allowing for UV-curing radical polymerization followed by thermal curing via acid-epoxy reactions. The resulting materials exhibit self-healing behavior, supporting thermal reprocessing and chemical recycling via transesterification. Designed for circularity, polymers containing the vegetable oil derivatives-methacrylated and epoxidized-reached a biobased content of up to 98% and a biobased carbon content above 77%, far exceeding industry standards. The materials also display alkaline hydrolytic degradation, aligning with end-of-life strategies under a circular economy model. Dual-curing systems achieved an epoxy conversion of over 90% and gel contents above 97%, resulting in stable polymer networks suitable for reprocessing. The formulations were successfully processed using 3D printing platforms, producing well-defined structures despite viscosities exceeding the ideal printability window. The system containing the maleinized/methacrylated grapeseed oil and epoxidized castor oil showed the most favorable behavior, with lower overcuring and the lowest critical energy (37 mJ cm- 2). Successful printing confirms the applicability of these systems.

ID ENERGY-ABSORPTION
AB The recycling of resources is an important measure to achieve circular economy and sustainable development. In this paper, a sustainable filled structure was proposed and realized by combining recycled empty beverage cans with eco-friendly multi-cell fillers. Quasi-static axial compressions were carried out to characterize the energy absorption performance and synergistic effect of the filled tubes. Experimental results showed that the crashworthiness of sustainable filled structures varied with both filling densities and materials. With the increase in filling density, the specific energy absorption of the filled tubes presented an upward trend. With the variation in filling materials, the filled tubes exhibited different crashworthiness performances. The PLA multi-cell filled tube could withstand larger external force and exhibited higher SEA values, with a maximum value of 9.64 J/g. The PLAS multi-cell filled tube showed excellent loading stability and lower ULC value, with a minimum value of 10%. These findings provided valuable insights for designing novel sustainable energy absorption structures.

ID PERCEPTION
AB Material selection in additive manufacturing (AM) is typically driven by the need to meet specific functional characteristics, often resulting in objects with limited user experiential interpretation. With the advent of new materials and recycling techniques in AM, it is crucial to understand the sensory and emotional responses these materials can evoke. While the literature extensively covers the mechanical properties of 3D printed objects, a notable gap exists in studies focusing on user interaction and perception. This research addresses this gap by applying the material driven design (MDD) methodology to a case study that explores a new mixture of waste material from a polymer bed powder fusion process. To ensure a reliable and systematic approach, we integrated statistical tools such as Goodness of Fit, Pairwise comparison, ANOVA, and interval graphs into the MDD. We conducted a comprehensive study involving 42 participants, using a vocabulary of 65 descriptors from the Ma2E4 toolkit for experiential characterization. The study's findings resulted in a proposed process that made it possible to categorize and rank products into eight distinct families, identifying 36 potential objects. One of these objects was selected and, following a design process, fabricated using binder jetting technology. This research emphasizes the importance of incorporating user experience in AM and highlights the potential of sustainable waste utilization to advance the field. By focusing on functional and experiential aspects, we can develop 3D-printed items that enhance performance and engage users more effectively.

AB The purpose of this research is to identify how to better handle the new trends in collaborative production and to understand how to improve the efficiency of a distributed virtual team. In order to achieve these goals, a cloud-based collaborative manufacturing platform was developed, for educational purposes. This platform, intends to simulate the entire product life cycle, in a virtual environment, combining the latest software tools available on the market. The collaborative product development platform is divided in 12 stages based on the product life cycle management (PLM) steps. It starts from a market study that leads to the concept creation, reverse engineering and product design. The next phase involves virtual testing and virtual manufacturing for the previously designed product. After these simulations the platform leads to rapid prototyping (3D printing) and a physical inspection of the 3D printed product. The final stages of the platform are marketing, client feedback, recycle and improvement. In order to improve the collaborative working environment, augmented reality is applied for almost all the stages of the platform, starting from the "concept creation" to the "marketing" stage. The augmented reality used consists in 3D CAD models or other digital information superimposed over environment. This collaborative platform is used by groups of students (which simulate a geographically dispersed virtual team) to develop new products using the PLM steps.

AB Polyurethane (PU) foams are used in various automotive applications due to their low cost and weight and highly tunable mechanical and physical properties. This article explores the effect of adding recycled thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) and recycled thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) powder collected from 3D printing waste as filler material on thermal stability and mechanical, physical, and sound absorption properties of flexible PU foam. The incorporation of TPE powder at low filler content, 2.5 wt%, increased the compression modulus by over 140%, tear resistance by over 25%, and Young's Modulus by 50% compared to the control. The addition of 2.5 wt% TPU powder increased the compression modulus by 61%, tear resistance by 31%, and Young's Modulus by 84%. The addition of TPU powder at 2.5 wt% showed improvement in sound absorption of plane waves (up to 20% at 2500 Hz) for a frequency range of 50-3500 Hz. Adding an additive manufacturing waste stream into PU foam as a filler reduced waste to landfill and created a superior foam product. This article exemplifies the benefits of creating a closed-loop plastic industry to improve polymer materials and protect the earth.

AB In today's technology, additive manufacturing has evolved over the year that commonly known as 3D printing. Currently, additive manufacturing have been applied for many industries such as for automotive, aerospace, medical and other commercial product. The technologies are supported by materials for the manufacturing process to produce high quality product. Plus, additive manufacturing technologies has been growth from the lowest to moderate and high technology to fulfil manufacturing industries obligation. Initially from simple 3D printing such as fused deposition modelling (FDM), poly-jet, inkjet printing, to selective laser sintering (SLS), and electron beam melting (EBM). However, the high technology of additive manufacturing nowadays really needs high investment to carry out the process for fine products. There are three foremost type of material which is polymer, metal and ceramic used for additive manufacturing application, and mostly they were in the form of wire feedstock or powder. In circumstance, it is crucial to recognize the characteristics of each type of materials used in order to understand the behaviours of the materials on high temperature application via additive manufacturing. Therefore, this review aims to provide excessive inquiry and gather the necessary information for further research on additive material materials for high temperature application. This paper also proposed a new material based on powder glass, which comes from recycled tempered glass from automotive industry, having a huge potential to be applied for high temperature application. The technique proposed for additive manufacturing will minimize some cost of modelling with same quality of products compare to the others advanced technology used for high temperature application.

AB Dissolving microneedles (DMNs) represent promising platforms for painless transdermal drug delivery and biosensing, yet integrating multifunctionality with sustainable recyclability via photo-curable additive manufacturing strategy remains challenging. Here we report a multifunctional, pioneering 3D-printed DMNs patch combining a ternary polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) system with a recyclable eutectogel backing layer. DMNs, formulated with biocompatible choline chloride, itaconic acid, and N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone, enable rapid photopolymerization and excellent mechanical strength for effective skin penetration. Chitosanbased glucose-responsive nanoparticles incorporated into the DMNs facilitate controlled and responsive drug release, demonstrating in diabetic rats a rapid blood glucose reduction to 18.7 % of initial levels within 3 h postadministration, sustained for 4 h while minimizing hypoglycemic risk. The conductive, adhesive, and antibacterial eutectogel backing layer offers superior properties for wound dressing and wearable sensors, also serving as a real-time health monitor for human movements. In diabetic mouse models, the CHPG-TA@CUR-DMN@NPs system achieved 68.08 % wound closure by day 10, significantly accelerating healing with reduced inflammation and scarring. The backing layer is designed for easy dissolution and recycling after use, highlighting the ecofriendly and cost-effective nature of our all-in-one integrated multi-material DMNs platform.

AB In recent years, the use of three-dimensional printing to create construction components has advanced quickly; it is possible now to simplify construction, increase speed, and lower cost while using natural resources responsibly. It also allows us to use recycled material to produce building envelopes while increasing design flexibility. However, the thermal performance of building materials must be characterized to achieve the necessary energy efficiency of the building envelopes. This study aims to develop, produce, and calibrate a hot box calorimeter at a reasonable price for thermal testing components building envelope. The heat loss through these components using a hot box can be measured in a lab to get an idea of the thermal performance of the building envelopes. In order to evaluate and analyze the thermal perfor-mance of various 3D-printed building brick samples made in the labs, this study explains the design and creation of an inexpensive hot box. The hot box can conduct a conventional thermal experiment, which involves monitoring heat flux, surface temperatures, and air temperatures. The testing process, instrumentation, test conditions, and validation of the new metering box are all covered in the article. The U-value of the brand-new lattice-based 3D printed building blocks was afterward determined using the validated new hot box. It was observed that the U-values values of 1.04 W/m2.K and 0.99 W/m2.K, respectively, for small components utilizing developed hot box and larger lattice panels using commercial equipment, with a maximum variance of 5%. It highlights the dependability of the hot box apparatus, which is also made affordable to operate by using less material for specimen preparation and less energy to maintain the temperature in the hot and cold chambers. Its small size also makes setup and thermal testing of construction materials simple. (c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and mechanical properties, poly-lactic acid (PLA) is a leading biomaterial for numerous applications, especially for fused deposition modeling and fused filament fabrication. Nonetheless, the absence of a comprehensive recycling strategy may emerge as a significant source of plastic pollution in the future. Indeed, the polymer undergoes deterioration during melt recycling, resulting in a decrease in some mechanical properties that can compromise recyclability. To improve the properties of recycled PLA, the utilization of organic fillers coming from renewable materials can be considered as a sustainable solution. The objective of this work is then to evaluate the effect of recycling (reprocessing) on a virgin raw material as well as on biocomposites based on spent coffee grounds (incorporating 5% of spend coffee grounds in weight). The different types of filaments are extruded and re-extruded and characterized under tensile, melt flow index, and hardness tests. The results show that the increase in the number of extrusions whether for virgin PLA or the composite contributes to the diameter fluctuation. Regarding the tensile properties, the rise in the frequency of recycling shows a weakness in the tensile strength and the elongation at break. On the other hand, Young's modulus values exhibit fluctuations. Concerning the addition of the spent coffee grounds filler, no major enhancement is observed in the tensile strength and the elongation at break, which is attributed to the poor adhesion between the matrix and the filler. The recycling process affects the hardness values of PLA, leading to an increase in these values, as well as those of the composite, which can be associated with the increased crystallinity caused by the recycling process and the SCG incorporation.

AB High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) combined with H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has only been demonstrated over a small spectral range so far. The self-printing of chromatographic plates with a modified 3D slurry printer allowed the operator to influence the composition of the adsorbent slurry and thus the purity of the adsorbent layer. The combination of such self-printed, binder-free HPTLC plates with inkjet-driven sample application made possible submicromole-scaled analytical H-1 NMR spectroscopy. This was proven using pure HPTLC adsorbents. For comparison, commercial silica gel HPTLC plates were purified by pre-development with solvents for spectroscopy, whereas commercial silica gel HPTLC particles were self-printed on the glass plate after purification under solvent pressure in a recycled HPLC cartridge. Evaluating the signals from different treatments, seven background signals disappeared in the proton spectra and three were reduced to a minimum by use of pre-developed commercial HPTLC plates. In the case of the self-printed, binder-free HPTLC plates made of purified adsorbent, most of the spectral background signals were reduced to a minimum, thus these spectra showed the highest cleanness and most pure analyte proton spectra. For the first time, the full H-1 NMR spectroscopy range was made available after an HPTLC separation. This proof of principle opens the avenue for submicromole-scaled analytical H-1 NMR spectroscopy.

AB Polyethylene (PE) is a widely used thermoplastic valued for its low cost, chemical resistance, recyclability, and good mechanical properties. PE makes up about one-third of the global plastic production. Recent advances in the field of additive manufacturing, especially material extrusion (MEX), have initiated interest in incorporating PE. However, using PE in such applications is challenging due to the polymer's semicrystalline nature, which causes significant shrinkage when cooled and limits chain diffusion, affecting the adhesion between the deposited layers. PE's non-polar character can also reduce the adhesion of the 3D-printed part to the printing bed. This paper analyzes the current progress in using PE in MEX, attempts to correlate PE's thermo-rheological properties with its 3D printability, and discusses the challenges associated with PE within the nozzle, postdeposition on the bed, and in the stand-off region between them. Additionally, the paper highlights the strategies to overcome these challenges to improve PE's printability in MEX by modulating the physicochemical properties of PE via incorporating fillers and nanofillers and blending with other polymers. Finally, future research directions are proposed to aid the design of PE-based feedstocks, which could also enhance plastic recycling.

AB Low-grade waste heat recovery has significant importance to energy saving and emission reduction. Due to the lack of cost-effective heat recovery technology, a lot of low-grade heat is wasted. In this paper, performances of 3D-printed flat-plate PHPs and computerized numerical control (CNC) machined flat-plate PHPs without and with thermoelectric generators (TEGs) under four recycling modes were studied. The effects of the type and number of flat-plate PHPs, condenser section length, recycling mode, flow arrangement, velocity and temperature of hot/cold air, the number and layer number of TEGs on the performances of the waste heat recovery system were studied to maximize its performance. Results indicate that the performance of the heat recovery system with CNC machined flat-plate PHP is generally better than that with 3D-printed flat-plate PHP, and their maximum effective thermal conductivities can reach 585 and 541 W/(m center dot K), respectively. Performances of flat-plate PHPs based waste heat recovery system can be improved by using slotted fins, increasing the condenser section length and flat-plate PHPs number. For the air-to-air heat recovery system with three flat-plate PHPs, the maximum heat transfer rate and heat recovery rate can be up to 303 W and 85.3%, respectively. As for heat-to-power waste heat recovery under Mode 3, flat-plate PHP coupled with three TEGs can achieve its maximum open-circuit voltage of 7.6 V and output power of 1.98 W. Preliminary economic analysis proves that flat-plate PHPs based waste heat recovery system displays good economic benefits. These results may be helpful in designing a cost-effective flat-plate PHPs based low-grade waste heat recovery system.

AB Traditional short-chain terephthalic polyesters such as poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) are among the most produced plastics in today's polymer industry, while their large-scale chemical recycling has been a long-standing challenge. The long-chain polyesters have shown good recyclability under mild conditions, whereas the structure-property relationships and chemical recycling performance of long-chain terephthalic polyesters are still unclear. Herein, we synthesized a series of medium/long-chain terephthalic polyesters with different methylene sequence lengths (CH2 number in diol monomer n CH2 = 6, 8, 10, 12) and investigated their thermal properties, crystallization behavior, mechanical properties, and chemical recycling performance. All terephthalic polyesters show good crystallizability; their melting temperature decreases, and melting enthalpy increases gradually as n CH2 increases from 2 to 12. All polyesters adopt a triclinic crystal lattice while slightly different crystalline lamellar structures. The medium/long-chain terephthalic polyesters exhibit improved ductility and good melt processability, enabling them to be used as three-dimensional (3D) printing materials. In addition, the medium- and long-chain terephthalic polyesters are chemically recyclable and can depolymerize under mild conditions (e.g., 140 degrees C in methanol). The monomers obtained by depolymerization can be reused to synthesize again the according polyesters. This study provides new inspiration for developing sustainable high-performance polyesters with great industrial potential.

AB This paper consists in a review of environmental issues of additive manufacturing technologies, mainly in those related to fused deposition modelling. The versatility, reduction of equipment costs due to patents expiring and the great flexibility offered by 3D printers have driven the amazing increase of these technologies in the last years. On the other hand, the democratization of additive manufacturing also poses some issues regarding environment; it is important to also have into account the potential effects of these technologies in the environment, coming from energy consumption, materials, and wastes produced. A review of different research works dealing with environmental impact of additive manufacturing, such as products' life cycle assessment, energy and materials consumption, and particles and gases releases (mainly due to health issues), has been performed. The assessment performed has helped highlighting the importance of environmental issues in additive manufacturing, according to the number of published papers. The main findings are the importance of establishing a method for applying eco-design principles taking into account the specific features of additive manufacturing.

AB The flexural behavior of sandwich structures produced through the foam additive manufacturing (FAM) process was examined. FAM allows the creation of intricate foamed structures with varying morphology and density gradients using a physical blowing agent (PBA). This technology facilitates the production of complex, engineered parts made from a single material intentionally designed with different densities and mechanical properties in various sections, as well as enabling gradient structures. As foams are widely used in industrial applications for composite sandwich structures, the study aims to investigate the mechanical behavior under three-points loading of 3D printed foam sandwich structures produced with various printing parameters, resulting in distinct densities and mechanical properties. The failure modalities were analyzed by infrared thermography and microscopy. The results highlight the influence of printing parameters on the foam's characteristics. The bending tests provide insights into the foam's strength and energy absorption capabilities. Gibson-Ashby curve was built to provide the previsional mechanical strength of the foamed sandwich structures, based on their core shape and density. These findings contribute to optimizing FAM parameters for crafting lightweight, durable components with customized mechanical properties, achieved using monomaterial structures. This approach makes recycling easier and less impactful, benefiting industries such as aviation and automotive.

AB Dense topologically interlocked panels are made of well-ordered, stiff building blocks interacting mainly by frictional contact. Under mechanical loads, the deformation of the individual blocks is small, but they can slide and rotate collectively, generating high strength, toughness, impact resistance, and damage tolerance. Here, we expand this con-struction strategy to fully dense, 3D architectured materials made of space filling building blocks or "grains." We used mechanical vibrations to assemble 3D printed rhombic dodecahedral and truncated octahedral grains into fully dense face-centered cubic and body-centered cubic "granular crystals." Triaxial compression tests revealed that these granular crystals are up to 25 times stronger than randomly packed spheres and that after testing, the grains can be recycled into new samples with no loss of strength. They also displayed a rich set of mechanisms: nonlinear deformations, crystal plasticity reminiscent of atomistic mechanisms, geometrical hardening, cross-slip, shear-induced dilatancy, and microbuckling. A most intriguing mechanism involved a pressure-dependent "granular crystal plasticity" with interlocked slip planes that completely forbid slip along certain loading directions. We captured these phenomena using a three-length scale theoretical model which agreed well with the experiments. Once fully understood and harnessed, we envision that these mechanisms will lead to 3D architectured materials with unu-sual and attractive combinations of mechanical performances as well as capabilities for repair, reshaping, on-site alterations, and recycling of the building blocks. In addition, these granular crystals could serve as "model materials" to explore unusual atomic scale deformation mechanisms, for example, non-Schmid plasticity.

AB The discovery and development of contemporary concrete have made substantial contributions to the industrial revolution and urbanization over the last two centuries. The tremendous use of concrete results in a large amount of solid waste and considerable carbon emissions. The effort on waste concrete recycling is significant and vital in light of the national strategy of "carbon peaking and neutrality". The previous research on the recycled concrete focused on the traditional ideas of aggregate substitution and parameter modification to normal concrete. However, new ideas for waste concrete recycling and low-carbon application of recycled concrete should be further investigated.
   The theory and methods of concrete composition, decomposition, and recycling are examined. In general, the synthesis of concrete necessitates managing the characteristics of raw ingredients to increase overall performance. A mature concrete synthesis system was established by the steady physical qualities of sand and gravels, the hydration reaction of cementitious materials, and scientific combination design. Furthermore, the changes in the physical qualities of concrete components provide a theoretical foundation for crushing and sieving to produce recycled materials.
   To make recycled concrete (RC), recycled aggregates (RAs) and recycled powder are employed. However, the use of RC is complicated by the uncertainty of raw material sources, variations in the hydration process and microstructures, and discrepancies in basic attributes. Multi-way modification strategies have been developed to improve the qualities of RAs and RC to realize the conversion of difficult-to-control wastes into controllable recycled materials. The qualities of RC are improved and the variability of these features is reduced by incorporating artificial intelligence technologies into the mixture design of RC based on big data. In addition, three criteria for the preparation of RC are proposed, including a safe application criterion, an economically durable criterion, and a low-carbon sustainable criterion, to encourage the promotion of RC and improve its economic and environmental benefits.
   For the further development of waste concrete recycling, full recycled aggregate concrete (FRAC), which uses 100% recycled coarse and fine aggregates, is proposed as a new generation of RC to increase the economic and low-carbon benefits of RC. Meanwhile, alkali-activated cementitious materials are being used to prepare recycled aggregate concrete for even further carbon reduction, and 3D printing RC technology is being used to reduce carbon emission and fresh concrete waste during construction. We also suggest a specific concrete design concept for recycling, in which decomposition agents (such as nano-TiO2) could be employed to easily peel off the attached old mortar from RAs during microwave treatment. The photoelectric effect of nano-TiO2 could also be used to make concrete with oxygen-releasing properties.
   The low-carbon properties of concrete would be a consensus to accomplish its green and high performance with the development of the construction materials sector. Waste concrete recycling is beneficial to enhance waste concrete's resource reuse value and low-carbon potential, as well as create a concrete circular economy development model.

AB This study introduces a double-recycling approach by incorporating Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) and Ecigarette butts (E-CBs) into Stone Mastic Asphalt (SMA) mixtures, aimed at enhancing sustainability in the pavement industry. While the commonly used method involves the direct addition of recycling agents to asphalt mixtures, this study explores the encapsulation of recycling agents within fibre pellets. To evaluate this approach, two fibre pellets were produced from E-CBs using 3D printed tube moulds: Pellet I, containing only E-CBs, and Pellet II, comprising E-CBs combined with a recycling agent. Three mixtures with 40 % RAP were prepared for evaluation: one utilizing Pellet II; and the other two containing either Pellet I or cellulose fibre, both with recycling agents added directly. A non-RAP mixture using cellulose fibres was selected as control. The cellulose fibre content was 0.3 %, while shredded E-CBs in Pellet I or II was set at 0.4 % by aggregate weight. Based on the mixtures tested in this study, results revealed that all RAP-containing mixtures exhibited higher compactability, tensile strength, stiffness, and fatigue resistance compared to the non-RAP mixture, with excellent water resistance across all samples. Notably, the encapsulated recycling agent in Pellet II enhanced fatigue performance, with P2RAP showing a fatigue life approximately six times that of P1RAP at a 1.5 kN load amplitude, while maintaining workability, tensile strength, stiffness, rutting resistance and low-temperature cracking resistance similar to the traditional method of adding recycling agents. These findings highlight the effectiveness of recycling agent-encapsulated fibre pellets derived from E-CBs in RAP-containing mixtures, with potential improvements in fatigue resistance.

AB In the past three decades, significant studies have been reported on successive recycling (SR) of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic-based composites. However, SR of thermosetting polymers such as melamine formaldehyde (MF), bakelite, etc., is still a challenge in commercial terms, mainly due to high energy requirements. This study highlights the effect of SR for selected composition/ proportion of ABS (87.5% by wt.) and MF (12.5% by wt.) as a composite based on the mechanical, rheological, thermal and Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. The study revealed that the tensile properties of ABS-MF composite deteriorate with each SR. The peak strength (PS) and modulus of toughness (MoT) (without recycling) were observed as 42.45 MPa and 1.60 MPa, which was reduced to 18.47 MPa and 0.1459 MPa after 03 SR. A continuous rise in melt flow index (MFI) was observed from 10.46 (without recycling) to 11.924 g/(10min) after 03 SR. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of samples supports the thermal stability of ABS-MF recycled composite after 03 SR. The printability of ABS-MF composite was also ensured after SR using the material extrusion (MEX) based 3D printing. FTIR analysis of ABS-MF composite shows a significant rise in transmittance of infrared radiation after SR, making the composite suitable for sensor applications. Further, the results of the impedance analyzer show an enhanced dielectric constant of ABS-MF composite after SR, which is ideal for sensor miniaturization.

AB To meet sustainable development demands, reducing non-renewable resource consumption while promoting material recycling has become imperative. For thermosetting resins, the commercialization of high-performance bio-based alternatives remains challenging due to biomass cost constraints and processing limitations. Herein, we demonstrate a facile method for large-scale preparation of a eugenol-derived thermoset monomer (EUEP) characterized by high yield, high purity, and low waste generation. Through acrylation modification, a fully bio-based resin system with dual UV-thermal curing capability was developed. The material's initial shape stabilization was rapidly achieved via UV-initiated radical polymerization, while subsequent thermally induced transesterification allowed precise modulation of covalent crosslinking network density. This sequential curing approach enabled controllable tuning of the resin's mechanical properties, achieving tensile strength ranging from 2 to 23 MPa with the corresponding elongation at break varying between 5% and 18%. Leveraging dynamic ester bond exchange at interfaces, the thermoset exhibited intrinsic crack-repairing and self-adhesion functionalities. This methodology establishes a novel strategy for developing fully bio-based reworkable resin systems, demonstrating significant potential for enhancing 3D printing process efficiency.

AB With the development of the internet-of-things for applications such as wearables and packaging, a new class of electronics is emerging, characterized by the sheer number of forecast units and their short service-life. Projected to reach 27 billion units in 2021, connected devices are generating an exponentially increasing amount of electronic waste (e-waste). Fueled by the growing e-waste problem, the field of sustainable electronics is attracting significant interest. Today, standard energy-storage technologies such as lithium-ion or alkaline batteries still power most of smart devices. While they provide good performance, the nonrenewable and toxic materials require dedicated collection and recycling processes. Moreover, their standardized form factor and performance specifications limit the designs of smart devices. Here, exclusively disposable materials are used to fully print nontoxic supercapacitors maintaining a high capacitance of 25.6 F g(-1) active material at an operating voltage up to 1.2 V. The presented combination of digital material assembly, stable high-performance operation, and nontoxicity has the potential to open new avenues within sustainable electronics and applications such as environmental sensing, e-textiles, and healthcare.

AB The electrochemical reduction of CO2 (eCO(2)R) from carbon capture solutions, such as (bi)carbonate, offers a promising pathway for energy-efficient carbon recycling compared to traditional gas-phase approaches. However, the development of optimized membrane-electrode designs remains a critical challenge for advancing this technology toward commercial viability. In this study, we present a novel integration of 3D-printed microlattice carbon electrodes with bipolar membranes (BPMs) for bicarbonate electrolysis. We used projection micro-stereolithography (P mu SL) to fabricate unique free-standing carbon electrodes with nature-inspired honeycomb architectures. Silver nanoparticles were deposited onto the electrodes via chronoamperometry under varying conditions of deposition potential (-0.1, -0.2, and -0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl), deposition time (0 to 1200 s), and catalyst loading (0 to 0.7 mg/cm(2)). The optimal BPM-3D electrode assembly significantly enhanced CO production efficiency, achieving a Faradaic efficiency for CO (FECO) of 38 % - a 22 times increase over uncoated electrodes (1.7 %) - at a current density of 12.5 mA/cm(2). This configuration, prepared at -0.2 V for 900 s with an Ag loading of 0.5 mg/cm(2), exhibited improved catalytic activity because of the formation of highly active Ag nanostructures. The electrode demonstrated an Integrated Catalytic Performance Index (ICPI) of approximately 150 mA/Vmg at 50 mA/cm(2). Stability tests revealed minimal degradation over 14 h of operation, affirming the durability of the Ag-coated 3D electrodes. A preliminary techno-economic analysis projects that CO production costs could be reduced by optimizing Faradaic efficiency (FE) and catalyst loading under scaled conditions. This work lays the foundation for integrating 3D printing and BPM technology for sustainable eCO(2)R. However, achieving high selectivity and stability at >100 mA/cm(2) remains challenging, requiring optimized electrode design and interface engineering for commercial viability.

AB Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is a well-known additive manufacturing technique that builds 3D complex structures by sintering powder particles together upon laser irradiation. In the polymer field, thermoset resins are a popular choice for a plethora of applications due to their great mechanical properties and thermochemical stability. However, due to their irreversible crosslinked nature, they are hard to be processed using SLS. Herein, a covalently crosslinked polymer thermoset based on thermally reversible Diels-Alder (DA) bonds has been printed using SLS. The thermoreversible network exhibits a glassy behavior due to its high crosslinked density and glass transition temperature and was successfully milled into a suitable particle size, morphology and flow for SLS applications. At low temperatures, the DA equilibrium shifts towards the formation of the DA crosslinks, while at high temperatures the DA adducts gradually dissociate, allowing flow and reprocessability at temperatures above 131C. Furthermore, the printed parts exhibit healing ability when heated above their glass transition temperature, reaching a fracture stress and Young's Modulus of 25.4 MPa and 1416 MPa, respectively. Thus, the dynamic nature of the network extends the build lifetime upon damage and also brings the opportunity of recycling or reprocessing, enhancing circularity compared to classic thermosets.

AB The production, optimisation, physicochemical, and electroanalytical characterisation of a low-cost electrically conductive additive manufacturing filament made with recycled poly(lactic acid) (rPLA), castor oil, carbon black, and graphite (CB-G/PLA) is reported. Through optimising the carbon black and graphite loading, the best ratio for conductivity, low material cost, and printability was found to be 60% carbon black to 40% graphite. The maximum composition within the rPLA with 10 wt% castor oil was found to be an overall nanocarbon loading of 35 wt% which produced a price of less than 0.01 pound per electrode whilst still offering excellent low-temperature flexibility and reproducible printing. The additive manufactured electrodes produced from this filament offered excellent electrochemical performance, with a heterogeneous electron (charge) transfer rate constant, k(0) calculated to be (2.6 +/- 0.1) x 10(-3) cm s(-1) compared to (0.46 +/- 0.03) x 10(-3) cm s(-1) for the commercial PLA benchmark. The additive manufactured electrodes were applied to the determination of beta-estradiol, achieving a sensitivity of 400 nA mu M-1, a limit of quantification of 70 nM, and a limit of detection of 21 nM, which compared excellently to other reports in the literature. The system was then applied to the detection of ss-estradiol within four real water samples, including tap, bottled, river, and lake water, where recoveries between 95 and 109% were obtained. Due to the ability to create high-performance filament at a low material cost (0.06 pound per gram) and through the use of more sustainable materials such as recycled polymers, bio-based plasticisers, and naturally occurring graphite, additive manufacturing will have a permanent place within the electroanalysis arsenal in the future.

AB Next-generation polymeric membranes must be derived from more environmentally friendly materials that have similar solubility and miscibility properties as their predecessors to form permeable and selective membranes. Bio-derived polymers, recycled plastics, and eco-friendly solvents have been demonstrated to produce membranes with similar permeability and selectivity as conventional counterparts, though matching membrane durability and cost-effectiveness remain as future research challenges. Slot die coating and 3D printing have been demonstrated to show the scalability of membrane fabrication. Life cycle assessments have become valuable tools in estimating the total environmental impacts of the manufacturing process and characterizing the sustainability of new materials. Recent advances have shortened the gap between materials innovation research and commercial application.

AB A novel three-step process consisting of disc tube reverse osmosis (DTRO), Fenton oxidation, and low temperature crystallization is described for the treatment of printing and dyeing wastewater. The DTRO step was used to further concentrate the wastewater obtained from a nanofiltration (NF) treatment. The desalinated water can be directly reused in the production process, and the COD, TOC, TDS, and SO42- concentrations of the concentrated wastewater were above 1500 mg/L, 500 mg/L, 150 g/L, and 100 g/L, respectively. The concentrated wastewater was then treated by Fenton oxidation, and the COD, TOC, and chroma removal rates in this step were over 80%, 80%, and nearly 100%, respectively. Finally, when the crystallization end point temperature was 0 degrees C, the recovery and purity of the product were above 60% and 99%, respectively. For the small amount of Cl- contained in the crystalline mother liquor, the Cl- and SO42- in the mother liquor were separated by NF and then sent back to the DTRO step to be re-concentrated. The degradation of organic compounds in wastewater was studied by UV-Vis spectroscopy, three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM), and total organic carbon analyzer. The crystalline products were characterized by X-ray diffraction. The results showed that this new coupling process can realize high reuse of printing and dyeing wastewater.

AB Plastic waste pollution, including non-biodegradable landfills, leaching of toxic chemicals into soil and waterways, and emission of toxic gases into the atmosphere, is significantly affecting our environment. Conventional plastic waste recycling approaches generally produce lower value materials compared to the original plastic or recover inefficient heat energy. Lately, upcycling or the valorization approach has emerged as a sustainable solution to transform plastic waste into value-added products. In this review, we present an overview of recent advancements in plastic waste upcycling, such as vitrimerization, nanocomposite fabrication, additive manufacturing, catalytic transformation, and industrial biotechnology, envisaged with technical challenges, future developments, and new circular economy opportunities.

AB Graphene/polymer composites have a wide range of applications, such as energy storage, 3D printing, sensors, water purification, and heat dissipation materials due to their enhanced mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. One major challenge is graphene's tendency to aggregate due to strong Van der Waals interactions (5.9 kJ mol-1), which hinders uniform dispersion in the polymer matrix. Therefore, this study focused on improving the barrier properties of recycled polymer matrices, such as Nylon 6, Nylon 66, and polyethylene terephthalate, against moisture using chemically modified graphene nanofillers (GNPs). The nanocomposite films were prepared based on the variation of GNPs' loadings and thicknesses. The results obtained from scanning electron microscope revealed that the addition of GNPs resulted in the formation of irregular protuberances on the fracture surface of the polymer matrices, with graphene fillers dispersed within the matrices. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) for samples with 0.5 mm was reduced by the addition of GNPs. The moisture barrier properties of recycled polymer matrices are improved by adding O2- and NH2- to GNPs, with interfacial interactions between the fillers and the matrices dependent on the functionalization type.

AB Muscle-powered, biological, microelectro-mechanical system is promising for actuator and biosensor applications. Functional conjugation between the cells, tissues, and biomolecules to the microdevice is crucial for this application. Bioprinting as an enabling technology possesses the advantages of high throughput, digital control, and highly accurate delivery of various biological factors to the desired locations for numerous applications such as 3D tissue fabrication. We have now evaluated the feasibility of the precise placement of mouse myoblasts onto micro-sized cantilevers. The evenly aligned printed cells fused with each other and formed mature myotubes after only 4 days. In contrast, it took more than 14 days for randomly deposited cells to do so. The printed myotubes were functional and responded to the electrical stimulation synchronously. Furthermore, the integrated Bio-MEMS device responded to the chemical stimulation spontaneously which demonstrated the potential as a functional biosensor. The contractility of the system was recovered quickly after the removal of the chemical stimulation, which indicated the flexibility of this system and the recycling potential.

AB Purpose - This paper aims to develop flame-retardant (FR) polyamide 12 (PA12) nanocomposite from regenerated powder via selective laser sintering (SLS), an additive manufacturing technique.Design/methodology/approach - First, the morphology, processibility, thermal and mechanical properties of PA12 regenerated powder, consisting of 50 wt% new and 50 wt% recycled powder, as well as corresponding printed specimens, were evaluated to characterize the effects of previous SLS processing. Second, flame-retardant PA12 was developed by incorporating both single and binary halogen-free flame retardants into the regenerated powder.Findings - It was found that the printed specimens from regenerated powder had much higher tensile and impact properties compared to specimens made from new powder, which is attributed to better particulate fusion and coalescence realized in higher temperature SLS printing. The effect of FRs on thermal, mechanical and flame retardant properties of the PA12 composites/nanocomposites was investigated systematically. It was found that the nanoclay, as a synergist, improved both flame-retardant and mechanical properties of PA12. UL94 standard rating of V-0 was achieved for the printed nanocomposite by incorporating 1 wt% nanoclay into 15 wt% phosphinates FR. Moreover, on average, the tensile and impact strength of the nanocomposite were increased by 26.13% and 17.09%, respectively, in XY, YZ and Z printing orientations as compared to the equivalent flame retardant composite with 20 wt% of the phosphinates FR.Originality/value - This paper fulfills the need to develop flame retardant parts via SLS technology with waste feedstock. It also addresses the challenge of developing flame retardant materials without obviously compromising the mechanical properties by making use of the synergistic effect of nanoclay and organic phosphinates.

DT Review

AB In recent years, there has been a remarkable development in the technology and legislation related to electric and autonomous vehicles (i.e., EVs/AVs). This technological advancement requires the deployment of the most up-to-date supporting infrastructure to achieve safe operation. Further infrastructure is needed for Level 5 vehicles, namely the introduction of super-fast wireless 5G technology. To achieve harmony between the rapid technological advancement of EVs/AVs and environmental preservation, enacting legislation related to their sustainable use is vital. Thus, this manuscript provides a review of the technological development of EVs/AVs, with a special focus on carbon footprints and the implementation of additive manufacturing using recycled materials. While EVs have a 12.13% increased carbon footprint compared to conventional vehicles, AVs with basic and advanced intelligence features have an increased carbon footprint of 41.43% and 99.65%, respectively. This article emphasizes that the integration of 3D-printed components has the potential to offset this impact with a substantial 60% reduction. As a result, custom-made solutions involving 3D printing are explored, leading to greater speed, customization, and cost-effectiveness for EVs/AVs. This article also lists the advantages and disadvantages of the existing legislation in Spain, the United Kingdom, and the western Balkans, demonstrating various approaches to promoting electric mobility and the development of autonomous vehicles. In Spain, initiatives like the MOVES program incentivize EV adoption, while the UK focuses on expanding the EV market and addressing concerns about EVs' quiet operation. In the western Balkans, the adoption of legislation lags behind, with limited incentives and infrastructure for EVs. To boost sales, legal mechanisms are necessary to reduce costs and improve accessibility, in addition to offering subsidies for the purchase of EVs. To this end, an analysis of the incentive measures proposed for the development and use of renewable power sources for the supply of energy for EVs/AVs is presented.

AB Polypeptides are highly valued in biomedical science for their biocompatibility and biodegradability, making them valuable in drug delivery, tissue engineering, and antibacterial dressing. The diverse design of polymer chains and self-assembly techniques allow different side chains and secondary structures, enhancing their biomedical potential. However, the traditional solid powder form of polypeptides presents challenges in skin applications, shipping, and recycling, limiting their practical utility. Recent advancements in material forming methods and polypeptide synthesis have produced biomaterials with uniform, distinct shapes, improving usability. This review outlines the progress in polypeptide synthesis and material-forming methods over the past decade. The main synthesis techniques include solid-phase synthesis and ring-opening polymerization of N-carboxyanhydrides while forming methods like electrospinning, 3D printing, and coating are explored. Integrating structural design with these methods is emphasized, leading to diverse polypeptide materials with unique shapes. The review also identifies research hotspots using VOSviewer software, which are visually presented in circular packing images. It further discusses emerging applications such as drug delivery, wound healing, and tissue engineering, emphasizing the crucial role of material shape in enhancing performance. The review concludes by exploring future trends in developing distinct polypeptide shapes for advanced biomedical applications, encouraging further research.

AB We report the synthesis of new visible-light photosensitizers derived from purpurin (mono-allyl- and triallyl-purpurin), and their use as type II photoinitiating systems when associated with N-methyldiethanolamine, bis(4-methylphenyl) iodonium hexafluorophosphate or tri-functionalized thiol (trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate)) for cationic and free-radical photopolymerization, and the initiation of thiol-ene reactions. These photoinitiating systems showed good initiating properties in laminate or under air upon visible-light exposure, i.e. LED@405 nm, 455 nm, 470 nm, 530 nm, and a Xe lamp. Steady-state photolysis, electron paramagnetic resonance, fluorescence analysis and laser flash photolysis have clearly highlighted the photochemical properties of the different photoinitiating systems and proved that purpurin derivatives could act as electron donors or as proton/proton-coupled electron transfer promoters when associated with appropriate additives. For the first time, we also demonstrated the capability of triallyl purpurin to produce newly designed 3D objects by 3D photoprinting technology. Interestingly, the photosensitizers from new 3D materials incorporating triallyl-purpurin have undoubtedly shown tremendous antibacterial properties with more than 99% of inhibition of bacterial adhesion upon visible-light exposure, even after many antibacterial cycling experiments, thus showing their capability to be recycled.

AB With the upcoming limitations on gasoline-based vehicles, especially in Europe under the Paris Accord, research on electrical/hydrogen powered vehicles and lightweight alloys for lower CO2 emission has peaked. Scandium (Sc) became one of the key elements for advanced Al-based lightweight alloys due to major improvements in physical properties. Due to extreme prices and rare primary sources, recovery of Sc from available end-of-life (EoL) products has clearly became the focus of research. Al-Sc-containing 3D printing powders are one of the promising products to be utilized in the industry. To recover the critical metals from these EoL products or from the production wastes, hydrometallurgical processes are great alternatives due to possibility of elemental separation with low energy consumption. However, conventional leaching of electronegative metallic particles and alloys with a strong mineral acid can result in generation of H-2 gas and an aggressive exothermic reaction. While such a leaching process can be made safe at laboratory scale there are significant challenges at commercial scale from a control and zero harm perspective. Hence, there is a need for greener and sustainable process with easier control, lower chemical use, energy, and CO2 emission without any H-2 gas evolution. Thus, an innovative leaching approach was applied with a metal salt solution with higher reduction potential to dissolve the metallic powders with cementation of the metal from the leaching solution. Then, the target was separated and purified from the impurities via refining operations. The flexibility of end product is another advantage since metal carbonates, metal sulfates, metal oxides, metal fluorides and metal oxides could be produced via this processing route. The process is also scaled up and tested in a continuous mini-pilot scale.

AB Additive manufacturing is the technology used in medical, industrial, or lifestyle applications. The scientific literature include works reporting various manufacturing parameters' influence on changes in additive manufacturing components' mechanical behavior, especially with fused filament fabrication (FFF). The changes in mechanical strength and toughness of FFF compared to injection molding parts were studied. In the study, the FFF and injection molded parts were aged in buffered saline solution in temperature of 37 & DEG;C. The results show that by differentiating the orientation of the fibers during fabricating, it is possible to reach strength values similar to injection molded parts. Therefore, it was reported that the mechanical strength and toughness changed significantly after aging, and the FFF components lost strength more quickly than their injected alternatives. The research results can be useful during the fabrication of mechanically stable and biodegradable components, which can be more easily recycled than their injected alternatives when used with warmer temperatures and humidity. This article completes the present state of the art on the problem of environmental aging of parts produced from biodegradable materials. Especially, the research was related to the multilayer laminate structure.

AB To improve the understanding on methane storage in wet porous media under hydrate favorable conditions, hydrate formation loaded by an activated carbon bed in three three-dimensional printed containers was carried out, while the recycling performance of the activated carbon bed was also evaluated. As expected, due to low permeability of the bed, poor hydrate kinetics was observed for small particles, but this is improved by increasing the exposure of the bed. When there is hydrate formation loaded by an activated carbon bed in a container, the specific contact area governs hydrate nucleation and growth kinetics, and the accessibility of methane with inner water increases with the increase in gas-solid contact area, giving rise to fast hydrate nucleation and large methane uptake. Impressively, the hydrate induction time for container 3 is only 3.53 and 41.79% of that in container 1 under the filling ratios (volume ratio of the sample to container) of 80 and 100% separately, while the methane uptake increases by about 8% for both the scenarios. In addition, because of the migration of water to side walls, exceptional recycling performance of the activated carbon bed was also observed, and this characteristic causes the bed to be easily charged and discharged like a battery. These findings may pave the way for the application of the adsorbed natural gas technology using wet activated carbon under hydrate-favorable conditions.

AB 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) is an advanced technology in manufacturing and building sector. This technology is now a crucial component for developing cutting-edge machinery that could resolve many challenges faced by conventional building construction. Despite their benefits, the quality of materials used in 3DCP still requires further attention to meet established concrete standards. Therefore, reforming the conventional construction industry with sustainable waste sources for 3DCP technology is a strategic approach. Since the current range of 3DCP material is still restricted, expanding the selection to include more eco-friendly options could be highly beneficial. This paper aims to explores the potential in utilizing waste sources as a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) for 3DCP mixture in building construction. It reviews the recent and past research pertinently on sustainable waste (rubber, polymer, construction, industrial, recycled sand, and glass) products as supplements or additions for the 3DCP mixture. Rheological and compressive strength characteristics of the 3DCP combination are examined and contrasted with those of other waste materials. All gathered information will be examined considering the literature research to identify the combination for 3DCP to achieve improvement in building materials. Using waste as an SCM component in 3DCP mixtures supports sustainable construction practices. Waste materials have shown potential to improve the rheology (slump, workability, extrudability) and compressive strength of 3D-printed concrete. Compared to the conventional building construction method, optimising waste in a 3DCP will promote efforts to minimise waste creation and maximise the efficient use of commodities. Therefore, incorporating sustainable waste into 3DCP mixtures is a promising area of study for further research.

AB This paper presents a comparative assessment of the results of thermocatalytic recycling of polymer wastes based on polylactide, a biodegradable polymer, to a monomer (lactide), which can be used as a secondary raw material, along with primary plant resources, to produce polylac-tide. Off-grade polylactide, polylactide sheets obtained by hot pressing, a filament for 3D printing and polylactide items made by 3D printing were used as polymer wastes. Crude lactide was ob-tained with a yield of 72-83% by the destruction of polymer wastes at a temperature of 180-250 ??? in the presence of zinc oxide as a catalyst. The yield of purified lactide after crude lactide recrystalli-zation from ethanol and ethyl acetate exceeded 40%. By gas chromatography, the product was found to contain residual amounts of meso-lactide, lactic acid and lactic acid linear oligomers impurities. The influence of the type of the raw polymer on the yield and quality of the monomer was analyzed. The destruction of polylactide previously treated at a high temperature and under mechanical force (by the methods of extrusion during 3D printing and hot pressing) was charac-terized by a lower yield of crude lactide and obtaining of the monomer with a higher content of impurities capable of violating the stereoregularity and reducing the molecular weight of the pol-ymer synthesized from lactide. In order to assess the possibility of using the monomer obtained from polymer waste for the synthesis of polylactide, lactide was subjected to polymerization in the presence of stannous octoate as a catalyst. A product with a number average and weight average mo-lecular weight of about 9.7 kDa and 16.3 kDa, respectively, was obtained.

AB This study rigorously assesses the latest advancements in sustainable building materials, focusing on their classification, innovative production technologies, and performance metrics. We categorize sustainable materials into natural substances, such as bamboo and hemp; recycled products, like crushed concrete and recycled plastics; and innovative composites, including fiber-reinforced polymers. We emphasize the application of advanced manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing and automated fabrication, which significantly boost efficiency and minimize waste in the construction industry. These materials are critically evaluated using standards such as ASTM for mechanical properties and ISO for environmental impacts, affirming their practical viability and durability. However, the adoption of these materials faces obstacles like high initial costs, technical integration challenges, and stringent regulatory frameworks. We provide specific examples, such as the economic impact of switching to bio-based composites and the technical adjustments required for incorporating recycled plastics into structural applications. Looking forward, this paper delves into prospects and research directions, highlighting the need for scalability and integration into conventional construction practices to fully harness the potential of these sustainable materials. This work underscores the vital role of sustainable materials in fostering environmentally friendly and resilient built environments, advocating for continued research and interdisciplinary collaboration to navigate existing challenges and achieve widespread implementation.

AB Lignin is an aromatic biomacromolecule with many promising properties that can be beneficial to polymer blends. The main objective of this work was to investigate the processability, compatibility, and recyclability of lignin blends with poly(lactic acid). Two different commercial kraft lignins and a phenolated organosolv lignin were blended with poly(lactic acid) at various weight percentages, targeting high lignin content (30, 50, and 70 wt %). Obtained blends were used in additive manufacturing via fused deposition modeling. All obtained materials were thoroughly characterized by tensile tests, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and 31P NMR. The recyclability of the polymer blend materials was evaluated by re-extruding them up to four times, and their printability was also assessed. The results showed that the material retained its mechanical properties relatively well for up to three cycles after which its tensile strength decreased by 30%. Phenolated organosolv lignin exhibited better printability across a broader range of lignin content compared to kraft lignin analogs while maintaining similar thermal and mechanical properties.

AB Vacuum membrane distillation can extract pure water from degraded sources, but it requires relatively high energy inputs as compared to other thermal-driven technologies. As a commercially successful example, Memsys Water Technologies GmbH has addressed this key limitation by developing a flat sheet-based vacuum membrane distillation module where the latent heat recycled internally by using multiple distillation effects. In this paper, we propose an alternative hollow fiber-based design which also recycles the latent heat with multiple effects, but with an even more compact membrane packing format. The proposed design uses 3-dimensional printing to 'unlock' this configuration via a hollow aluminium alloy baffle which relies on its low thermal resistance to recover the latent heat effectively. The printed metal baffle (0.8 mm wall thickness) was calculated to have a very high conductive heat transfer coefficient, similar to 180 kW/m(2)K (surpassing even the similar to 20 mu m polypropylene foil used in the Memsys module, which has a conductance of similar to 10 kW/m(2)K). Our experimental and theoretical results indicate that this design uses a condensation-convection-distillation heat and mass transfer mechanism which enables a three-effect system to reduce the energy consumption by similar to 60% over a single-effect design (i.e. from 672 kWh/m(3) to 263 kWh/m(3)) for synthetic geothermal brine (-200 g/L salt concentration). Furthermore, the prototype reached a high average permeate flux of similar to 5.1 LMH and a salt rejection rate of > 99.99%, approaching zero liquid discharge. Overall, this work suggests that hollow fiber membranes can indeed be used in a multi-effect mode and represents a promising new pathway for membrane distillation.

AB Several environmental and techno-economic assessments highlighted the advantage of placing polystyrene-based materials in a circular loop, from production to waste generation to product refabrication, either following the mechanical or thermochemical routes. This review provides an assortment of promising approaches to solving the dilemma of polystyrene waste. With a focus on upcycling technologies available in the last five years, the review first gives an overview of polystyrene, its chemistry, types, forms, and varied applications. This work presents all the stages that involve polystyrene's cycle of life and the properties that make this product, in mixtures with other polymers, command a demand on the market. The features and mechanical performance of the studied materials with their associated images give an idea of the influence of recycling on the structure. Notably, technological assessments of elucidated approaches are also provided. No single approach can be mentioned as effective per se; hybrid technologies appear to possess the highest potential. Finally, this review correlates the amenability of these polystyrene upcycling methodologies to frontier technologies relating to 3D printing, human space habitation, flow chemistry, vertical farming, and green hydrogen, which may be less intuitive to many.

AB The laser-based powder bed fusion of polymers (PBF-LB/P) process often utilizes a blend of powders with varying degrees of degradation. Specifically, for polyamide 12, the traditional reuse schema involves mixing postprocessed powder with virgin powder at a predetermined ratio before reintroducing it to the process. Given that only about 15% of the powder is utilized in part production, and powders are refreshed in equal proportions, there arises a challenge with the incremental accumulation of material across build cycles. To mitigate the consumption of fresh powder relative to the actual material usage, this study introduces the incorporation of recycled material into the PBF-LB/P process. This new powder reuse schema is presented for the first time, focusing on the laser sintering process. The characteristics of the recycled powder were evaluated through scanning electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, particle size distribution, and dynamic powder flowability assessments. The findings reveal that waste powders can be effectively reused in PBF-LB/P to produce components with satisfactory mechanical properties, porosity levels, dimensional accuracy, and surface quality.

AB Screw extruders as continuous flow reactors allow the synthesis of new polymers, preparation of polymer blends and composites, and modification or functionalization of commercially available polymers. Literature data shows that the twin screw extrusion is the most popular solution used for this purpose. In contrast, the number of scientific papers on alternative methods, such as multi -screw extruders, is somewhat limited. This paper is the first review of the application of planetary roller extruders in the compounding and reactive processing of polymer blends and composites. To fill current knowledge gaps, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of planetary roller extruders compared to other screw extruders. Moreover, we summarize recent advances in planetary roller extrusion in producing thermal sensitive and biodegradable polymeric materials, rubber compounds, materials for 3D printing, or plastics and rubber recycling. This work also proposes the possible scenarios for further sustainable development of polymer blends and composites using planetary roller extruders.

AB Container salvaging is becoming common in maritime industry, and we are more interested in recycling containers from the sea. Often, containers are often loaded with either valuable or harmful substances and must be retrieved. Therefore, there is motivation for model tests and numerical calculations on container models falling into water. 3D-printed container models, representing different loading conditions, have been dropped into the towing tank at the University of New Orleans (UNO). Videos of these dropped containers are analyzed to classify the initial angle of the container dropped into water. The containers were dropped 57 times each at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees angles into the tank. Preprocessing tasks are conducted on the videos to prepare for model training. The two-phase angle classification approach uses a pre-trained ResNet50 model, trained on ImageNet, as a feature extractor to produce latent features to train a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model for classifying the entry angle of the dropped object. Initial results have shown it is possible for a model to classify the angles of dropped objects into water with up to 95% accuracy. Furthermore, the data obtained from these small-scale experiments will be integrated into the existing in-house tool "DROBS".

AB Chloride ingress and resulting steel corrosion are the main reasons leading to durability degradation. A body of literature on chloride transport and steel corrosion in recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is currently available, but a systematic review has been lacking. This paper presents a critical review of chloride transport in RAC, and the induced steel corrosion behaviour and cracking patterns of reinforced RAC are introduced. Related modification methods are further discussed. The results showed that the incorporated recycled aggregate (RA) increased chloride ingress in RAC, and a time-dependent characteristic was observed for the chloride diffusion coefficient. The lower RA properties led to higher chloride ingress in preparing RAC when RA substitution rates were the same; the induced environmental damage accelerated chloride ingress in RAC. Incorporating RA increased the steel corrosion risk and shortened the initial corrosion time of reinforced RAC, and the cracking pattern of reinforced RAC was different from the cracking pattern of reinforced natural aggregate concrete. Removing and enhancing the adhered old mortar of RA improve the properties of RAC, and various modification methods can be employed to improve the resistance to chloride ingress and steel corrosion in RAC. In particular, a CO2-curing treatment, which is eco-friendly, is recommended for improving the RA and RAC properties. The study of chloride ingress and steel corrosion in ultra-high performance RAC and 3D-printed RAC should be a focus in further studies. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB We report the electrochemical potential of conductive filaments produced with recycled polylactic acid (rPLA) alongside a mixture of graphite (Gpt) and/or carbon black (CB) and castor oil to create an electrode ready-to-use. Additively-manufactured electrodes (AMEs) were compared with commercial-conductive filament composed of PLA and CB. The Gpt-CB-rPLA and CB-rPLA sensors showed lower charge-transfer resistance (Rct) and a greater heterogenous rate constant, k0, (Rct = 1040 +/- 50 Omega and 1810 +/- 30 Omega and k0 = 6.91 (+/- 0.58) x10-3 and 5.31 (+/- 0.40) x 10-3 cm s-1, respectively) compared to the sensor from the commercial filament (Rct = 9620 +/- 280 Omega and k0 = 3.62 (+/- 0.38) x10-3 cm s-1). The electrochemical response of [Fe(CN6)]3-/4- displayed a peak-to-peak separation of 180 +/- 8 mV (Gpt-CB-rPLA) and 240 +/- 6 mV (CB-rPLA) compared to commercial AME (740 +/- 10 mV), without any surface treatment. The filaments were used to create a 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) detection platform with linear range of 5-20 and 5-100 mu mol L-1 for Gpt-CB-rPLA and CB-rPLA, respectively. The collector-detector device was applied for the analysis of a blast simulation. Finally, it is worth noting that the results obtained are without electrode treatment/activation, indicating that the rough surface of the additively manufactured electrode is an additional feature of the device for collecting explosive residues, simply by rubbing the additively manufactured platform on different surfaces in crime scenarios.

AB This study aims to improve the fresh and hardened properties of 3D-printable mortars. For this purpose, mortar mixtures containing cellulose nanofibres (CNF) obtained from the green algae of the Cladophora sp., which is abundant in lakes and causes environmental pollution if not recycled, as well as commercially available cellulose nanocrystals (CNC) and welan gum (WG) were prepared. The results showed that CNF was the most effective additive in improving fresh-state rheology, increasing yield stress by approximately 6 times and thixotropy by 48 times compared to the reference sample. Additionally, the CNF-modified mortar could carry a load of 50 N in the fresh state. The CNC additive showed the best mechanical performance, increasing compressive strength by 12%. Cellulosic additives were also observed to reduce shrinkage. Nanocellulose additives also increased the interlayer adhesion strength. All additives used have improved the properties of 3D-printable mortars. This study successfully produced a 3D-printable concrete/mortar additive from Cladophora sp., an environmentally detrimental waste material.

AB Ever since the introduction of 3D printing, industries have seen an exponential growth in production and efficiency. Three-dimensional printing is the process of additive manufacturing (AM) in which the conventional method of material removal is challenged. Layer-on-layer deposition is the basic principle of the AM. Additive manufacturing technologies are used to create 3D-printed objects. An object is built in an additive technique by laying down successive layers of material until the object is complete. Each of these layers can be viewed as a cross-section of the item that has been lightly cut. When compared to traditional production methods, 3D printing allows the creation of complicated shapes with less material. In conventional methods, the materials go through several damages due to the tool-workpiece contact creating friction between them and the dissipated heat that damages the material. Overcoming the conventional method of machining with the help of 3D printing is a new advancement in the industries. The process involves using non-conventional methods for the machining of the parts. This research was oriented towards the chemical vapor jet drilling of the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) materials. ABS materials are highly machinable and can be recycled for further usage. This paper focused on the usage of acetone as the chemical for drilling. The surface roughness and circularity of the drilled hole was taken into account for this research paper. We set up a manual experiment to run tests and get results. A vapor jet machine was designed with acetone as the core for the vapor. Various analyses were also formulated and conducted during experimentations. Surface roughness analysis provided the insight of roughness after the machining with the help of acetone vapor jet spray. SEM and micro-image parameters were also considered for more clear and advanced reports. In this research paper, DSC and FTIR analysis were performed to understand changes in the internal structure and the material properties of the ABS. Moreover, the research aimed to investigate the effect of various inputs processing parameters such as pressure, flow rate, and stand-off distance on the surface roughness and circularity of ABS workpiece material. The Taguchi L-9 orthogonal array design was utilized to conduct tests by chemical vapor jet drilling using acetone and to evaluate the performance of the set-up while reducing the influence of interfering factors in order to provide reliable surface finish and circularity results. The results and conclusion of the research paper aimed to determine the most suitable parameters for the non-conventional acetone vapor jet drilling of the ABS material. The theoretical calculations predicted 1.64432 and 0.3289080 values of surface roughness and circularity, respectively. On the other hand, the experimental values were recorded as 1.598 for surface roughness and 0.322 for circularity. Therefore, a negligible error of 0.046 for surface roughness and 0.0031 for circularity, respectively, was noted which validate the statistical equations and the consistency of the combined vapor jet drilling process.

AB This study presents a novel approach to sustainable additive manufacturing by utilizing waste Mucuna pruriens seed powder (MPSP) as a bio-based reinforcement in recycled Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (r-ABS) composites, addressing critical environmental challenges through agricultural waste valorization and circular material utilization. Comprehensive morphological characterization using SEM revealed irregular MPSP particles with fractal dimensions and mean size 1.13 +/- 0.25 mu m, exhibiting trimodal particle size distribution spanning large particles (1.2-1.4 mu m), mid-range (0.9-1.2 mu m), and small particles (0.6-0.9 mu m). EDAX spectroscopy confirmed favorable elemental composition with 51.81 wt% carbon (59.08 atomic%), 45.81 wt% oxygen, and 1.38 wt% nitrogen, indicating suitable reinforcement potential. XRD crystallographic analysis revealed a 28.41% crystallinity index with an average crystallite size of 21 nm, demonstrating comparable structural characteristics to established natural fillers including chestnut shell (23.25%) and almond shell (32.88%). Systematic mechanical property optimization identified optimal performance at 3 wt% MPSP loading, achieving significant enhancements: tensile strength increased by 5% (29.87-31.21 MPa), flexural strength improved by 10.3% (47.81-52.73 MPa), flexural modulus enhanced by 10.3% (2250-2350 MPa), and most notably, impact strength increased by 34.03%, demonstrating exceptional toughness improvement. These comprehensive findings establish MPSP-reinforced r-ABS filaments as promising sustainable materials for high-performance 3D printing applications, effectively transforming dual waste streams into value-added composites with superior mechanical properties suitable for demanding additive manufacturing applications.

AB Catalytic degradation of organic contaminants is at the frontier of water treatment due to its selectivity, energy savings, and ability to convert harmful contaminants into harmless or even valuable chemical products for recycling. However, achieving sufficiently high performance in the catalytic removal of organic contaminants for practical application is still extremely challenging. Herein, we report a Pd-decorated TiO2 (Pd/TiO2) hierarchical vertical array for fast and efficient catalytic water treatment. Such a forestlike Pd/TiO2 vertical array demonstrates the following distinct advantages over conventional planar or bulk catalytic systems: 1) abundant anchoring sites for nanocrystals loading; 2) high sunlight absorption; 3) efficient mass transfer channels for the reactants and products. As a proof of concept, the Pd/TiO2 array demonstrated rapid and efficient photo-assisted catalytic reduction of high concentrations of 4-nitrophenol wastewater (2 g/L, ca. 14.38 mmol/L) and its feasibility for continuous flow wastewater treatment. The turnover frequency (TOF) value of the Pd/TiO2 array was up to 8.00 min(-1), which was approximately 4.2 times that of planar Pd/TiO2 film with the same area (1.91 min(-1)). Our strategy of incorporating nanocatalysts with a hierarchical vertical array provides a promising approach to boosting the catalytic performance of catalysts for different chemical reactions.

AB The increasing amount of marine plastic waste poses challenges including, not only the collection, but also the subsequent recyclability of the plastic. An artificial accelerated weathering procedure was developed, which modelled the marine environment and investigated the recyclability of weathered and non-weathered PET. Marine conditions were simulated for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottle material and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) cap material. It consisted of 2520 h cyclical weathering, alternating the sample between a salt spray and a Xenon-chamber-this corresponds to roughly 3-4 years on the surface of an ocean.
   It was proved that the molecular weight of PET is a function of weathering time and can be described mathematically. Microscopic examination of the surface of the PET bottles and HDPE caps proved that these surfaces were damaged. After weathering, manufacturing tests were performed on the PET material by extrusion, injection moulding, 3D printing and thermoforming. Quantitative comparison between products manufactured by the same technology was performed in order to compare the qualities of products made from original PET, non-weathered PET waste, which was the example of classical recycling, and weathered PET. In the case of products made from weathered PET, certain mechanical and optical properties (e.g. impact strength and transparency) were significantly impaired compared to the original PET and the recycled, non-weathered PET. Certain other properties (e.g. strength and rigidity) did not change significantly. It was proved that the samples from weathered plastic material can be successfully recycled mechanically and used to manufacture plastic products. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Only a small fraction of the global plastic waste is recycled, and the recycled materials are often of lower quality. For example, only 14% of the world's total plastic is recycled, with low-density polyethylene (LDPE) accounting for only 4% of it. This study presents a novel approach to transforming waste LDPE into electrically conductive artificial graphite with high crystallinity using stabilization and graphitization processes. This method achieves a carbon yield of 89.4%, surpassing yields from conventional polymer precursors, such as polyacrylonitrile and polyamide. The resulting LDPE-derived graphite (LGP) exhibits a high crystallinity and electrical conductivity, twice those of natural graphite and comparable to those of artificial graphite, which typically requires extensive heat treatment to prepare. LGP can be used in pastes and inks for advanced applications, such as 3D printing, flexible electrodes, heaters, and photothermal devices. Additionally, the high crystallinity of LGP enables the formation of larger graphene oxide (GO) with an average size of 4.1 +/- 2.4 mu m, because the larger crystalline domains in LGP facilitate the exfoliation process. The approach developed in this study contributes significantly to LDPE waste management and provides a pathway for the fabrication of valuable carbon materials for broad industrial applications.

AB The paper analyzes the current state of plastic value chains in Africa and the potential of digital innovations adopted by African entrepreneurs to contributing to a circular plastic economy. We provide an overview of plastic waste trade to African countries and an assessment of existing digital solutions that can support the transition to a circular plastic economy. The findings show that various digital innovations are being applied by entrepreneurs including web-based solutions, mobile apps and 3D printing. The case studies also show that multinational companies, especially consumer facing brands, are major players in the national plastic value chains in African countries, acting as seed funders for start-ups as well as buyers of recycled plastics. Current initiatives that are underway are positive signs that changes are in progress to address the environmental and social impacts of plastics value chains in Africa. However, to achieve a transition to sustainable circular value chains, changes at policy level will be required to enable scaling-up of local start-up businesses, address regulatory barriers to digital solutions, create markets for recycled plastic materials and implement extended producer responsibility regulations.

AB Fabricating sustainable circuits with low-waste end-of-life is crucial for enabling an electronics circular economy. Here, we present the first circularity-driven fabrication flow for sustainable wireless circuits based on recyclable liquid metals and degradable dielectrics. The proposed recyclable radio frequency (RF) circuits consist of 3D-printed substrates with fluidic channels, e.g. using polylactic acid (PLA), filled with Galinstan interconnects. At their end-of-life, the ICs and liquid metal interconnects are recovered and re-used in functional circuits, over multiple iterations. The printed dielectrics are degraded, with under 2% by weight waste produced. Various RF circuits are demonstrated, up to 4 GHz, including transmission lines based on Coplanar Waveguides (CPWs), with high-performance DC/RF control and filtering, and broadband high-efficiency radiation in a CPW antenna. Active microwave systems are then demonstrated including a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and a multi-layered design for a broadband power amplifier (PA). The circuits maintain a stable performance across over 9 metal and 3 IC re-use cycles. The reliability of the circuits is verified by continuously operating months-old circuits for over 30 hours as well as under-water storage, demonstrating their reliability. Our results pave the way for multi-function, green wireless circuits, reducing waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) and allowing component circularity.

AB Some of the most promising distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) technical systems use fused particle fabrication (FPF) or fused granular fabrication (FGF), where compression screws force post-consumer waste plastic through a heated nozzle for direct 3D printing. To assist the technical evolution of these systems, this study provided the details of an invention for a low-cost, easily replicable open-source grinding machine for compression screw manufacturing. The system itself can be largely fabricated using FPF/FGF following the self-replicating rapid prototyper (RepRap) methodology. This grinding machine can be made from a cordless cut-off grinder and < $155 in parts. The new invention is demonstrated to be able to cut custom screws with variable (i) channel depths, (ii) screw diameters, (iii) screw lengths, (iv) pitches, (v) abrasive disk thicknesses, (vi) handedness of the screws, (vii) and materials (three types of steel tested: 1045 steel, 1144 steel, and 416 stainless steel). The results show that the device is more than capable of replicating commercial screws as well as providing makers with a much greater flexibility to make custom screws. This invention enables the DRAM toolchain to become even more self-sufficient, which assists the goals of the circular economy.

AB As the prevalence of electronics increases and their lifespan decreases, the volume of electronic waste (E-waste) continues to grow. Recycling E-waste poses challenges due to the intricate nature of electronics and their packaging, making it difficult to retrieve components for reuse. While there has been research into sustainable materials for electronics, sustainable integrated circuit (IC) packaging has remained unexplored. This research presents a new method that involves using dissolvable materials made through additive manufacturing for IC packaging, aimed at recovering bare-die chips from used electronics. Two recyclable polymer materials, Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), are employed and fabricated using Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) based 3D printing. Under optimal dissolving conditions, chip recovery takes less than 12 minutes for PVA and 2 minutes for ABS. Performance tests conducted after retrieval show no compromise in functionality in terms of clock frequency and power consumption. This approach presents a sustainable packaging solution for commercial electronic chips that matches the performance of conventional packaging methods.

AB Assembly of materials into microstructures under laser guidance is attracting wide attention. The ability to pattern various materials and form 2D and 3D structures with micron/sub-micron resolution and less energy and material waste compared with standard top-down methods make laser-based printing promising for many applications, for example medical devices, sensors, and microelectronics. Assembly from liquids provides a smaller feature size than powders and has advantages over other states of matter in terms of relatively simple setup, easy handling, and recycling. However, the simplicity of the setup conceals a variety of underlying mechanisms, which cannot be identified simply according to the starting or resulting materials. This progress report surveys the various mechanisms according to the source of the material-preformed or locally synthesized. Within each category, methods are defined according to the driving force of material deposition. The advantages and limitations of each method are critically discussed, and the methods are compared, shedding light on future directions and developments required to advance this field.

AB The education in the University is in a critical point. A better learning planning is necessary, with the aim of having a more effective education. We need a new set of study plans ... etc., based on a complete formation. This implies the use of the new technologies and the adaptation of the previous teaching systems to the evolution of the means. Drawing and building have been necessarily united since construction became so precise.
   In this document we are going to talk about new materials and construction systems, and how we can make parts for the building, which improve the features of existing ones. We are going to study different educational methodologies in which we are working now, compiling the educational experiences developed in the Technical Top School of Building, Technical University of Madrid (UPM), applied to several Educational different Units.
   The main goal is to create a modular piece to be used in any type of vertical walls inside a building. It is using a basic assembly scheme and new technologies offered by 3D printing.
   With these new technologies, we are able to print any piece, at any time, in the construction process.
   With the new design of P.T.M.P pieces, we are able to speed up constructive processes and lower costs. It does not need specialized personnel for its installation, nor for its printing. It is an ecological and sustainable product.
   Depending on the data obtained in the compression resistance tests, we can use P.T.M.P. bricks for the realization of load-bearing walls, thus discarding the execution of structural vertical elements.
   In brief, using the means offered by the new technologies of 3D printing, and recycling a product such as plastic, which is having a great impact in the environment due its long biodegradation time. With the new approach we can create a brick prototype which behaves much better in almost every aspects than the traditional ceramic brick. Thus, it is contributing to improve the environment, the constructive economy and sustainability in the building. We will see the new technologies of 3D printers and their use for the construction of buildings.

The assumptions of the behaviour of individual components and subsystems of the design result from an extensive application of the finite element method and motion analysis of subsystems and various parts of the structure. The use of this method to such an extent accelerated the design process and its implementation. The proposal itself reflects the current state of this technology and its focus is on improving sustainable development. As is generally known, great efforts are currently being made to reduce plastic waste volume and its environmental burden. The proposed concept is modified to replace the final treatment of the top layers of the models, called "ironing" by non-planar layering of material. At the same time, it points out the advantages of this method in reducing energy requirements and the time required to produce models. The conclusion is a conceptual design of a printhead for a proposed prototype, designed to use recycled FDM, intending to streamline the possibility of recycling with little serial and piece production. This process thus closes the circle of opportunities published by us, which in the future can contribute to the optimisation of this technology towards increasing the efficiency of resource use, reduction of energy demands and environmental burden.

AB This study presents an innovative approach based on the combination of two different techniques for fiber-reinforced epoxy composites manufacturing, i.e., additive manufacturing (AM) and hand lay-up-assisted vacuum bagging. It represents a proof of concepts for the manufacturing of a customized and lightweight lower-limb prostheses having built-in functional elements, such as sensors. In particular, a soluble tool for fabricating a complex-shaped carbon reinforced epoxy composite is produced by AM. The 3D printed model is properly designed to integrate a functional element, in a customized way, within the composite structure itself. Moreover, a fully-recyclable epoxy resin system is used as matrix for the fabricated composite part to recover the expensive functional part and carbon fibers as soon as the prostheses has reached the end of its life (EoL). The prostheses recycle is carried out through a chemical recycling process that relies on the presence of acid-cleavable groups within the epoxy-cured network that allows for the cleavage of the crosslink under certain conditions. A similar approach is proposed in the state of art, but by using the traditional autoclave prepreg process and without considering the handling of the part at its EoL.

AB In this paper, we study the effect of the addition of wood flour as a filler in a recycled polyethylene (r-PE) in view of its potential applications in 3D printing. The composites, prepared by melt mixing, are characterized with torque measurements performed during the compounding, dynamic rotational rheology, and infrared spectroscopy. Data show that the introduction of wood results in increased viscosity and in sensible viscous heating during the compounding. The r-PE appear to be stable at temperatures up to 180 degrees C while at higher temperatures the material shows a rheological response characterized by time-increasing viscoelastic moduli that suggests a thermal degradation governed by crosslinking reactions. The compounds (with wood loading up to 50% in wt.) also shows thermal stability at temperatures up to 180 degrees C. The viscoelastic behavior and the infrared spectra of the r-PE matrix suggests the presence of branches in the macromolecular structure due to the process. Although the addition of wood particles determines increased viscoelastic moduli, a solid-like viscoelastic response is not shown even for the highest wood concentrations. This behavior, due to a poor compatibility and weak interfacial adhesion between the two phases, is however promising in view of common processing technologies as extrusion or injection molding.

AB This paper introduces a printable ultra-high-performance fibre-reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) with an average 28-day compressive strength of 230 MPa and a maximum flexural strength of 31 MPa, which was achieved through extensive testing and adjustments guided by the theory of maximum packing density. Three types of printable UHPFRC mixes were assessed with 0 %, 10 %, and 20 % rubber content. The basic properties were tested, including slump flow, rheology, printability, microstructure, compressive strength and flexural strength. By replacing 20 % of the fine aggregate in equal volume with recycled rubber, the UHPFRRuC achieved an average 28-day compressive strength of 137 MPa and a maximum flexural strength of 22 MPa. In addition, this study proves that maintaining a minimum static yield stress of 250 Pa and a plastic viscosity of 20 Pa s is crucial for ensuring good printability. Additionally, the distribution of steel fibres significantly influences the failure mode of UHPFRC specimens under static uniaxial compression, with fibres aligned parallel to the load direction (3DP-X) showing the highest compressive strength and most cracks. In UHPFRRuC, cracks tend to develop along the rubber particles. This study enhances the understanding of printable UHPFRC and UHPFRRuC. This study explores the development of 3D-printable UHPFRRuC, which overcomes the strength limitations of conventional rubberised concrete while retaining its superior impact resistance and damping properties. By integrating 3D printability, high strength, and enhanced energy absorption, UHPFRRuC presents significant potential for applications in resilient infrastructure, such as roadside barriers, earthquake-resistant slabs, and bridge components, warranting further investigation.

AB This study highlights the reuse of the by-products of waste PCB (WPCB) after the metal extraction by pyrometallurgy and bioleaching. In this study the carbonaceous slag obtained was used as a reinforcement to increase the strength of a synthesized nano fibre membrane which could be used for the treatment of wastewater. The synthesized membrane has nano fibres with an average size of 90-110 nm which was produced using an electrospinning machine. The Raman spectroscopy results proved that the carbonaceous slag is rich in carbon and few amounts of graphite was also present in it. The FESEM results proved that the nano fibres were spun perfect which would increase the strength of membrane, thereby increasing the workability towards wastewater treatment. The FTIR results also proved that there is change in the molecular groups of the carbon incorporated fibres. The 3D image of the membrane captured by the Atomic Force Microscope proved that the sample has nano fibre woven on the surface along with the carbon which increases the stability and also as a mere amount of metal is present on the carbon the chance of fouling by the microbes would be limited. Thus, the recycled Fibre Reinforced Polymer (rFRP) is an efficient membrane for the treatment of domestic or industrial wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The polymer foil industry is one of the leading producers of plastic waste. The development of new recycling methods for packaging products is one of the biggest demands in today's engineering. The subject of this research was the melt processing of multilayered PET-based foil waste with PETG copolymer. The resulting blends were intended for additive manufacturing processing using the fused deposition modeling (FDM) method. In order to improve the properties of the developed materials, the blends compounding procedure was conducted with the addition of a reactive chain extender (CE) and elastomeric copolymer used as an impact modifier (IM). The samples were manufactured using the 3D printing technique and, for comparison, using the traditional injection molding method. The obtained samples were subjected to a detailed characterization procedure, including mechanical performance evaluation, thermal analysis, and rheological measurements. This research confirms that PET-based film waste can be successfully used for the production of filament, and for most samples, the FDM printing process can be conducted without any difficulties. Unfortunately, the unmodified blends are characterized by brittleness, which makes it necessary to use an elastomer additive (IM). The presence of a semicrystalline PET phase improves the thermal resistance of the prepared blends; however, an annealing procedure is required for this purpose.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, is increasingly recognised as a disruptive production technology with the capacity to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across manufacturing and transportation sectors. By enabling material efficiency, lightweighting, part consolidation, and decentralised, on-demand production, AM offers pathways to lower embodied energy, minimise waste, and shorten supply chains. This review critically evaluates AM's role in decarbonisation, with a focus on clean transportation applications, including electric vehicles, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage systems. Case studies quantify energy savings, operational efficiency gains, and life-cycle GHG reductions compared to conventional manufacturing routes. The analysis also addresses technical and economic limitations-such as material availability, scalability, certification, and cost competitiveness-and explores synergies with circular economy principles, digital design optimisation, and artificial intelligence. Policy recommendations and industry-academia collaboration models are proposed to accelerate AM adoption, integrate renewable energy sources, and strengthen recycling infrastructure. By synthesising technical, economic, and policy perspectives, the study positions AM as a critical enabler of net-zero manufacturing and a catalyst for sustainable industrial transformation.

AB Bioplastics such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), which are derived from renewable sources, promoted as biodegradable and implemented for numerous functions, offer a promising alternative to the enduring synthetic plastics abundant in society. However, the degradation of PLA is slow under natural environmental conditions. A chemical recycling route is thus required to couple mitigation of plastic persistence repercussions with circular economy adherence. In the present work, the production of ethyl lactate by the catalysed transesterification of post-consumer PLA was investigated. The catalyst employed was a propylendiamine Zn(II) complex. The PLA samples investigated consisted of a phone case, an infant's toy, a film, a cup and 3D printing material. Degradation reactions were studied at 50 degrees C and 90 degrees C and the concentrations measured at two different time intervals, 1 h and 3 h. The results revealed that greater activity of the catalyst was observed at 50 degrees C for two PLA samples (cup, 3D print). PLA film achieved the greatest lactate yield (71%) of all samples after 3 h at 50 degrees C. It is concluded that the propylenediamine Zn(II) catalyst can be used to produce green solvent ethyl lactate at mild temperatures from post-consumer PLA, even in the presence of unknown additives.

AB The rapid development of flexible electronic devices has resulted in serious electronic pollution, which has aroused great attention in recent years. This study focuses on the development of dynamic cross-linking poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) elastomers with covalent adaptive network structures that can be recycled by a solvolytic approach to address this challenge. The elastomer is prepared through the addition reaction between amine-terminated PDMS, isophorone diisocyanate, and 2-aminobenzimidazole followed by cross-linking with hexamethylene diisocyanate trimer. The secondary ureidobenzimidazole (SUBI) moieties formed by benzimidazole and isocyanate groups can undergo a six-membered-ring transition state, enabling automatic dissociation and reformation character at room temperature. Hydrogen-bonded aggregates formed by SUBI moieties work as physical cross-linking units to protect urea bonds from dissociation, which endows the materials with excellent creep-resistant performance. Decomposition of the aggregates by solvation, releasing the SUBI moieties, is mainly responsible for the recycling process. Wearable electronic devices with a microcrack structure for vibratory monitoring are assembled through 3D printing nanosilver paste onto the elastomer with predesigned structure. The excellent recycling performance can be transferred from the PDMS substrate to the devices, which enables the separation of PDMS and nanosilver, providing promising principles to develop facile degradable materials at room temperature for fabricating recyclable wearable electronic devices.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) methods have a growing application in different fields such as aeronautical, automotive, biomedical, and there is a huge interest towards the extension of their use. In this paper, lattice structures for AM are analysed with regards to stiffness and printability in order to verify the suitability for applications where the main requirement of efficiency in terms of stiffness has to be balanced with other needs such as weight saving, ease of manufacturing and recycling of the material. At this aim, lattice structures with high porosity unit cells and large cell size made of a recyclable material were considered with a geometrical configuration allowing 3D printing without any supports. The lattice structures considered were based on body-centred cubic (BCC) and face centred cubic (FCC) unit cell combined with cubic cell. Finally, a multi-morphology lattice structure obtained by mixing different unit cells is also proposed. The lattice structures were modelled and structurally analysed by means of finite element method (FEM), manufactured with a Fusion deposition modelling (FDM) printer and evaluated in relation to printability and dimensional accuracy. The results show that the proposed structure with mixed cells is potentially advantageous in terms of weight saving in relation to the mechanical properties.

AB This work reports the thermal, rheological, and crystallographic structural behavior of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) derived from bottle waste. The intent is to optimize it to an upcoming source for additive manufacturing by modulating its behavior using a chain extender triphenyl phosphite (TPP), nanofiller montmorillonite (MMT K-10), and catalyst antimony trioxide (Sb2O3). FT-IR (Fourier Transform Infrared) analysis showed an increase in absorbance due to the Sb2O3. The thermal analysis of the rPET using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) ascertains a 10 degrees C decrease in T-g with a substantial increase in the degradation onset of 7 degrees C due to MMT content. The melt flow index (MFI) study showed an increase with a similar range in intrinsic viscosity and weight average molecular weight (M-w) due to the additives. The percentage crystallinity, interlayer distance, and average crystallite size are determined and analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and DSC curves. The results are within the comparative range of both tests. The presence of Sb2O3 with higher MMT content showed agglomeration, and increased TPP showed low crystalline properties. These results provide that rPET can be altered to manufacture feedstock to suit different 3D printing techniques for prototyping.

AB Advancements in material science, manufacturing and sensor technologies, Artificial Intelligence, and the Internet of Things have paved the way for fabricating new parts using additive manufacturing in microgravity conditions. NASA has successfully demonstrated 3D printing onboard the International Space Station (ISS), though at a minor scale. Nevertheless, the parts built onboard the ISS were returned to Earth for further testing and verification. The logistics of bi-directional transportation of raw materials from Earth to ISS and 3D-printed parts from ISS back to Earth is complex, expensive, and slow. Harnessing materials from space to establish in-orbit manufacturing as a sustainable process is both technically and economically challenging. The potential to reuse, repurpose or recycle space debris is not well studied, though there is an increasing momentum in Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions. Unlike the standard research or review paper, this is a visionary paper in which the authors explicitly address the intersection between space debris removal and in-space manufacturing. This paper defines a pathway towards implementing an operational in-orbit manufacturing and debris removal model. For the first time, the authors introduce the application of Cloud-Based Design and Manufacturing (CBDM) for in-space manufacturing in this paper. The paper aims to define a roadmap towards implementing a space operational model for in-orbit manufacturing and debris removal. Future enabling technologies that will leverage the advances in robotics, automation, and Space 5.0-based solutions to create a new environmentally friendly and economically profitable orbital ecosystem are presented. The authors analyze the pros and cons of robotic ADR, upcycling and recycling space debris for on-demand manufacturing in orbit and present a systematic approach to implementing in-orbit manufacturing as a new frontier. Recommendations are made to establish an imminent Earth-independent space logistics and supply chain system for operating an orbital factory or warehouse that will help realize a suite of in-orbit manufacturing, maintenance, and assembly missions.

AB The development of bespoke, high-performance conductive filament is critical to address limitations of current additively manufactured sensors. In particular, enhancing the sensitivity and reliability of this technology is vital toward their in-the-field applications such as water pollution monitoring. As such, we present the production of filament containing a mix of carbon black (CB) and graphite (G) functionalised with silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) that does not require special printing conditions, special instrumentation, or any post-print modification for the detection of cadmium (II) in environmental waters. The AgNPs are synthesised on graphite flakes using an ecofriendly, aqueous synthesis, without additional reducing agents and their presence is confirmed through SEM, EDX and XPS analysis. The AgNP loaded graphite is incorporated into a filament using recycled PLA and the biobased plasticiser castor oil, ensuring sustainability is at the heart of the work. The electrodes produced a heterogeneous rate constant, k0, of (1.9 +/- 0.2) x 10- 3 cm s- 1 and were applied toward the detection of cadmium (II) within buffer, tap water, and river water samples. Importantly, using electrodes straight from the print bed with no post-print modification, a Limit of Detection of 0.43 mu g L- 1 and a Limit of Quantification of 1.44 mu g L- 1 towards the sensing of cadmium (II), significantly below the worldwide targets of 3-5 mu g L- 1, was achievedwas achieved. This work shows a simple but effective approach to include metallic nanoparticles within conductive additive manufacturing filament and the capabilities towards monitoring heavy metal contaminants in water systems.

AB Utilizing CO2 as a mild oxidant for oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane (ODHE) is an attractive way of recycling this greenhouse contaminant. Typically, CO2 capture and conversion processes are performed in separate beds, however, combining these processes into one bed incurs advantages of lower thermal gradient and reduced energy costs. This study formulated the first generation of structured dual-functional materials (DFMs) by directly 3D printing metal-oxide-CaO/ZSM-5 inks into monolithic contactors. Specifically, we 3D-printed monoliths with V, Ga, Ni, or Ti dopants to perform metal screening and determine which metal generates the best structured DFM for combined CO2 capture and utilization in ODHE. The samples were vigorously characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), N-2 physisorption, NH3-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), H-2-temperature programmed reduction (H-2-TPR), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), and Pyridine Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (Py-FTIR). Their CO2 capture/ODHE performances were assessed with CO2 adsorption at 600 C and ODHE of 25 mL/min 7% C2H6 at 700 C. The combined adsorption/catalysis experiments indicated that the best performance was observed in V-CaO/ZSM-5 which achieved a staggeringly high CO2 capture (5.4 mmol/g), 65.2% CO2 conversion, 36.5% C2H6 conversion, 98% C2H4 selectivity, and 35.8% C2H4 yield as well as zero thermal cracking after 40 min-on-stream. This performance exceeded that of any previously reported material for combined CO2 capture and ODHE utilization, indicating this novel printing method can generate DFMs with exceptional potential for combined CO2 capture and utilization processes.

AB In biological structures, where logistic, synthesis and recycling processes take place, one finds compartments for these different processes. These are arranged in a specific order so that there is optimal synthesis, transformation, logistics, freedom from interference and flexibility of action. Between the compartments run fast transport systems, microtubules or roads, along which information, molecules etc. are transported. Because production, transport and recycling processes run in every living cell, or numerous macroscopic logistical pathways between cells have been evolved and optimized, various biological functional and design structures can serve as models for industrial production processes. In the context of biointelligent production concepts, input and output of material, energy and information, resource-optimized biological production processes and recycling of materials are interesting aspects with transfer potential. In this paper, numerous examples from nature and approaches to transfer the principles to industrial production processes are presented. Some of them have already proven their effectiveness and efficiency, others have yet to do so. The hypothesis is that further optimization potential can be tapped if principles that have been successfully applied for millions of years are transferred to human processes that have only been developed over decades or centuries.

AB Purpose - Presently in multicolor fused filament-based three-dimensional (3-D) printing, significant amounts of waste material are produced through nozzle priming and purging each time a change from one color to another occurs. G-code generating slicing software typically changes the material on each layer resulting in wipe towers with greater mass than the target object. The purpose of this study is to provide an alternative fabrication approach based on interlayer tool clustering (ITC) for the first time, which reduces the number of tool changes and is compatible with any commercial 3-D printer without the need for hardware modifications. Design/methodology/approach - The authors have developed an open-source PrusaSlicer upgrade, compatible with Slic3r-based software, which uses the described algorithm to generate g-code toolpath and print experimental objects. The theoretical time, material and energy savings are calculated and validated to evaluate the proposed fabrication method qualitatively and quantitatively. Findings - The experimental results show the novel ITC method can significantly increase the efficiency of multimaterial printing, with an average 1.7-fold reduction in material use, and an average 1.4-fold reduction in both time and 3-D printing energy use. In addition, this approach reduces the likelihood of technical failures in the manufacturing of the entire part by reducing the number of tool changes, or material transitions, on average by 2.4 times. Originality/value - The obtained results support distributed recycling and additive manufacturing, which has both environmental and economic benefits and increasing the number of colors in a 3-D print increases manufacturing savings.

AB Paper is constituted of natural fibers and represents a perfect example of structural multifunctional materials. Indeed, its fibrous structure is engineered to fit the different end use properties: both optical and mechanical properties are usually required. These requirements may lead to contradictory needs in terms of structure. The influence of the structure on the physical properties is classically tackled based on standard methods such as the estimation of the porosity. However, this macroscopic property is not sufficient in terms of optimization of the fibrous network. For example, fluid transport has to be controlled either in the bulk of the material or only at its surface in the case of health or printing applications. Consequently, the characterization at the macro-level of the structure has to be complemented with an experimental measurement at the fiber level. The X-ray synchrotron micro-tomography, an imaging technique, is based on X-ray transmission. It allows the structure to be analyzed in 3D. It was carried in a large instrument (ESRF, France). The characterization of samples containing different recycled fibers was carried out. In particular, the influence of the number of cycles of drying-pulping is studied. Both qualitative and quantitative characterizations are obtained.
   The use of recycled fibers may also be included in the elaboration of materials, taking into account the modification of the fibers in terms of morphology and mechanical properties, essentially flexibility. Mechanical properties (tensile and deformation) constitute the main examples of the analysis showing the effect of the recycling of natural fibers: the decrease in mechanical resistance of the fibrous network is explained in terms of the increase of the global porosity, essentially in the bulk of the materials. The profile of porosity in the thickness direction is found to be essential to understand the evolution of physical properties.

AB Silica exhibits properties such that its addition into polymeric materials can result in an enhanced overall quality and improved characteristics and as a result silica has been widely used as a filler material for improving the rheological properties of polymeric materials. The usage of polymers in three-dimensional printing technology has grown exponentially, which has increased the amount of waste produced during this process. Several polymers, such as polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polylactic acid (PLA), and nylon, are applied in this emerging technology. In this study, the effect of the addition of silica as a filler on the mechanical, thermal, and bulk density properties of the composites prepared from the aforementioned polymeric waste was studied. In addition, the morphology of the composite materials was characterized via scanning electron microscopy. The composite samples were prepared with various silica concentrations using a twin extruder followed by hot compression. Generally, the addition of silica increased the tensile strength of the polymers. For instance, the tensile strength of PVA with 5 wt% filler increased by 76 MPa, whereas those of PP and PLA with 10 wt% filler increased by 7.15 and 121.03 MPa, respectively. The crystallinity of the prepared composite samples ranged from 14% to 35%, which is expected in a composite system. Morphological analysis revealed the random dispersion of silica particles and agglomerate formation at high silica concentrations. The bulk density of the samples decreased with increased amount of filler addition. The addition of silica influenced the changes in the characteristics of the polymeric materials. Furthermore, the properties presented in this study can be used to further study the engineering design, transportation, and production processes, promoting the recycling and reuse of such waste in the same technology with the desired properties.

AB Plastics are a wide range of synthetic or semi-synthetic materials, mainly consisting of polymers. The use of plastics has increased to over 300 million metric tonnes in recent years, and by 2050, it is expected to grow to 800 million. Presently, a mere 10% of plastic waste is recycled, with approximately 75% ended up in landfills. Inappropriate disposal of plastic waste into the environment poses a threat to human lives and marine species. Therefore, this review article highlights potential routes for converting plastic/microplastic waste into valuable resources to promote a greener and more sustainable environment. The literature review revealed that plastics/microplastics (P/MP) could be recycled or upcycled into various products or materials via several innovative processes. For example, P/MP are recycled and utilized as anodes in lithium-ion (Li-ion) and sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries. The anode in Na-ion batteries comprising PP carbon powder exhibits a high reversible capacity of similar to 340 mAh/g at 0.01 A/g current state. In contrast, integrating Fe3O4 and PE into a Li-ion battery yielded an excellent capacity of 1123 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g current state. Additionally, recycled Nylon displayed high physical and mechanical properties necessary for excellent application as 3D printing material. Induction heating is considered a revolutionary pyrolysis technique with improved yield, efficiency, and lower energy utilization. Overall, P/MPs are highlighted as abundant resources for the sustainable production of valuable products and materials such as batteries, nanomaterials, graphene, and membranes for future applications.

AB For this special issue, sustainability and safety are discussed through the tropes of both material and work process substitution. As an architecture and industrial design team, we examine the potential of William McDonough's and Michael Braungart's "cradle to cradle" material methodology, and David Pye's "the workmanship of certainty" as relevant to the construction industry. Locating and revisiting the tenets of Gottfried Semper's Stoffwechseltheorie, alongside contemporary critiques, demonstrates that if historically, material and technique substitution led to architectural innovation, the same conditions exist today. To demonstrate a contemporary Stoffwechsel (material substitution) a formwork prototype was constructed at the University of Canberra's Workshop 7, by substituting timber with plastic, and 3D-printing the formwork. This prototype demonstrates a type of "technical nutrient" that is both recyclable as plastic, and reusable as formwork. This reveals the potential of substituting materials and processes not only to achieve material recovery, but rather, aiming for material recycling, reuse, or upcycling, therefore reducing socio-environmental risks in construction.

AB This research focuses on fabricating a nylon honeycomb-structured three-dimensional (3D) filter for grey wastewater treatment using fused filament fabrication (FFF) and evaluating its performance in water treatment. The honeycomb module offered a tortuous pathway for particulate deposition during dead-end and depth filtration. A titanium dioxide (TiO2 ) nanoparticle coating was applied via spin coating to enhance clogging effects and contaminant retention. A custom test setup was developed to analyse clogging behavior and estimate the filter lifespan. In dead-end mode, the coated filter achieved up to 85% removal of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and 80% removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the first cycle, while depth filtration achieved 80% BOD and 75% COD removal. By the fifth cycle, removal efficiencies decreased to 58% BOD and 50% COD in depth filtration, indicating sustained performance over repeated use. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) visualized progressive particulate accumulation; Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) confirmed TiO2 presence; and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) showed increased surface carbon content after filtration. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy confirmed moderate absorbance reduction at peak wavelengths. However, turbidity and total suspended solids (TSS) remained above acceptable limits (e.g., turbidity > 235 NTU; TSS > 410 mg/L), revealing the need for finer pore sizes or multilayer filtration. Clogging Index (CI) reached 0.45 in dead-end and 0.40 in depth filtration by the fifth cycle. The results demonstrate that this 3D-printed nylon-TiO2 module provides moderate contaminant removal with rapid clogging kinetics, offering promise for non-potable reuse and decentralized greywater treatment applications.

AB Thermal pastes, thermally conductive fillers dispersed in liquid matrices, are widely used as thermal interface materials (TIMs). TIMs transfer heat generated from electronics to the surroundings, ensuring optimal operating temperatures. Thus, it is crucial to obtain high thermal conductivity (TC) by forming a continuous heat-conduction pathway through interconnected filler-networks within the TIM. Therefore, for paste-type TIMs with spherical fillers, high TC can only be realized at sufficiently high filler loadings (>60 vol%). However, the pastes bearing such high filler loadings are thick, stiff, and less applicable. To these ends, particle-stabilized emulsions composed of immiscible liquids (silicone oil and glycerol) and spherical alumina are utilized as thermal pastes. Owing to this structure, the resulting form-factor-free thermal paste exhibits higher TC and stability than a simple mixture consisting of alumina and a single-liquid-matrix (either silicone oil or glycerol). Furthermore, the high applicability of the emulsion-type pastes enables syringe extrusion, 3D printing, multiple cycles of reprocessing/molding, and eco-friendly recycling.

ID FABRICATION; SUSTAINABILITY
AB Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing technology is one of the preferred methods to ensure sustainability in fabrication. In addition to providing continuity in sustainability, fabrication, and diversity, it aims to improve people's quality of life, develop the economy, and protect the environment and resources for future generations. In this study, the life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to determine whether a product fabricated by the AM provides tangible benefits compared to traditional fabrication methodologies. LCA is an evaluation method that provides information on resource efficiency and waste generation, where the environmental impacts of a process can be calculated, measured, and reported throughout the entire life cycle, starting from the acquisition of raw materials, processing, fabrication, use, end of life, and disposal, according to ISO 14040/44 standards. This study examines the environmental impacts of the three most preferred filaments and resin materials in the AM for a 3D-printed product from the start, which consists of three stages. These stages are raw material extraction, manufacturing, and recycling. Filament material types are Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polylactic Acid (PLA), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PETG), and Ultraviolet (UV) Resin. The fabrication process was carried out with Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and Stereolithography (SLA) techniques using a 3D printer. Environmental impacts for all identified steps were estimated over the life cycle using the energy consumption model. As a result of the LCA, it was seen that UV Resin was the most environmentally friendly material in the mid-point and end-point indicators. It has been determined that the ABS material also exhibits bad results on many indicators and is the least environmentally friendly. The results support those working with AM in comparing different materials' environmental impacts and choosing an environmentally friendly material.

AB Expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam (thermocol waste) is produced at a rate of several million tons annually and poses serious environmental challenges due to its widespread use and lack of biodegradability. The present research is to design an effective Malachite Green (MG) dye adsorbent, RBT (Recycled polystyrene (RPS)-Benzophenone-3,3 ',4 ',4 '-Tetracarboxylic dianhydride (BPTCDA)) by the chemical modification of RPS with BPTCDA via two-step reactions (namely the Friedel-Crafts followed by amidation reactions). The adsorbent's characteristics were studied using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) techniques. Solution pH, contact duration, initial dye concentration, adsorbent dose, and temperature of the adsorption process were individually optimized. The adsorption is well matched (R-2 > 0.955) with pseudo second-order kinetics, and Freundlich isotherm was identified as most fitting with research findings. Thermodynamic analysis suggests that the adsorption is spontaneous and endothermic. The probable mechanism behind adsorption was predicted between adsorbent and adsorbate through FT-IR analysis. Finally, MG adsorbed RBT, was converted into 3D printing filaments by the extrusion process. When MG leaching of 3D filaments was evaluated, there was no evidence of MG leaching, which could imply that this approach is an environmentally benign way to remove toxic pollutants as well as reduce landfill polymer waste. Based on the adsorption experiment results, RBT is suitable for the adsorption of MG dye from a water-based medium; also the final product was converted into value-added products.

DE FLUORESCENCE; LASER; PAPER
AB Laser-induced fluorescence imaging has been used to study the microstructure of paper surfaces. Pulses from a XeCl-excimer laser, 10 ns in duration at 308 nm, were used for excitation, and fluorescence was collected at 420 nm. The excitation spot diameter was approximately 20 mum, and the sampling interval 0.15 mm. Within an area of 5*5 mm2, 1023 sampling points were recorded to generate 3D fluorescence maps of paper surfaces. Papers containing fluorescence whitening agents (FWAs) gave the highest average fluorescence signals. Coated papers with no FWAs show weaker signals than the base sheet. For some thirty different paper samples, an obvious correlation between the amount of coating and the average intensity of the fluorescence signal was observed. Signal fluctuations around the average intensity values were sensitive to (1) the chemical pulp content in super calantered (SC) paper, (2) the amount of recycled fiber in newsprint, and (3) the amount of coating on the light-weight coated (LWC) paper surface. An effort was made to correlate fluorescence imaging results to predict mottling (diffusion of printing ink after printing) in various paper brands.

AB The tyre industry is at crossroads, grappling with the dual challenges of waste tyre disposal and the environmental impacts of production. In an era where sustainability is paramount, manufacturers are intensifying efforts to minimize raw material consumption, maximize renewable resource utilization, and innovate tyre recycling. This review critically examines these initiatives, revealing a promising shift towards sustainable practices. Key findings include the industry's adoption of bio-based polymers, fabrics, processing aids, and renewable fillers, which offer greener alternatives to traditional materials. Integrating recycled rubber, bio-based oils, and silica from agricultural waste highlights a significant move towards a circular economy. Advanced technologies such as AI, life cycle assessment, triboelectric tyres, and 3D printing are revolutionizing tyre design and production, further reducing environmental footprints. Despite these advancements, significant knowledge gaps remain concerning the long-term performance and sustainability of these materials. Research into self-healing rubber, vitrimers, and advanced recycling techniques underscores the industry's commitment to environmental stewardship. Nevertheless, the full impact of these innovations on environmental lifecycles remains unclear. This review emphasizes the critical need for further research to bridge these gaps, ensuring that the tyre industry can meet future demands sustainably.

AB This study explores the impact of build orientation on the mechanical, surface, and bioactivity properties of additively manufactured PLA and Re-PLA filaments. PLA and Re-PLA were printed in six orientations at three different filling ratios, with a filament diameter of 1.75 mm, layer thickness of 0.2 mm, and a grid filling shape. The materials were characterized through tensile, flexural, surface roughness, SEM analysis, degradation, and bioactivity (antibacterial and biocompatibility) tests. Results show that build orientation significantly affects the mechanical properties of PLA, with ZXY-ZYX binary groups exhibiting higher bending strength than other orientations. Re-PLA was found to break more uniformly than PLA. No bacterial activity was observed against S. aureus or E. coli for both materials. Cell viability decreased across all filling ratios in Re-PLA, with a general reduction in cell viability after four days of culture compared to day one. No degradation was detected in PLA and Re-PLA filaments at 20%, 40%, and 60% filling ratios. This study aids in selecting optimal factors like structure orientation and filling ratio for various applications and emphasizes the use of recycled biopolymers from renewable resources, such as PLA, over petroleum-based biodegradable polymers.

AB Locking-steel-pipe (LSP) piles connect with adjacent joints to form a pile row enclosure structure. Due to the advantages of quick construction, efficiency in installation, and recycle utilization, the connected LSP piles are frequently used as retaining structure in deep excavation. However, systematic studies of the deformation mechanism of the LSP pile retaining structure are rarely reported, and it still lack of experimental evidence to optimize the design. In this study, a braced supported excavation experimental model test in sand was designed and conducted to investigate the deformation characteristics of LSP pile retaining structure. Three dimensional (3D) printing technique was creatively applied to manufacture LSP model piles. The experimental results show that, a ``S" shaped distribution of bending moments is observed along pile shaft when excavation is executed; the deflection of pile shaft develops deep-seated movements toward the excavation side as excavation went deeper, resulting in a ``bowl" ground settlement. With the deflection of LSP piles, a rotating trend was occurred between pairs of locking joint, and the severe open deformation of locking joint arose on excavation side. There was a gradual reduction in earth pressure behind the LSP pile retaining wall with excavation depth. The earth pressure between two struts level had no obvious changing, owing to the supported effect of inner struts.

AB Circular economy and bioeconomy models have increasingly spread the principles of sustainable development through different strategies such as reuse and recycling. Biomass waste and by-products are often considered valuable resources. Digital technologies, i.e., extrusion-based additive manufacturing, may potentially foster their exploitation as new materials, although the current framework has not been clearly defined yet. This work wants to systematically review the publications focused on new materials from biomass waste or by-products for extrusion-based additive manufacturing processes. The current situation was analyzed on 69 selected works from 2016 searched on Scopus and WoS, focusing on the different raw materials, new 3D printable materials, 3D printing processes, and potential applications. Afterward, the emerging trends were highlighted through selected best practices from the design practice and industrial sectors. Despite the significant development of thermoplastic reinforced materials, i.e., PLA-filled composites, a wide range of biomass waste and by-products have been studied, especially for small format low-cost Fused Filament Fabrication. Although the academic field may be less focused on exploiting these new circular materials, the interest in new applications is increasing within the design practice and industrial sectors, fostering new synergies within bioeconomy and circular economy contexts.

ID DELPHI METHOD
AB PurposeThree-dimensional (3D) printing (3DP), which builds objects layer by layer, has gained traction in the construction industry for its potential to reduce time, cost and waste while boosting productivity. The circular economy (CE) model, an alternative to the traditional linear economy, focuses on minimising waste and resource use by promoting disassembly, material reuse and recycling. By incorporating CE strategies, 3DP can manage waste more effectively, enhancing construction sustainability. However, there is a dearth of literature on this convergence. Hence, this study explores the convergence of 3DP with CE to improve sustainability in construction projects.Design/methodology/approachThis study employs a qualitative research approach with a survey strategy, incorporating an extensive literature review to establish a foundation in the research domain. Data collection was conducted using the Delphi technique, which involved three iterative rounds of semi-structured interviews with experts. The empirical data collected from the expert interviews were analysed using manual content analysis.FindingsThe findings reveal 12 positive and 6 negative impacts of 3DP on sustainability, with 10 applicable CE strategies. Further, this study explores how to integrate CE strategies to manage the identified impacts and their level of influence. Key CE strategies such as designing out waste, waste-free production/waste management and BIM-based construction management were identified as highly influential across the sustainability pillars.Originality/valueThis research makes a significant theoretical contribution by being one of the few studies integrating 3DP, CE and sustainability within the construction sector. It examines the key impacts of 3DP on the pillars of sustainability and proposes CE strategies to mitigate those impacts. By addressing this convergence, the study fills a notable gap in the existing body of literature while offering practical insights into minimising construction waste, cost and time, thereby promoting the development of a more sustainable and circular built environment.

AB Recyclable and degradable flexible bio-based plastics integrating high stability and efficient disintegration on demand are suitable for the fabrication of flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs) capable of safe disposal. However, it is challenging to develop a facile and environmentally friendly method to fabricate such bio-based plastic substrates. Herein, recyclable and degradable reversibly cross-linked hydroplastics with high thermal stability and water stability used as the substrates of FPCBs are fabricated through the complexation of methylcellulose (MC) and tannic acid (TA) in pure water, followed by hot-pressing. Because of dynamic nano-confinement phases, the bio-based hydroplastic (denoted as TA-MC) with a breaking strength of 109.6 MPa possesses a high storage modulus of 2.85 GPa at 180 degrees C. Even being immersed in water for 15 days, the hydroplastic still retains a high breaking strength of 40.4 MPa. Owing to the reversibility of hydrogen bonds, the hydroplastic can be recycled for several times. Moreover, FPCBs composed of flexible TA-MC substrates and 3D printed sensing components can be employed for reliable underwater detection. Electronic components can be easily separated from the FPCBs by dissolving TA-MC substrates in medical alcohol and residue polymer matrices, which degrade into non-toxic substances in soil, can be safely discarded without polluting the environment.

AB In this study, styrene-acrylonitrile-glycidyl methacrylate (SAG) series copolymers were specially designed for producing the recycled acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (rABS)/poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT)/SAG blends, which were prepared through the process of continuous melt blending and batch feeding. The effects of viscosity composition, SAG chemical composition, and SAG content on the morphology, and rheological and mechanical properties of the blends have been investigated. As demonstrated by morphological observation, the variety of viscosity composition of the blends affects the size of dispersed PBT droplets. Moreover, high viscosity of rABS matrix seems to facilitate the formation of smaller dispersed phase size of blends. Various SAG chemical compositions have different stabilities on the morphology of the blends, which affects the deformation, fragmentation, and coalescence of dispersed phase droplets. In addition, a finer phase morphology can be achieved when the density distribution of epoxy group is optimal in SAG copolymer. Rheological characterization manifested that the rheological properties of the blends depends strongly on its composition and structure, while the crosslinking degree is associated with the concentration of reactive groups and extent of reaction. Thereby, the rheological behavior of the blends during processing can be controlled by changing the reactive sequence and adding the quantity of epoxy group. The test on mechanical properties verified that a recycled product with excellent performance can be obtained by altering processing methods and the blends formula, which may be further applied to the 3D printing materials required by fused deposition modeling technology.

AB Based on the proposed stochastic model for the formation of rarefied flows, an analysis of the first stage of rotary mixing of polymer secondary and primary components using a three-row blade sprayer at the preliminary stage of the injection molding machine operation has been carried out. The most significant factors influencing the degree of efficiency of indicated rotary mixing have been established. It is shown that for the maxima of the corresponding differential distribution functions of the number of particles of polymer components, the extreme values of the scattering angles approach each other. In particular, the ratio of these angles for primary and secondary polypropylene corresponds to a value of 1.2.

AB Recycling the graphite powder generated during the processing of traditional graphite blocks (GBs) are crucial for reducing resource waste and managing graphite dust pollution. With the emergence of the dual-carbon economy, the recycling of waste graphite powder (WGP) has gained significant attention in academia and industry. However, due to its high degree of graphitization, past recycling efforts have been limited to low value-added industries, leading to resource wastage and pollution. In this paper, WGP is utilized as the primary raw material, with a resin transition layer constructed on its surface using a thermosetting phenolic resin solution (PFS), forming WGP@PFS. This imparts plasticity to the otherwise brittle graphite powder. A combination of micro-hot pressing additive manufacturing and electric field-driven jet deposition 3D printing (EJD) creates a network within the substrate, enhancing the impregnation effect. Without the need for high-temperature graphitization (similar to 3000 degrees C) and relying solely on atmospheric pressure carbonization, the produced graphite blocks (GBS-WJ) exhibit impressive properties, including a bulk density of 1.77 g/cm(3), compressive strength of 60.76 MPa, and thermal conductivity of 50.34 W/(m<middle dot>K). This approach reduces energy consumption and process time, offering a novel method for WGP recycling.

ID STRENGTH; MODEL
AB Concrete 3D printing using the CONPrint3D process is a continuous, formwork-free construction technology that enables the economic erection of concrete components and building structures under construction site conditions. In the present article, an extension of this method to foam concrete is presented. Foam concrete is characterized by a low density and high thermal insulation capacity, while it exhibits sufficient compressive strength for the load-bearing function. Given an adequate monolithic wall thickness of foam concrete, additional thermal insulation in structural engineering may be dispensed with. This not only speeds up the complete production of walls, but also simplifies the recycling after the end of the buildings' service life. The article examines the production process, material design and material testing as well as construction management aspects of the new technology.

AB Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a ubiquitous thermoplastic used in textiles and packaging, is one of the primary contributors to plastic pollution. While PET is also one of the most recycled plastics, it has value as a rich source of chemical building blocks. When PET is depolymerized by amino alcohols ("alkanolamines") such as monoethanolamine (MEA), terephthalamide-diol molecules are produced. In the presence of thionyl chloride (SOCl2), these diols are amenable to transformation to the corresponding dichloride monomers, which can then be polymerized via condensation methods (i.e., Menshutkin reaction) with bisimidazole compounds followed by ion-exchange to yield polyamide (PA)-ionenes with tailored structures. The PA-ionenes produced from these methods are intrinsically self-healing and possess thermal and mechanical properties which make them amenable to 3D printing. This study reports on synthetic methods and structure-property relationships in PA-ionenes that arise from the choice of molecular building blocks.

AB Selective cement activation (SCA) in additive manufacturing of concrete holds promise for sustainability by enabling localized cement hydration through controlled water application and allowing a wider range of possible geometries for structural elements. However, SCA-based concrete elements face limitations in tensile strength, restricting their construction versatility. Moreover, SCA's manufacturing process constraints reinforcement options, necessitating strategic choices to improve mechanical properties while aligning with sustainability principles and the specific process requirements. This study investigates innovative reinforcement strategies to enhance the mechanical performance of SCA-based concrete elements using recycled foam glass as aggregates. We examine reinforcement materials, including sustainable ones such as basalt. The materials assessed include steel bars, stainless steel cables, basalt bars, carbon fiber rovings, and carbon fiber meshes. Steel bars are evaluated for both in-process and post-printing applications, while all other materials are integrated solely during printing. The study reveals that steel bars, mainly when introduced through subsequent grouting, offer an efficient means to significantly enhance the mechanical properties of SCA-based concrete elements. However, alternative materials like basalt and carbon fibers may face challenges in establishing an effective bond with the printed concrete material. In conclusion, this paper underscores the importance of sustainable reinforcement strategies for SCA-based concrete elements, emphasizing the potential of steel bars and encouraging further exploration of eco-friendly alternatives.

AB Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation commonly used for telecommunications, navigation and food processing. More recently microwave technologies have found applications in fibre-reinforced polymer composites, which are increasingly used in aircraft structures. Microwave energy can be applied with low power (up to milliwatts) for non-destructive testing and high power (up to kilowatts) for heating/curing purposes. The state-of-the-art applications at high power include curing, three-dimensional (3D) printing, joining and recycling, whereas low-power microwave techniques can provide quality checks, strain sensing and damage inspection. Low-power microwave testing has the advantage of being non-contact, there is no need for surface transducers or couplants, it is operator friendly and relatively inexpensive; high-power microwave energy can offer volumetric heating, reduced processing time and energy saving with no ionising hazards. In this paper the recent research progress is reviewed, identifying achievements and challenges. First, the critical electromagnetic properties of composites that are closely related to the heating and sensing performance are discussed. Then, representative case studies are presented. Finally, the trends are outlined, including intelligent/automated inspection and solid-state heating.

AB Development of information technologies and computer-aided design created conditions for virtual modeling, exploring in real-studied objects. Among the list of all CAD systems should provide separate subgroups of special software (CAD-CAM-CAE system) aimed at solving specific, object - oriented tasks. Software is most often used for mathematical calculations (systems MatLab, MathCAD), analytic study schematic technical objects (software VisSim) and 2D and 3D systems for design (systems AutoCAD, AutoCAD-Inventor, T-Flex, Catia, Pro-Engineering, SolidWorks ets.) in engineering practice. We can implement many options for creating solid models in all above-mentioned CAD-systems. Users of the system, who long worked in 2D simulation, at the beginning of the design creates an image in three projections, and then transfer the images in 3D modeling environment. Other users implement the reverse way to prepare design documentation. They create a solid-state model of the object in the first stage, and then, using the tools of CAD-systems in automated mode performing projection drawing. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages, but ultimately will create a set of design documentation and photorealistic images projected product.
   The main task for 3D design, in our view, should be seen in a somewhat different perspective. Existing working drawings and ready virtual product does not characterize the process of production, due to the functional design features, the ratio of the volume of recycled material to the volume of the finished product, technological features of the process of formation, the possibility of instrumental support process, and implementation of control operations and so on. Graduate of the technical areas of study from the University must to have new knowledge and skills for 3D solid modeling based on design and technological knowledge about technic features of manufacturing of such details. This approach is important, along with the implementation of 3D printing.
   The training of engineers should separate design and technological approaches to method of forming geometric shapes in creating solid-state 3D model of the object; the creation of new facilities is in constant communication with the limiting factor in the operation of the facility. It is a regular control of the designer. The process of drafting appropriate to using assembly blocks that formed from individual parts.

AB In past decades, several studies have been reported on the fabrication of thermoplastic matrix-based filaments by mechanical blending with a twin-screw extruder (TSE) for 3D printing applications. But hitherto little has been reported on the chemical-assisted mechanical blending of secondary (2 degrees) recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix with reinforcement of wood dust (WD) and bakelite powder (BP) for non-structural engineering applications. This study demonstrates the influence of TSE processing parameters on various properties (mechanical, rheological, and thermal) of composite filaments prepared by reinforcing WD and BP in a 2 degrees recycled ABS matrix with the assistance of a chemical (acetone) as a novel fabrication technique. It was observed that chemical blending of reinforcements in ABS resulted in improved mechanical properties as compared to mechanical blending, however, the heat-carrying capacity of filaments with chemical assisted blending was degraded. The enhanced peak strength (PS) along with percentage break elongation (%BE) of ABS+BP-based composite filament was observed at 10 kg (load), 245 degrees C (temperature) and 70 rpm (speed) with the corresponding values of PS and %BE as (30.93 MPa, 5.43%), respectively. The input parameters (10 kg, 225 degrees C, 70 rpm) displayed optimum PS and %BE (35.72 MPa, 6.87%), respectively, for ABS+WD-based composite filaments.

AB Additive manufacturing represents a state-of-the-art technology that has been extensively disseminated in both the academic and industrial sectors. This technology enables the cost-effective, simple, and automated production of objects with diverse designs. Moreover, within the academic community, additive manufacturing has provided genuine scientific revolutions, particularly in the field of electrochemistry, due to the accessibility of the Fused Filament Fabrication printing methodology, which utilizes thermoplastic filaments for electrochemical platforms. Additive manufacturing has facilitated the production of conductive components for various applications, including electrochemical sensors, batteries, supercapacitors, and electrical circuits. Within recent years, the scientific community has taken an interest in bespoke filaments that are doped with highly conductive particles, which can be optimized and tailored enabling groups to produce a wide range of filaments with uncountable applications. Thus, the present review article explores the distinct methods of bespoke filament manufacturing, emphasizing its significance in the scientific landscape, and investigating the principal materials utilised in its production, such as thermoplastics, plasticizers, and conductive substances, focusing on electrochemistry applications. Furthermore, all reported additive manufacturing methods will be thoroughly discussed, along with their main advantages and disadvantages. Last, future perspectives will be addressed to guide novel advancements and applications of bespoke filaments for use within electrochemistry.

AB Microgels are soft materials with tunable rheological properties, making them useful for applications such as 3D printing, drug delivery, and coatings. However, balancing printability and structural stability remains a key challenge. In this study, to overcome this issue, we investigate nanoparticle aggregation as a reversible physical cross-linking mechanism in silica-Carbopol microgel composites. The surface charge of silica nanoparticles is pH-sensitive, resulting in aggregation at low pH and dispersion at high pH. This aggregation enhances rheological properties by increasing elasticity and yield stress, while dispersion reduces the rheological properties by allowing for easy flow. Using SAXS, NMR, and recovery rheology, we characterize these structural transitions and demonstrate that aggregation kinetics can be accelerated by tuning the nanoparticle size, temperature, and concentrations. This tunable cross-linking mechanism allows precise control over microgel behavior, enabling their use as recyclable direct-ink-writing printing inks. By using pH and temperature control, our approach provides a pathway to create microgel composites with reversible mechanical properties, opening new possibilities for advanced ink formulations and sustainable material applications.

Based on the specific curriculum being taught at the educational center -which focused on Egyptian culture-, several tools were created: stamps made of foam rubber for writing on papyrus, acetate templates for writing on recycled paper using a cutting plotter, and 3D printed stamps for imprinting on clay. These teaching materials were tested in a classroom of 20 students (boys and girls) in the second year of the early childhood education cycle. Through the implementation of various activities, the materials were evaluated in terms of their suitability for early childhood education, usability, and the quality of the results. Finally, although the teachers and future educators were initially unfamiliar with the tools used to create the materials, they found them to be very functional and practical. They believe that these tools could generate multiple motivating proposals suitable for the students' age, based on the results obtained from the validation in the classroom.

AB In this work, we present a sustainable one-pot two-step approach for the depolymerization and repolymerization of post-consumer poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) into high-performance photocurable liquid polyesters suitable for vat photopolymerization (VP) additive manufacturing. By coupling PET waste alcoholysis with biobased diols and polytransesterification with dimethyl itaconate (DMI), novel poly(diyl itaconate-co-terephthalate) copolyesters were synthesized under solvent-free conditions using dibutyltin dilaurate as a catalyst. The resulting polyesters were formulated with reactive diluents and photoinitiators to yield printable resins with up to 22 wt% recycled PET. Mechanical and thermal analysis of 3D printed parts revealed that the incorporation of PET-derived aromatic structures enhanced stiffness, strength, and thermal stability, while the presence of itaconate units enabled high crosslink density and tunable flexibility. The optimal formulation, containing 75 wt% photocurable polyester containing 15.3% recycled PET, achieved a Young's modulus of 1.4 GPa and flexural strength of 54 MPa, representing the highest performance reported to date for itaconic acid-based 3D printable resins. This integrated approach represents a significant green advance by combining solvent-free processing, renewable feedstocks, and post-consumer PET valorisation. The sustainability of the materials was further validated using the Sustainable Formulation Score (SFS), placing the top-performing resins in the top 10% of benchmarked systems.

AB Flexible electronics greatly facilitate human life due to their convenience and comfortable utilization. Liquid metals are an ideal candidate for flexible devices; however, the high surface tension and poor surface wettability restrict their application on diverse substrates. Herein, a printable and recyclable ink composed of poly(vinyl alcohol) and a liquid metal (PVA-LM) was developed to resolve these problems. The materials were designed considering the compatibility between PVA and the liquid metal, and the composite theory was applied to determine the component proportion. The developed composites improved the surface wettability of the liquid metal on diverse substrates, and three-dimensional (3D) printing technology was chosen to maximize the use of this material. Moreover, the PVA-LM ink showed excellent conductivity of about 1.3 x 10(5) S/m after being turned on, which favored the designing of alarm systems and object locators. The flexible sensors produced with this ink have broad application, high sensitivity, and superstable signal generation even after 200 cycles. When acting as strain sensors, the constructed composites had high sensitivity for monitoring the human movements. Furthermore, liquid metals in printed products can be recycled under alkaline conditions. This study opens a new direction for the next generation of environmentally friendly flexible devices.

AB Background: The overwhelming global food loss and waste - 2.3 billion tonnes per year - call for timely deployment of recycling/upcycling technologies with high processing capacity. The huge opportunity lies in the unavoidable fraction of food lost from the production and processing line in commercial and industrial (C&I) sector. Taking the leap into the era of mass customization for the best customer fit, three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology is expected to deeply penetrate the manufacturing industry. It is one of the prospective fields that can be integrated with C&I food waste upcycling to excercise circular economy.
   Scope and approach: The amounts of various significant C&I food wastes are estimated to illustrate their potential for materials recovery as a low-carbon upcycling pathway. We then review the materials development using C&I food waste and/or the recovered components for 3DP approaches - direct ink writing (DIW), fused deposition modeling (FDM), and stereolithography (SLA). Considering FDM materials as a representative, the impacts of food waste incorporation are discussed on the strength performance, thermal properties, and 3D printability. We also discuss possible added values offered by food waste-derived materials, such as antimicrobial activity and scent.
   Key findings and conclusions: Food waste-to-3DP material has been proved successful yet the limited food waste content in the formulae (similar to 10-30% in FDM materials) appears as a bottleneck. Scientific questions are yet to be answered regarding the chemical interactions at interface in a biocomposite matrix as well as shear- and temperature-dependent material flow properties. Bridging those scientific gaps will propel innovative materials engineering and stimulate the niche market of bio-based 3DP materials for broader impact.

AB The present Project developed from an action that took place at the Junior University (U. Junior) at University of Porto, edition 2018. More specifically in a course, as part of a summer Project named "Model your ideas in 3D (Modela as tuas ideias em 3D)". In this course, students from the 9th to the 11th grade, aged between 14 and 17 years old, explored the potentialities of the 3D Software open source Blender. Each course had the duration of a week and was organized by two monitors, who enable the students' deeper and broader understanding of the subjects.
   Furthermore, the course was divided into 3 main phases: "introduction to the program", "consolidation of knowledge" and "project". In the introduction, the students had their first contact with the interface software as well as the inputs behind the 3D modulation. The consolidation phase was organized by several exercises, ranging from the simple creation of a house from two cubes to the creation of a table and a chair. In the last phase, the students consolidated the knowledge received during the week. In this edition there was also the possibility of introducing 3D printing technology, allowing the students to see their digital creations gaining shape.
   In this edition, it was proposed that the theme of the final Project be modified. Thus, the students were challenged to jointly create images that demonstrate the contemporary problem of ocean pollution by plastics due to human action. Throughout the week, the students created various 3D models of bottles, marine life, characters, and coastline houses. At the end of the activity, all the elements were gathered, and a final scene was assembled, which resulted in images that intend to sensitize the viewer to the problem.
   By the end of each course week, and from the obtained results, it was possible to state that the students had gained awareness of the problem of sustainability and the power of images. From this experience, we could ask ourselves: how can we produce ecologically sustainable analog images? From the educational point of view, that allowed an interdisciplinarity and awareness for the emancipation of the student.
   This 3D course will be combined with other past courses such as "Plants and seeds for alternative images: researching biodegradable processes in developing photosensitive film". Therefore, an action-research project was designed in order to cross the printing of 3D devices for the capture of images with aspects of image development from biodegradable processes. The intention is to develop an open source ecological kit to capture analog images. Such kit consists of a vertical garden and a Pinhole photographic device made from recycled plastics. For this, the circularity of the materials is a fundamental point in the whole process. The process must be the most ecological possible, from the construction of the device to the development of latent images through ecological solutions (e.g. Developer made from Mint).
   This kit will be printed with 3D printers, allowing the transformation of three-dimensional computer-developed models into physical objects. Future interdisciplinary courses will be designed, where the applicability of the kit will be tested. The project will have 3 cycles. The first one - "Awareness" -, will take place in January, at Soares School; the second - "Interconnected courses on device production and image development" - will take place in July at U. Junior; the third - "Production of the pedagogical kit for secondary students and reflection" -, will occur between September and December 2019.

AB For osteochondral damage, the pH value change of the damaged site will influence the repair efficacy of the patient. For better understanding the mechanism of the acid-base effect, the construction of in vitro model is undoubtedly a simple and interesting work to evaluate the influence. Here, a novel porous silica-based solid-acid catalyst material was prepared by additive manufacturing technology, exhibiting improved eliminating effects of the residue. SEM, FTIR, and TGA were used to characterize the morphology, structure, and thermal stability of the synthesized 3D material. The reaction between 4-methoxybenzyl alcohol and 3, 4-dihydro-2H-pyran was used as a template reaction to evaluate the eliminating performance of the 3D porous material. Solvents were optimized, and three reaction groups in the presence of 3D SiO2, 3D SiO2-SO3H, and 3D SiO2-NH-SO3H, as well as one without catalyst, were compared. In addition, in consideration of the complicated situation of the physiological environment in vivo, universality of the synthesized 3D SiO2-NH-SO3H catalyst material was studied with different alcohols. The results showed that the sulfonic acid-grafted 3D material had excellent catalytic performance, achieving a yield over 95% in only 20 min. Besides, the catalyst material can be recycled at least 10 times, with yields still higher than 90%. Such a solid catalyst material is expected to have great potential in additive manufacturing because the catalyst material is easy-recyclable, renewable and biocompatible. The 3D material with connective channels may also be utilized as an in vitro model for environment evaluation of osteochondral repair in the future.

AB Due to a lack of long-term experience with burgeoning material extrusion-based additive manufacturing technology, also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF), considerable amounts of expensive material will continue to be wasted until a defect-free 3D-printed component can be finalized. In order to lead this advanced manufacturing technique toward cleaner production and to save costs, this study addresses the ability to remanufacture a wide range of commercially available filaments. Most of them either tend to degrade by chain scission or crosslinking. Only polypropylene (PP)-based filaments appear to be particularly thermally stable and therefore suitable for multiple remanufacturing sequences. As the extrusion step exerts the largest influence on the material in terms of temperature and shear load, this study focused on the morphological, rheological, thermal, processing, tensile, and impact properties of a promising PP composite in the course of multiple consecutive extrusions as well as the impact of additional heat stabilizers. Even after 15 consecutive filament extrusions, the stabilized additively manufactured PP composite revealed an unaltered morphology and therefore the same tensile and impact strength as the initial material. As the viscosity of the material of the 15th extrusion was nearly identical to that of the 1st extrusion sequence, the processability both in terms of extrusion and FFF was outstanding, despite the tremendous amount of shear and thermal stress that was undergone. The present work provides key insights into one possible step toward more sustainable production through FFF.

AB Additive manufacturing (three-dimensional (3D) printing) has promising features for fast prototyping electrochemical systems, from cells to sensors. Conductive filaments containing carbon black and poly(lactic acid) (CB/PLA) for electrode fabrication are commercially available but usually rely on low carbon content, resulting in poor electrochemical properties. Filament fabrication can be done within the laboratory by exploring different materials according to the desired applications. In this work, recycled PLA was used as the thermoplastic base polymer, alongside CB as the conductive filler, and tris (2-ethylhexyl) trimellitate was introduced into the filament matrix as a plasticizer (CB/PLA/TTM) to fabricate additively manufactured electrodes (AMEs). This enhanced the electrochemical properties toward different redox probes and the forensic target atropine. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to characterize the filament and AMEs before and after activation. Additive manufacturing has also been used to develop different cell configurations, which is equally important for good electroanalytical performance. Flow analytical techniques, such as batch-injection analysis (BIA), can be used as an alternative to stationary measurements to enhancing sensitivity and detection limits (LOD) via increasing the mass transport of analytes to the electrochemical platform surface, providing automation and high sample throughput. In this context, we developed a compact (similar to 5 mL capacity) and versatile additively manufactured BIA cell that can either perform static or hydrodynamic analyses by simply placing a lid on the device with a hole for the BIA pipette tip. Moreover, knowing that forensic chemistry necessitates portable analytical tools to help police investigation at the crime scene, the AM-BIA cell and the bespoke AMEs were coupled to a portable electrochemical apparatus for on-site atropine analysis in adulterated beverage samples. Atropine determination was performed by differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and amperometry (BIA-AMP) in the same cell, presenting good repeatability for both methods (6% RSD). As expected, the BIA-AMP method showed higher sensitivity (0.0783 mu A mu M-1) and lower LOD (0.51 mu M) compared to the stationary DPV method (sensitivity: 0.0148 mu A mu mol(-1) L; LOD: 2.60 mu M); they both presented good recovery values, varying from 102 to 109% for two spiked samples of gin and whisky. Thus, the versatility and portability of the developed AM-BIA cell coupled with the bespoke filament CB/PLA/TTM allow for rapid and accurate screening and quantification of atropine in real forensic scenarios.

TI Frontal Polymerization of Dihydrofuran Comonomer Facilitates Thermoset

ID OPENING METATHESIS POLYMERIZATION; POLYMERS; VELOCITY
AB Frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) is a rapid, low-energy manufacturing reaction that is useful for curing thermosetting materials. FROMP of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) results in poly(dicyclopentadiene) (p(DCPD)), a tough thermoset with excellent mechanical performance and chemical stability. Like most thermosets, p(DCPD) cannot be reprocessed and is therefore difficult to recycle. Previous work demonstrated that the incorporation of a small quantity of cleavable units in the strand segments of p(DCPD) networks enables their deconstruction. Here, we report that a commercially available multifunctional comonomer, 2,3-dihydrofuran (DHF), both acts as a potent Grubbs catalyst inhibitor during FROMP and introduces acid cleavable units. The resulting materials retain high performance characteristics, including glass-transition temperatures ranging from 115 to 165 degrees C and ultimate strength ranging from 35 to 40 MPa. The addition of DHF above critical loading levels enables deconstructable thermosets. We further demonstrate freeform three-dimensional (3D) printing of deconstructable thermosets via frontal polymerization.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, has revolutionized the modern manufacturing world by providing comprehensive benefits in terms of mass customization, automation, design optimization, quick prototyping, and reduced lead times among other factors. Given the increased popularity, rapid development, and implementation of AM technologies in numerous engineering applications, new methods to enhance the AM process for improved efficiency and to attain sustainability goals are being considered. One approach to achieve sustainability in AM is by considering greener input materials such as natural fiberreinforced composite filaments (NFRCFs) with lower embodied energy. This review focuses on the latest advancements made in the research and development of advanced NFRCFs for the AM process. In the first section, the rationale of using natural fibers in modern NFRCFs is outlined, followed by a description of the key stages of their fabrication process involving the pre-processing of fibers and the addition of plasticizer to enhance their performance. In the second part of this review, a detailed overview of the typical fibers and matrices used in the development of NFRCFs is provided, and some of the typical challenges encountered when utilizing natural fibers, such as their lack of homogeneity, are highlighted. The fiber-matrix interaction and corresponding properties are further discussed, and means to achieve homogeneous NFRC filament are outlined. Finally, the degradability characteristics and recycling methods for NFRCF are discussed, and further means to optimize their performance for increased usage in AM and related applications are presented. To address and overcome the foregoing limitations posed by present-day NFRCF, further research for breakthrough solutions is still required. Further research and development in this area is a prerequisite to attain sustainability in AM, which will also promote the usage and integration of sustainable AM parts into a wider range of engineering applications in our modern society.

AB A synthetic microbial consortium for consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) is considered a promising approach for the biochemical production owing to the efficient division of labor and anticipated favorable economic performance. The current development of synthetic biology has enabled to convert complex substrates to targeted metabolites; however, it remains challenging to construct a CBP system to meet the requirements of differing abiotic conditions such as oxygen concentration. Herein, a 3D bioprinting of living materials containing product-forming anaerobes from a novel type of dual-stage crosslinked yeast-loaded hydrogel bioink (PVA-GMA/PBA-SA) with the advantages of long-term metabolic activities in 9 continuous batch processes and recycling properties are presented. Compared with the suspension fermentation, the maximum yield and productivity of ethanol were increased by 1.9 and 7.2 times, respectively. Moreover, a bioreactor with custom-designed living materials and a 3D printed device for the CBP system was developed, providing defined spatial niches fitting specific oxygen needs. Moreover, the designed enforced spatial niches were successfully applied in a consortium-based CBP system, which was able to produce 12.5 g L-1 ethanol and 13.8 g L-1 lactate from the microcrystalline cellulose.

AB Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have emerged as versatile platforms for broad applications spanning from flexible and wearable integrated circuits to biomedical monitoring to neuromorphic computing. A variety of materials and tailored micro/nanostructures have recently been developed to realized stretchable OECTs, however, a solid-state OECT with high elasticity has not been demonstrated to date. Herein, we present a general platform developed for the facile generation of highly elastic all-polymer OECTs with high transconductance (up to 12.7 mS), long-term mechanical and environmental durability, and sustainability. Rapid prototyping of these devices was achieved simply by transfer printing lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide doped poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene): poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS/LiTFSI) microstructures onto a resilient gelatin-based gel electrolyte, in which both depletion-mode and enhancement-mode OECTs were produced using various active channels. Remarkably, the elaborate 3D architectures of the PEDOT:PSS were engineered, and an imprinted 3D-microstructured channel/electrolyte interface combined with wrinkled electrodes provided performance that was retained (> 70%) through biaxial stretching of 100% strain and after 1000 repeated cycles of 80% strain. Furthermore, the anti-drying and degradable gelatin and the self-crosslinked PEDOT:PSS/LiTFSI jointly enabled stability during > 4 months of storage and on-demand disposal and recycling. This work thus represents a straightforward approach towards high-performance stretchable organic electronics for wearable/implantable/neuromorphic/sustainable applications.

AB PurposePolymer laser powder bed fusion (PBF-LB/P) is an additive manufacturing technology that is sustainable due to the possibility of recycling the powder multiple times and allowing the fabrication of gears without the aid of support structures and subsequent assembly. However, there are constraints in the process that negatively affect its adoption compared to other additive technologies such as material extrusion to produce gears. This study aims to demonstrate that it is possible to overcome the problems due to the physics of the process to produce accurate mechanism.Design/methodology/approachTechnological aspects such as orientation, wheel-shaft thicknesses and degree of powder recycling were examined. Furthermore, the evolving tooth profile was considered as a design parameter to provide a manufacturability map of gear-based mechanisms.FindingsResults show that there are some differences in the functioning of the gear depending on the type of powder used, 100% virgin or 50% virgin and 50% recycled for five cycles. The application of a groove on a gear produced with 100% virgin powder allows the mechanism to be easily unlocked regardless of the orientation and wheel-shaft thicknesses. The application of a specific evolutionary profile independent of the diameter of the reference circle on vertically oriented gears guarantees rotation continuity while preserving the functionality of the assembled mechanism.Originality/valueIn the literature, there are various studies on material aging and reuse in the PBF-LB/P process, mainly focused on the powder deterioration mechanism, powder fluidity, microstructure and mechanical properties of the parts and process parameters. This study, instead, was focused on the functioning of gears, which represent one of the applications in which this technology can have great success, by analyzing the two main effects that can compromise it: recycled powder and vertical orientation during construction.

AB Short-fibre thermoplastic composites offer a balance between cost, processability, and performance, as well as providing a use for recycled fibres making them attractive in various industrial applications. However, the fibres tend to be misaligned due to their low aspect ratio, which can impact mechanical performance. This work examines the as-manufactured microstructure of a chopped carbon fibre-reinforced nylon composite made by material extrusion additive manufacturing in terms of fibre misalignment, void content, shape and distribution before going onto determine its effect on damage evolution under tensile straining by in-situ time-lapse synchrotron computed tomography (CT). To this end, CT scans have been acquired at various stages throughout straining. A high degree of fibre alignment is observed with approximate to 86% within 14 degrees of the extrusion axis, giving a Krenchel orientation factor of 0.75. The time-lapse CT image sequence reveals that because the mean fibre length ( approximate to 98 mu m.) is below the critical fibre length, fibre fracture does not take place during plastic straining. Instead, failure occurs during straining, from pre-existing voids and newly nucleated ones mainly located at fibre ends, their growth and coalescence. The experimental elastic modulus and strength are compared against the Cox-Krenchel and Kelly-Tyson analytical models that take into account fibre misalignment and length, which demonstrate that the fibre orientation is sufficient and future improvements in properties could be achieved by reducing the initial void content (approximate to 2.3%) and increasing the length and volume fraction of the reinforcing fibres.

AB The world population is growing at unprecedented rates and it is expected to reach 9.8 billion in 2050. Today, non-sustainable exploitation of non-renewable resources of the Earth due to the high demand of conventional building materials is already an important environmental issue, and for sure, this concern will become of vital importance in the future with rapidly growing world population. Utilization of alternative building materials in construction is a good way to effectively address this concern. Alternative building materials (ABMs) are low-cost building materials that aim to reduce or eliminate the environmental impact of the construction, simply by saving energy and resources, minimizing the emissions through the use of rapidly renewablematerials, local resources, recycled content, industrial/agricultural byproducts/wastes, etc. This chapter aims to present prevailingABMs for sustainable construction, such as bamboo, rammed earth, strawbale, supplementary cementitious materials, cork, mycelium, HempCrete, Ferrock, Papercrete, etc. Current strategies for ABMs are discussed with emphasis on sustainability concerns. Benefits of these materials and ten remarkable case studies benefiting from the use of ABMs such as 3D Printed Gaia House, Jill Strawbale House, The Higo, Hy-Fi Tower, The Acre, The EcoARK, etc. are also discussed.

AB Astronauts in the Apollo Moon landings were provided a prefabricated habitation structure for the short duration on the lunar surface. While the Apollo Lunar Module was designed to house astronauts for only 75 h, a Martian habitat will require a much greater lifespan. For humans to thrive on Mars for any extended period, semi-permanent structures will have to be erected. Such a large and robust habitat would be impractical to transport prefabricated; thus, utilization of local geo-environmental resources is desired. This study presents recent research performed at Northwestern University towards the formulation and characterization of a Martian infrastructure material, called Marscrete. Marscrete is composed, in its simplest version, by sulfur and Martian regolith with a 50-50 mass ratio. Sulfur is plentiful in compounds on and below the surface of Mars, and regolith is a ubiquitous material. Marscrete is the Martian version of traditional sulfur concrete, which is manufactured by melting sulfur and mixing it with sand with approximately a 25-75 mass ratio. Results on compression strength tests, splitting tensile strength, and fracture tests show that Marscrete has significantly better mechanical properties than traditional sulfur concrete and even standard Portland cement concrete. While a generically suitable construction material, Marscrete, when modified with mission-recycled polyethylene fibers, also demonstrates high capabilities for 3D-printing applications-a likely automated construction technique of Martian structures. This paper will discuss the rheological behavior of fresh printable Marscrete, structural performance of the hardened composite, and pose an apparatus to produce 3D-printed Marscrete.

AB This paper presents a concise state-of-the-art review on the use of Fiber Reinforced Polymers (FRPs) in bridge engineering. The paper is organized into commonly used FRP bridge components, and different materials/manufacturing techniques used for repairing and construction of FRP bridges. Efforts have been made to give a clear and concise view of FRP bridges using the most relevant literature. FRPs have certain desired properties like high strength to weight ratio, and high corrosion and fatigue resistance that make them a sustainable solution for bridges. However, as FRPs are brittle and susceptible to damage, when safety is concerned, critical parts of the bridges are made as hybrids of FRP and conventional materials. Despite significant studies, it has been found that a comprehensive effort is still required on better understanding the long term performance and end-of-life recycling, developing cost-effective and flexible manufacturing processes such as 3D printing, and developing green composites to take full advantages of FRPs.

AB The paper compares and optimizes through modeling conductive polymer composite slabs having different architectures of corrugated surfaces, designed to minimize both the reflectivity and its sensitivity to the angle of incidence of a microwave/millimeter wave signal impinging on the corrugated surface of the slab. Simulations using CST Studio software consider Poly-Lactid-Acid as dielectric material since it is widely used for 3D printing and offers very good possibilities of recycling in the frame of sustainability and green processing. Various profiles of corrugation are investigated; triangular, sinusoidal, or square-dot profiles, and compared with a uniform profile. Parameters such as height, width, and periodicity of the corrugations are varied in order to optimize the performances in terms of reflectivity over a large range of frequencies, between 20 GHz and 100 GHz. The configuration considered is the reflective screen, when the corrugated lossy dielectric slab covers a metallic plate mimicking the target. The goal is to maintain the reflectivity below 10 dB, in order to ensure up to 95% of absorption, for incidence angles up to 60 degrees. Guidelines for the design and optimization of corrugated dielectric slab absorbers are proposed using specific gauges (Rozanov formalism and figure of merit) for the assessment of performances. Particular attention is devoted to the feasibility of manufacturing corrugated structures using additive 3D printing techniques.

AB Despite offering robust mechanical properties, polymer networks suffer from a lack of recyclability, reshaping, and healability. Designing stiff and remendable polymer networks that can repair under mild conditions remains a challenge to extend their field of applications. Herein, we describe a simple approach to design a nonisocyanate-based polyurethane network featuring multiresponsiveness (to humidity and temperature) and outstanding healing properties, as obtained by combining iminoboronate and boroxine chemistry. In spite of the presence of abundant dynamic bonds, the network has a high stiffness (Young's modulus of 551 MPa) and tensile strength (11 MPa). C=N iminoboronate and B-O boroxine exchange reactions at high temperature enable efficient network recycling over multiple cycles without compromising its properties. Owing to these features, 3D objects could be designed and printed. The present approach provides excellent sustainable and high-performance substitution to conventional polyurethane networks requiring the use of toxic isocyanates.

AB The combination of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) and carbon black (CB) is presented to produce a high-performance electrically conductive recycled additive manufacturing filament. The filament and subsequent additively manufactured electrodes were characterised by TGA, XPS, Raman, and SEM and showed excellent low-temperature flexibility. The MWCNT/CB filament exhibited an improved electrochemical performance compared to an identical in-house produced bespoke filament using only CB. A heterogeneous electrochemical rate constant, k(obs)(0) of 1.71 (+/- 0.19) x 10(-3) cm s(-1) was obtained, showing an almost six times improvement over the commonly used commercial conductive CB/PLA. The filament was successfully tested for the simultaneous determination of acetaminophen and phenylephrine, producing linear ranges of 5-60 and 5-200 mu M, sensitivities of 0.05 mu A mu M-1 and 0.14 mu A mu M-1, and limits of detection of 0.04 mu M and 0.38 mu M, respectively. A print-at-home device is presented where a removable lid comprised of rPLA can be placed onto a drinking vessel and the working, counter, and reference components made from our bespoke MWCNT/CB filament. The print-at-home device was successfully used to determine both compounds within real pharmaceutical products, with recoveries between 87 and 120% over a range of three real samples. This work paves the way for fabricating new highly conductive filaments using a combination of carbon materials with different morphologies and physicochemical properties and their application to produce additively manufactured electrodes with greatly improved electrochemical performance.

AB The International Moth Class is a high-performance foiling dinghy. The Moth needs a system to control the angle of attack of the daggerboard flap and maintain ride height to ensure stability throughout the entire speed range. In this work, we initially employed the Design for Additive Manufacturing (DfAM) methodology as the primary approach to minimize material consumption while preserving stiffness and consolidating different components to reduce compliance in the bowsprit assembly. A weight reduction of 32% was realized along with a 44% reduction in front cross-section area to improve the aerodynamics of the component. Furthermore, the components were fabricated through laser powder bed fusion (L-PBF), using recycled titanium grade 5 powder to improve the sustainability of the design.

AB The exponential growth in demand for housing has resulted in a greater focus on rapid construction methods that adhere to circular economy principles. 3D concrete printing is becoming a powerful tool to find solutions to the common challenges of affordable housing for more people, rapid construction, and the digitalization of the construction industry. However, a coherent synthesis of green and digital initiatives has not yet been achieved. For 3D printable materials, recycling of materials that have reached the end of their service life should also be enabled and supported, in line with circular economy goals that prioritize waste reduction and maximization of resource efficiency. With these objectives in mind, the current study focuses on the development of a one-part 3D printable alkali-activated mortar (3DPM) derived from brick masonry waste (BMW). BMWs were used as the main precursor and filler phase, whereas materials such as ground granulated blast furnace slag, kaolin clay, and limestone have been utilized to enhance/ control the mechanical and rheological properties. To investigate the evolution of alkaliactivation and the effect of anisotropy, the macromechanical properties of the developed 3DPM were investigated by compressive strength, flexural strength, split tensile, and direct tensile tests. The micromechanical properties were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), thermogravimetry (TG), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX), and computed tomography (MicroCT) tests. Overall, the results revealed the presence of anisotropy, which can be reduced by optimizing the layer height. Through this optimization, reductions in pore content and distribution, validated by MicroCT, indicated that the disadvantage of the weak interlayer bond zone in stress transfer could be diminished. Micromechanical analysis showed that the gel formation responsible for the strength was the calcium-based gel structures. Considering these findings, it is believed that the BMWbased 3DPM can be an important alternative for the digitalization of the construction industry and its transition to a circular economy.

AB In recent years the increase of our waste is increasing at a very accelerated scale where the main contributor is the Covid-19 because the demand for plastic and masks is constant, creating a negative impact on the environment and ecosystem, because much of the world's population does not provide adequate treatment to their waste. The objective of the research is to determine the amount of surgical masks, plastic bottles and corn starch needed for the production of filaments for 3D printers, which is in great demand in the additive sector because it allows the production of objects of different shapes, sizes, rigidity and even colors. For this reason, 16 treatments were designed factorially with variation of quantities and temperatures, which was applied in the filament production process. After the analysis, the results showed that treatment 11 and 15 are the best option for the production of ecological filaments because they present a better texture and uniform diameter when processed, being a more efficient option for the reduction of waste produced by Covid-19 and more economical if it is complemented with organic materials that can be converted into polymers.

AB The current scenario where the effects of global warming are more and more evident, has motivated different initiatives for facing this, such as the creation of global policies with a clear environmental guideline. Within these policies, the control of Greenhouse Gase (GHG) emissions has been defined as mandatory, but for carrying out this, a smart strategy is proposed. This is the application of a circular economy model, which seeks to minimize the generation of waste and maximize the efficient use of resources. From this point of view, CO2 recycling is an alternative to reduce emissions to the atmosphere, and we need to look for new business models which valorization this compound which now must be considered as a renewable carbon source. This has renewed the interest in known processes for the chemical transformation of CO2 but that have not been applied at industrial level because they do not offer evident profitability. For example, the methane produced in the Sabatier reaction has a great potential for application, but this depends on the existence of a sustainable supply of hydrogen and a greater efficiency during the process that allows maximizing energy efficiency and thermal control to maximize the methane yield. Regarding energy efficiency and thermal control of the process, the use of structured reactors is an appropriate strategy. The evolution of new technologies, such as 3D printing, and the consolidation of knowledge in the structing of catalysts has enabled the use of these reactors to develop a wide range of possibilities in the field. In this sense, the present review presents a brief description of the main policies that have motivated the transition to a circular economy model and within this, to CO2 recycling. This allows understanding, why efforts are being focused on the development of different reactions for CO2 valorization. Special attention to the case of the Sabatier reaction and in the application of structured reactors for such process is paid.

AB This study investigated the effects of multiple laser sintering (LS) cycles on a polyamide 12 powder mixture of 70% recycled material and 30% virgin polymer. This research aimed to understand how repeated LS processing influences this specific powder mixture's thermal and structural properties, which is crucial for optimising its performance in additive manufacturing applications. A thermal analysis revealed significant changes in the thermal behaviour of the powder over successive build cycles. Specifically, there was an observed increase in both the melting temperature and the crystallinity of the powder, alongside a notable decrease in the crystallisation temperature. These alterations suggest that the repeated LS cycles affect the thermal profiles and potentially enhance the material's stability and usability in additive manufacturing processes. Additionally, a particle size distribution analysis indicated statistically significant differences between the initial and post-sintering states of the powder. These differences are significant as they can influence factors such as flowability and packing density, which are critical for the efficiency of additive manufacturing applications. Microscopic observations further revealed a strong correlation between the crystal morphologies and particle shapes, indicating that the structural changes occurring during processing are inter-related. The relationship underscores the importance of understanding microstructural evolution and the mechanical properties of the final printed products. These findings provide crucial insights into the microstructural evolution and thermal behaviour of recycled PA12 powder during multiple LS processing cycles. This study aids in developing practical strategies for sustainable and efficient powder recycling within the realm of additive manufacturing. By examining the intricate dynamics at play, the research opens avenues for enhancing the performance and environmental sustainability of 3D printing technologies, making them more accessible for various industrial applications.

AB This paper describes the use of silk protein, including fibroin and sericin, from an alkaline solution of Ca(OH)(2) for the clean degumming of silk, which is neutralized by sulfuric acid to create calcium salt precipitation. The whole sericin (WS) can not only be recycled, but completely degummed silk fibroin (SF) is also obtained in this process. The inner layers of sericin (ILS) were also prepared from the degummed silk in boiling water by 120 degrees C water treatment. When the three silk proteins (SPs) were individually grafted with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), three grafted silk proteins (G-SF, G-WS, G-ILS) were obtained. After adding I2959 (a photoinitiator), the SP bioinks were prepared with phosphate buffer (PBS) and subsequently bioprinted into various SP scaffolds with a 3D network structure. The compressive strength of the SF/ILS (20%) scaffold added to G-ILS was 45% higher than that of the SF scaffold alone. The thermal decomposition temperatures of the SF/WS (10%) and SF/ILS (20%) scaffolds, mainly composed of a beta-sheet structures, were 3 degrees C and 2 degrees C higher than that of the SF scaffold alone, respectively. The swelling properties and resistance to protease hydrolysis of the SP scaffolds containing sericin were improved. The bovine insulin release rates reached 61% and 56% after 5 days. The L929 cells adhered, stretched, and proliferated well on the SP composite scaffold. Thus, the SP bioinks obtained could be used to print different types of SP composite scaffolds adapted to a variety of applications, including cells, drugs, tissues, etc. The techniques described here provide potential new applications for the recycling and utilization of sericin, which is a waste product of silk processing.

AB Achieving long persistent luminescence (LPL) in fully organic materials with both hour-level duration and high thermal stability remains a fundamental challenge attributable to rapid exciton quenching and poor resistance to thermal disturbances. Herein, a trap engineering strategy is reported based on rigidified triphenylamine derivatives and boronic ester functionalization embedded in recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), enabling the first fully organic polymer-based LPL system that exhibits simultaneously ultralong LPL and exceptional thermal robustness. Molecular conformation locking and optimized donor-acceptor charge transfer lead to deep trap states (approximate to 1.03 eV), resulting in ambient LPL lifetimes exceeding 12 h. Remarkably, the luminescence is thermally enhanced by over 56 times at 500 K, rivaling high-performance inorganic phosphors. In addition, 980 nm near-infrared photo excitation further amplifies the emission, showcasing strong photo-stimulated luminescence capability. Taking advantage of PET's processability, 3D-printed luminescent structures are fabricated that retain LPL functionality and enable spatially resolved thermal sensing and real-time damage detection. This work not only introduces a sustainable and scalable platform for advanced thermal imaging and optoelectronics, but also sets a new benchmark in the design of heat-resistant organic LPL materials, bridging the gap between high-performance functionality and environmental compatibility.

AB The design of responsive materials by introducing dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs), which can undergo reversible association and dissociation under certain conditions, is an appealing research field in recent years. Reversible isocyanate chemistry representatively consists of urethane, thiourethane, and urea bonds, all of which can reverse into their own starting chemicals (isocyanates and active hydrogen compounds) upon heating. In this article, we overview the mechanisms and experimental elements affecting the dynamic features of isocyanate-based bonds (IBs). With the knowledge of reversible isocyanate chemistry, the construction strategies of different dynamic covalent polymers including polyurethanes, polyureas, and polythiourethanes are discussed, in particular for dynamic polymer networks. The major applications of dynamic isocyanate-based polymers in recycling and self-healing materials, shape morphing polymers, 3D printing, and composites are outlined. The emergence of reversible isocyanate chemistry offers a highly effective platform to engineer thermally adaptable materials.

AB In this paper, the author describes how he challenges his senior level undergraduate design students to integrate the use of biomaterials in their projects. One of the biomaterials suggested is the root structure of mushrooms named mycelium, a material that grows and can be shaped in different forms inside a mould. The other material is PLA (Polylactic Acid) a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable sources such as corn starch, that can be used to print 3D objects. The assigned project was to design a lamp that is both innovative and sustainable i.e. minimal impact on the environment, from its birth to its end of life. Other objectives were to explore innovative technologies (3D printing, 3D scanning, leds, sensors). Students were free to define the type of lamp that they wished to design (table lamp, floor lamp, wall lamp, suspension) according to their specific needs and/or interests. The prototype had to be fully functional and ready for "market"/small production; this means they had to plan a coherent sustainable strategy for packaging and transport.
   Another challenge involved the development of a communication strategy to inform the user about the sustainable dimensions behind the concept (for repair, disassembly, re-use, recycling, use of biodegradable elements), through a document, web site or video. Based on the principles of Jonathan Chapman's Emotionally Durable Design, Ed Van Hinte's Eternally Yours: Visions on Product Design, and Don Norman's Emotional Design: Why we Love (or Hate) Everyday Things, the objective was to focus on sustainable design and address the complexity of the task. Through this paper, the author will present the innovative solutions that were developed in this studio and the importance of introducing those new materials in design education.

AB Concrete cracks easily in the tensile zone, which is why the steel reinforcing is used in these areas. Small fractures may still form, allowing liquids and gases to enter the reinforcement and cause it to corrode. Self-healing concrete fixes and closes these tiny fissures, preventing the corrosion from forming. In this study, the potential use of fused deposition modelling (FDM) to create new varieties of vascular networks and tubes from polylactic acid (PLA) has been explored. PLA was printed in three dimensions (3D) that were compared to those of both one-and two-dimensional networks (1D and 2D). The outside diameter was (5.6 mm), and the internal diameter was (4 mm). A volume of 10 ml was used in the whole vascular structures (1D, 2D, and 3D) carrying the healing agents as inorganic sodium silicate liquid and nano-powder (fly ash) made from recycled materials using a planetary ball mill, and subsequently, the prepared tubes were embedded into a concrete beam to introduce self-healing properties. The water-cement ratio (W/C) for all concrete mixtures was (0.6%), and the proportions of concrete mixture were (1:2.16:2.98). The actual self-healing effect was measured regarding the recovery of load-carrying capacity after reloading the repaired specimen by four -point bending, the restored strength was 84% for the specimen with 3D. This also improved durability, compressive strength, and other physical features. The produced pipes may thus be utilized to create innovative concrete that can complete the self-healing and be suited for self-healing bridge applications.

AB The need for sustainable development has never been more urgent, as the world continues to struggle with environmental challenges, such as climate change, pollution, and dwindling natural resources. The use of renewable and recycled waste materials as a source of raw materials for biomaterials and tissue engineering is a promising avenue for sustainable development. Although tissue engineering has rapidly developed, the challenges associated with fulfilling the increasing demand for bone substitutes and implants remain unresolved, particularly as the global population ages. This review provides an overview of waste materials, such as eggshells, seashells, fish residues, and agricultural biomass, that can be transformed into biomaterials for bone tissue engineering. While the development of recycled metals is in its early stages, the use of probiotics and renewable polymers to improve the biofunctionalities of bone implants is highlighted. Despite the advances of additive manufacturing (AM), studies on AM waste-derived bone-substitutes are limited. It is foreseeable that AM technologies can provide a more sustainable alternative to manufacturing biomaterials and implants. The preliminary results of eggshell and seashell-derived calcium phosphate and rice husk ash-derived silica can likely pave the way for more advanced applications of AM waste-derived biomaterials for sustainably addressing several unmet clinical applications.

AB A new powder production method has been developed to speed up the search for novel alloys for additive manufacturing. The technique involves an ultrasonically agitated cold crucible installed at the top of a 20 kHz ultrasonic sonotrode. The material is melted with an electric arc and undergoes pulverization with standing wave vibrations. Several different alloys in various forms, including noble and metallic glass alloys, were chosen to test the process. The atomized particles showed exceptional sphericity, while powder output suitable for additive manufacturing reached up to 60%. The AMZ4 metallic glass powder remained amorphous below the 50 mu m fraction, while tungsten addition led to crystallization in each fraction. Minor contamination and high Mn and Zn evaporation, especially in the finest particles, was observed in atomized powders. The innovative ultrasonic atomization method appears as a promising tool for material scientists to develop powders with tailored chemical composition, size and structure.

AB Biocomposites are sustainable alternatives to conventional composites due to their biodegradability and renewability. This study investigates the mechanical properties of 3D-printed flax fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) composites with fiber weight fractions ranging from 0% to 5%, and examines the effects of a 2% (w/v) sodium hydroxide solution treatment on the composite properties. Adding untreated fiber reduces the mechanical properties of single filaments, while the addition of treated fiber improves tensile strength by 16% and tensile modulus by 14% with up to 5 wt.% flax fiber content in the biocomposite. The treated fibers significantly increase the stiffness of the 3D-printed samples, with an 81% rise in Young's modulus. Compared to pure PLA samples, a 41% improvement is observed with 2.5 wt.% content of treated flax fiber. However, tensile strength decreases by 35% across all samples, with greater reductions following treatment. Compression tests show a 23% strength increase for samples with untreated fibers, but performance declines with chemical treatment. Microscopic images reveal voids that impact mechanical properties, while Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirms the effects of fiber surface modification. These findings highlight the trade-offs between improving stiffness and reducing strength when pre-treatment of flax fibers are used, and underscore the potential of flax fiber-reinforced PLA biocomposites in sustainable additive manufacturing for environmentally-benign a advanced material production.

AB Biobased and biocompatible polymers, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), are of great interest for a large range of applications in the spirit of green chemistry and upcoming reuse and recycling strategies. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB), as a promising biocompatible polymer belonging to PHAs, is subject to increased research concern regarding the high degree of crystallinity and brittle behavior of the resulting materials. Therefore, the improvement of PHB's physico-mechanical properties aims to decrease the Young's modulus values and to increase the ductility of samples. Here, we proposed an ambitious approach to develop melt-processed materials, while combining PHB characteristics with the ductile properties of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL). In order to compatibilize the poorly miscible PHB/PCL blends, dicumyl peroxide (DCP) was used as a free-radical promotor of polyester interchain reactions via the reaction extrusion process. The resulting PHB/PCL-DCP materials revealed a slight increase in the elongation at break, and significant improvement in the impact resistance (7.2 kJ.m(-2)) as compared to PHB. Additional decrease in the Young's modulus values was achieved by incorporating low molecular polyethylene glycol (PEG) as a plasticizer, leading to an important improvement in the impact resistance (15 kJ.m(-2)). Successful 3D printing using fused deposition melting (FDM) of the resulting PHB/PCL-based blends for the design of a prosthetic finger demonstrated the great potential of the proposed approach for the development of next-generation biomaterials.

AB The widespread use of natural aggregates is one of the main causes of the depletion of natural resources, as aggregates are constituents of several construction materials. Alternatively, it is, today, proven to be feasible to use mining tailings, either natural or recycled materials, to produce artificial aggregates through specific processes. A possible way to produce artificial aggregate is through the alkali activation of the powdered material in a process called geopolymerization. This study proposes to use a basalt powder and two different metakaolins as precursors for the production of an alkali-activated artificial aggregate, with a specific shape and size achieved by using 3D-printed molds. The experimental aggregates were evaluated using traditional tests for natural aggregates, such as resistance to compression, specific density and resistance to abrasion and fragmentation. Furthermore, the material was chemically analyzed in order to evaluate the geopolymerization process promoted by the two adopted metakaolins. The physical tests showed that artificial aggregates do not perform well in terms of resistance to wear and fragmentation, which can be improved. However, they revealed promising results in terms of skid, polishing and micro-texture.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the critical need for scalable, rapid, and cost-effective diagnostic solutions, especially in resource-limited settings. In this study, we developed a sustainable magnetic electrochemical biosensor for the mass testing of SARS-CoV-2, emphasizing affordability, environmental impact reduction, and clinical applicability. By leveraging recycled materials from spent batteries and plastics, we achieved a circular economy-based fabrication process with a recyclability rate of 98.5%. The biosensor employs MnFe2O4 nanoparticles functionalized with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, integrated into a 3D-printed electrochemical device for decentralized testing. Advanced characterization confirmed the biosensor's robust performance, including high sensitivity (LOD: 3.46 pg mL-1) and specificity, with results demonstrating a 95% correlation to RT-PCR gold standard testing. The cost of materials used per biosensor test is only USD 0.2, making it highly affordable and suitable for large-scale production using additive manufacturing. Key features include simple preparation, rapid response, and reusability, making it ideal for point-of-care diagnostics. Beyond COVID-19, this platform's modularity allows for adaptation to other viral diseases, offering a versatile solution to global diagnostic challenges. This work highlights the potential of integrating electrochemical sensing with sustainable practices to address healthcare inequities and reduce environmental impact.

AB Lecce Stone is an attractive and appreciated natural material, as well as a non-renewable resource. For thousands of years people have extracted it from the Salento quarries for use as an ornamental, celebrative or building material. The production chain of this stone, from extraction through to the finished product, results in a great deal of scraps produced in both solid and muddy form. In recent decades a new attitude toward stone scraps has gradually taken hold, namely an eco-design approach. Already adopted by some companies, it consists of reusing industrial scraps to produce innovative manufacturing products. Nowadays, in fact, only a small percentage of Lecce Stone (LS) scraps is recycled and used as raw material in other fields, while a significant portion is taken to the landfill, as in the case of the scraps produced in laboratories by Apulian artisans.
   The aim of this paper is to design a novel composite biomaterial, based on Polylactic acid (PLA) and Lecce Stone (LS) scraps and verify its suitability for use by designers to produce original industrial and building products, thereby obtaining environmental advantages through this new practice, based on the Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) technique.

AB This paper presents the experimental results of a 1:1 scale prototype of a segmented pedestrian bridge produced by the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technology Selective Paste Intrusion (SPI). SPI employs a technique where aggregates are selectively bound layer-by-layer in a particle bed with cement paste, enabling the 3D printing of large-scale, free-formed geometries with high shape accuracy and resolution while maintaining material properties comparable to conventionally cast unreinforced concrete. Traditional reinforced concrete structures, like bridges, often face challenges during their end-of-life phase, including limited potential for recoverability, reconstruction difficulties, or, if recycled, time-consuming material separation processes. This paper presents a novel methodology for the fabrication-aware design and additive manufacturing of a bridge structure using unreinforced concrete elements within a post-tensioned system to address these challenges. Leveraging SPI's geometric versatility, mechanical properties, and material separability, a system of prefabricated, dry-assembled, and post-tensioned concrete elements is proposed, resulting in a bridge structure that is fully demountable, reusable, or recyclable at the end of its life cycle. While briefly outlining the fabrication-aware digital design workflow, this paper focuses on the material testing, the manufacturing process, and the experimental results of the assembly and disassembly workflow of the bridge structure. By presenting the potentials, challenges, and limitations of the proposed methods, this research aims to contribute to the understanding of SPI's applicability for automated building construction, offering insights into potential refinements and directions for future exploration.

AB Over the past decades, plastics' growing interest and manufacturing have jeopardized numerous lives and pristine environments due to their accumulation and persistent contamination of degraded small plastic particles called microplastics (MPs). Hence, plastic recycling, composting, incineration, and sanitary landfill offer an answer to the troubling issue, yet every one of them has immense impediments and stays uncontrolled, and they lack environmental sustainability. Therefore, biodegradable plastics (BPs) from renewable raw materials address the best chance toward accomplishing sustainable development goals started universally by the United Nations (UN) in 2015. Ongoing advances in improving bioplastics have advocated their utilization in industrial applications. BPs have been effectively applied in certain businesses in which bioplastics are being created for food packaging as the best-selling product, fertilizer bags, 3D printing polymers, fishnets, medical implants, etc. Hence, studies on BPs should be reinforced, and the item advancement on BPs should be advanced and explored in the future. Further interventions in bioplastics will assist with building up the green economy globally. A brief introduction on BPs, along with the emerging and advanced technologies in biodegradable plastic research, future direction, challenges, and their role in sustainable development, has been explicitly reviewed in this chapter.

A comprehensive investigation is performed to evaluate the compatible and non-compatible recycled polypropylene (PP)/polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) blends combined with functional (electrical, piezoelectric,and dielectric) materials for in-situ fibril production. The nanocompositefibrils made from recycled PP, PET and GNPs/BaTiO3 with high-aspect ratio disparity (400:1) are produced, which exhibit significantly enhanced electrical, thermomechanical, and electromagnetic characteristics. Single-screw extrusion is utilised to fabricate the fibrils with the in-situ fibril morphology of PET and GNPs/BaTiO3 leading to improved electrical conductivity. It is demonstrated that such fibril morphology restricts the chain mobility of polymer molecules, and ultimately increases viscosity and strain energy. Moreover, the study demonstrates a positive reinforcement effect from the utilisation of PET fibrils and GNPs/BaTiO3 in a PP matrix, dominated by the high-aspect ratio, stiffness, and thermal stability of GNPs/BaTiO3. Furthermore, it is observed that the mechanical properties and tension-bearing capacity of the PP are significantly improved by such incorporation. The study also demonstrates that the protection of the remanufactured nanocomposites against electromagnetic interference is significantly improved with the increasing GNPs/BaTiO3 content and the morphological transition from spherical to fibril-shaped PET.
   Fibril nanocomposites made of recycled thermoplastic polymers blend and functional materials are designed, extruded, and comprehensively characterized. This study examines the properties of the nanocomposites made of polypropylene, polyethylene terephthalate, and GNPs/BaTiO3, via quantifying the effects from mixture content and morphology on electrical, thermomechanical and electromagnetic properties of the remanufactured multifunctional materials, contributing to sustainable and high-value fused deposition modelling based 3D-printing industry.image

AB PET-RAFT polymerization (Photoinduced Electron Transfer-Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer Polymerization) has been widely concerned and applied in the field of polymerization due to its characteristics such as low energy consumption, mild reaction conditions, time-space control, reaction orthogonality and oxygen resistance. In terms of surface modification, PET-RAFT polymerization is used to improve the surface characteristics of materials, such as biocompatibility and anti-adhesion. In the biomedical field, PET-RAFT polymerization technology is used to prepare drug delivery systems such as spherical micelles and vesicles. In addition, the application of PET-RAFT polymerization in 3D printing and laser writing demonstrates its great potential for precise control of material structure and functionalization. The key to PET-RAFT polymerization is to find suitable photocatalysts. Currently, the types of catalysts include homogeneous catalyst systems, such as transition metal complexes, porphyrin and phthalocyanine catalysts, organic dyes, and semiconductor materials, as well as heterogeneous catalyst systems, such as macro material supported, nano material supported, metal organic framework, covalent organic framework, conjugated microporous polymers, etc. Among them, heterogeneous catalysts can be effectively recovered and utilized by centrifugation and filtration separation of photocatalysts. The heterogeneous catalyst can be effectively recycled by centrifugation and filtration separation. In the future, researchers will develop new low cost, high efficiency, easy recovery, non-toxic photocatalysts to improve the use of low energy photons and improve the compatibility of photopolymerization with the environment.

AB Relatively little is known about stained glass windows in England predating c. 1170; however, art-historical evaluation by Caviness (1987) argued that four figures from the "Ancestors series" of Canterbury Cathedral, usually dated to the late 12th and early 13th century, in fact date earlier (c. 1130-1160). This would place them amongst the earliest stained glass in England, and the world. Building on our previous work, we address Caviness's hypothesis using a methodology based upon analysis of a few, well-measured heavy trace elements and a 3D-printed attachment for a pXRF spectrometer that facilitates in situ analysis. The results confirm two major periods of "recycling" or re-using medieval glass. The first is consistent with Caviness's argument that figures predating the 1174 fire were reused in the early 13th century. The results suggest that in addition to figures, ornamental borders were reused, indicating the presence of more early glass than previously thought. In the second period of recycling (1790s), surviving figures from the Ancestors series were removed and adapted into rectangular panels for insertion into large Perpendicular-style windows elsewhere in the cathedral. The results show that the glasses used to adapt the panels to a rectangular shape were broadly contemporary with the glasses used to glaze the original Ancestors windows, again representing a more extensive presence of medieval glass in the windows.

SO PROGRESS IN ADDITIVE MANUFACTURING

   Prototyping; Additive-manufacturing materials
AB Large-scale extrusion additive manufacturing (LSEAM) enables production of sizeable polymer components; however, correctly assessing the capabilities of the materials used careful selection of the printing parameters is needed (Tagscherer et al. in Appl Sci, 2022), (Duty et al. in Rapid Prototyp J 23:181-189, 2017), (Quelho de Macedo et al. in Addit Manuf, 2024). This work presents a quality-driven optimization approach to rapidly determine suitable print settings for initial mechanical assessment of a material's capabilities. A recycled polyamide 12 composite reinforced with 35% glass fibers was used as test feedstock material. Salient aspects of printed part quality were identified and quantified through a weighted scoring system prioritizing characteristics relevant for automotive prototyping applications like dimensional accuracy and proper layer positioning and adhesion. Preliminary definitive screening experiments revealed layer width and height as the two most critical process parameters influencing quality scores. Then, these factors were optimized for a 4 mm nozzle diameter using a central composite design (Duty et al. in Rapid Prototyp J 23:181-189, 2017) guided by the quality evaluations on test geometry. The optimal parameters and those from the highest-scoring experimental run were used to produce tensile specimens in 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees orientations relative to the printed layers. Tensile testing captured the expected anisotropic performance, with the 0 degrees aligned orientation exhibiting highest strength but lower ductility due to fiber alignment along the print direction. Conversely, off-axis orientations showed greater elongation from interlayer deformation but reduced strength. While model predictions identified promising regions, the best experimental parameters provided superior overall mechanical properties, avoiding quality degradation possibly from phenomena such as material accumulation on the surface of the nozzle unaccounted for in modeling. For the 4 mm nozzle, large-scale printed tensile strengths approached injection molded values, while higher elongations at break were observed. This quality-driven methodology effectively optimized LSEAM parameters to characterize key performance capabilities of a new feedstock material, enabling efficient initial screening before more exhaustive qualification efforts.

ID EXTRUSION
AB The material extrusion (MEX) method is a prominent additive manufacturing (AM) technology employed across numerous industrial sectors. However, its applications have been limited by weak interlayer bonding and low strength of thermoplastics. This study investigates the potential of recycle Carbon Fiber(rCF) to enhance the mechanical properties of polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG)-based composites, with the aim of enhancing mechanical performance and reducing waste. PETG/rCF composite filaments were fabricated with different rCF contents (0 %, 5 %, 10 %, and 15 %), and 3D printed specimens were prepared. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), tensile test, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis were performed to characterize the PETG/rCF composites. The tensile test results showed that the addition of 5 wt% rCF increased the tensile strength by 70.21 %. Fracture surface analysis using SEM showed that the addition of rCF 5 wt% improved the mechanical properties through stronger bonding with the PETG matrix. However, the addition of rCF 15 wt% caused an increase in voids and brittle fracture, resulting in a decrease in mechanical strength.

AB A massive carbon footprint is associated with the ubiquitous use of plastics and their afterlife. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from plastics are rising and increasingly consuming the global "carbon budget". It is, hence, paramount to implement an effective strategy to reclaim postconsumer plastic as feedstock for technologically innovative materials. Credible opportunity is offered by advances in materials chemistry and catalysis. Here, we demonstrate that by dynamically crosslinking thermoplastic polyolefins, commodity plastics can be upcycled into technically superior and economically competitive materials. A broadly applicable crosslinking strategy has been applied to polymers containing solely carbon-carbon and carbon-hydrogen bonds, initially by maleic anhydride functionalization, followed by epoxy-anhydride curing. These dynamic networks show a distinct rubber modulus above the melting transition. We demonstrate that sustainability and performance do not have to be mutually exclusive. The dynamic network can be extruded into a continuous filament to be in three-dimensional (3D) printing of complex objects, which retain the mechanical integrity of vitrimers. Being covalently crosslinked, these networks show a thermally triggered shape-memory response, with 90% recovery of a programmed shape. This study opens up the possibility of reclaiming recycled thermoplastics by imparting performance, sustainability, and technological advances to the reprocessed plastic.

AB In response to the urgent need for sustainable, eco-friendly materials for manufacturing, this study introduces a zero-VOC, recyclable poly(urea-urethane) acrylate (PUUA) photocurable resin featuring dynamic hindered urea bonds (HUBs). The innovative molecular design integrates 2-(tert-butylamino)ethyl methacrylate (TBEA) and N, N '-di-tert-butylethylenediamine (BEDA) to enable complete liquefaction at 100 C-degrees within 3 h, allowing for multiple recycling and reprocessing cycles under mild conditions, free of catalysts and solvents. This dynamic covalent network achieves high thermal stability, optical clarity, and exceptional mechanical properties (tensile strength >40 MPa, compressive strength >200 MPa), maintaining performance even after two recycling cycles. Using a high-resolution LCD 3D printer, complex prototypes-including functional components-were fabricated with excellent dimensional accuracy and minimal light scattering. The resin exhibits low viscosity, high transmittance (>80 %), and a curing depth exceeding 55 mu m, critical for efficient printing. By offering a green, scalable solution for producing recyclable, high-performance photocurable resins, this work paves the way for sustainable materials technologies and circular manufacturing practices, addressing both environmental impact and industrial scalability.

AB Mechanical meta-material structures (MMS) are designed structures with mechanical properties not found in ordinary materials. MMS can now be created far more easily using digital manufacturing. We explore how different MMS can be combined, through the design of a shoe sole. Thereby showing the potential of using MMS to create personalized and sustainable footwear. We analysed the phenomenon of foot deformation and mapped different structures with different behaviours to meet the needs of different feet. Consequently, a shoe sole was generated by an algorithm and 3D printed in one single material with multiple properties (e.g. stiff and soft) and responsive behaviour, making it easy to recycle. We report the design phases which required using six types of software. Our findings reflect the complexity of this process given the limited availability of software tools that support it. We conclude with a list of requirements regarding tools to further explore MMS.

AB Polylactic acid (processed by fused filament fabrication) and 17-4 precipitate-hardened stainless steel (processed by direct metal laser sintering) have wide scaffolding applications. However, little has been reported on recycling biocompatible polylactic acid-based waste and 17-4 precipitate-hardened stainless steel-based waste powder (collected from the direct metal laser sintering setup) for scaffolding applications such as splints. This study highlights the development of polylactic acid-17-4 precipitate hardened stainless steel matrix-based composite to fabricate splints/external fixators. The mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties of polylactic acid-17-4 precipitate-hardened stainless steel filament composites were investigated using varying heat treatment types, extrusion speed, and temperature. The best setting for maximising the peak strain and break strain was predicted with the combination of post-heat treatment, 7 rpm screw speed, and 210 degrees C extrusion temperature. Further, the morphological, thermal, and bond characteristics (based on differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transmission infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis) also support the study. The proposed composite prepared by the extrusion has shown acceptable properties as splints/external fixators.

AB In this paper, a spherical helix module based on 3D printing and microfluidic technologies was fabricated, tested and applied to drug delivery applications. A liquid metal alloy is introduced to enhance the sensitivity of the complex and drug/liquid-reconfigurable helix topology. Moreover, the influence of the dimensions of the hemisphere inscribed by the helical turns on the resonant frequency of the structure is researched. The microfluidic channels with 1 mm radius are shaped in the form of double semispherical helix using a Form-2 3D printer. To fulfill effectively the liquid metal (LM) injection, movement and recycle for reuse, a syringe pump is integrated to flexibly control the flow of the fluid. Besides, the proof-of-concept prototype achieves excellent radiation gain and impedance matching. The realized sensitivity is 0.96 mL/GHz and 0.33 mL/GHz corresponding with the frequency shift from 2.28 to 2.01 GHz and 2.01 to 1.65 GHz.

AB The environmental friendliness of 3D printable mixes is most likely achievable through recycling industrial waste. The effect of partially replacing ordinary Portland cement (OPC) with different ratios (0 %, 20 %, 40 %, and 60 % by weight of OPC) of fly ash (FA) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (BFS) on various properties of 3D printable concretes has been studied. The water-tobinder ratio and aggregate volume percentage were 0.3 and 41 %, respectively. A standard flowtable test was conducted to adjust superplasticizer dosages for the target flow diameter in the presence of a constant viscosity modifying agent content in all mixtures. A manual injection gun was used to simulate the printing process and monitor the buildability of the mixes. A rotational rheometer was employed to measure the rheological properties. Furthermore, ram extrusion and green strength tests were conducted to quantify the time-dependent properties at early ages. Flexural and compressive strengths were assessed at 7 and 28 days of standard curing. Finally, the embodied carbon (EC) and energy (EE) were evaluated. The findings of this study highlight that at an equal flow diameter, BFS and FA inclusion significantly influence extrusion forces, open time, and green strength of printable mixtures in contrasting ways. BFS improved the green strength, buildability, and static yield stress, increasing the green strength by up to 163.41 %; however, it may reduce the open time proportionally with its content. In contrast, FA replacement can extend the open time by lowering the development of extrusion force. However, FA reduced the green strength, with a decline of up to 35.4 %. Both pozzolans increased the 28-day flexural and compressive strength, but this effect was not observed in the 60 % fly ash-bearing mixture. Overall, BFS outperforms FA in enhancing buildability and structural performance, particularly at an early age. Incorporating BFS and FA significantly reduced carbon emissions and embodied energy, with reductions of up to 40 % and 41 % for BFS and 62 % and 57 % for FA, respectively.

AB This work studies a novel sustainable polymeric material made from a reactive blend of two agri-food waste plastics, with the new material showing strong promise for value-added industrial uses. Discarded bale wrap destined for landfill that was originally made from linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and used polyethylene terephthalate (PET)-based plastic bottles were melt mixed in a twin-screw extruder. The miscibility of such recycled LLDPE (rLLDPE) in recycled PET (rPET) is enhanced by the incorporation of a compatibilizer and the PET molecular architecture is maintained using a chain extender, which governs its melt strength. Microscopic analysis of the blends with the compatibilizer and chain extender confirms the enhanced interaction of rPET and rLLDPE chains and the formation of co-continuous morphologies. The efficient interaction of a soft phase (rLLDPE) with a hard phase (rPET) leads to prolonged fracture propagation by an appropriate impact energy transfer mechanism, which ultimately enhances the impact resistance and elongation at break of the resulting blend. The incorporation of a compatibilizer and chain extender in the rPET/rLLDPE blend makes it a toughened blend (with 60 J m(-1) notched Izod impact strength) with similar to 80% elongation at break in comparison to similar to 3% for the blend without a compatibilizer or chain extender. Around similar to 36% enhancement is observed in the tensile strength without affecting the tensile and flexural modulus in comparison to the blend without a compatibilizer or chain extender. Applications of the developed materials can extend from rigid packaging applications to the production of filaments for 3D printing.

AB By the late 1970s, plastics had emerged as the most widely used materials globally. The discovery, development, and processing of diverse polymeric materials have profoundly shaped modern life and driven the expansion of numerous industries. Given the widespread interest in the utilization of these materials, it has become increasingly imperative to design their life cycles from the outset. This approach aims to maximize their utility while minimizing their environmental footprint. This review aims to identify and analyze the key challenges in polymer processing applicable to both additive and formative manufacturing methods, emphasizing the relationship between processing and recycling within the framework of sustainability. Modern polymer processing techniques play a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability of polymer products by improving recycling potential (with consideration of polymer type, source, and additives), cost-effectiveness, carbon footprint, and key properties such as durability, lifespan, performance, and environmental impact. It will also explore the concept of the circular economy and its integration into modern processing methods, including extrusion, injection molding, and 3D printing. Additionally, current polymer recycling methods are analyzed with respect to their effectiveness, sustainability, and compatibility with the original materials. Moreover, the discussion emphasizes the benefits of a circular economy compared to a linear one by exploring the concepts of closed-loop and open-loop systems, along with their diverse applications depending on the material and the initial processing method employed. To ensure that humanity continues to benefit from polymer materials while striving for a waste-free environment, it is essential to integrate the principles of sustainable development from the very beginning.

AB Electronic waste (e-waste) and diabetes are global challenges to modern societies. However, solving these two challenges together has been challenging until now. Herein, we propose a laser-induced transfer method to fabricate portable glucose sensors by recycling copper from e-waste. We bring up a laser-induced full-automatic fabrication method for synthesizing continuous heterogeneous CuxO (h-CuxO) nano-skeletons electrode for glucose sensing, offering rapid (< 1 min), clean, air-compatible, and continuous fabrication, applicable to a wide range of Cu-containing substrates. Leveraging this approach, h-CuxO nano-skeletons, with an inner core predominantly composed of Cu2O with lower oxygen content, juxtaposed with an outer layer rich in amorphous CuxO (a-CuxO) with higher oxygen content, are derived from discarded printed circuit boards. When employed in glucose detection, the h-CuxO nano-skeletons undergo a structural evolution process, transitioning into rigid Cu2O@CuO nano-skeletons prompted by electrochemical activation. This transformation yields exceptional glucose-sensing performance (sensitivity: 9.893 mA mM(-1) cm(-2); detection limit: 0.34 mu M), outperforming most previously reported glucose sensors. Density functional theory analysis elucidates that the heterogeneous structure facilitates gluconolactone desorption. This glucose detection device has also been downsized to optimize its scalability and portability for convenient integration into people's everyday lives.

AB This paper examines the emissions tradeoffs of additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing) using plastic waste in fused granular fabrication (FGF) versus traditional fused filament fabrication (FFF) and injection molding (IM). A 'cradle-to-gate' life cycle assessment (LCA) was utilized to compare these methods, built in OpenLCA v1.11.0 with the Ecoinvent v3.9.1 database. Different scenarios were used to evaluate the impacts of varying transportation and material inputs, highlighting critical emission contributors in manufacturing plastic goods. FGF with waste plastic can significantly reduce climate impact by 82.1% relative to FFF and 70.6% relative to IM for a specified unit product. Even with varied transportation and materials, FGF is a lower CO2-equivalent emitting method. Utilizing FGF with waste plastic as a manufacturing method could reduce emissions and divert plastic from landfills and the environment, thereby contributing to a circular plastic economy.

AB A facile hydrothermal-aided process is demonstrated to prepare an analcime 3-dimensional (3D) network using recycled aluminum foil as an aluminum source without using an organic template. The prepared material was characterized by different techniques. An electrode/electrolyte interface with a 3D network structure allows for better contact and improves the kinetics of the charge transfer. The synthesized materials have been evaluated as a possible electrocatalyst to the electroanalytical sensing of the precise determination and screening of ertapenem (ERTA) in the presence of antiviral agent's favipiravir (FAV), linezolid (LIN), and paracetamol in serum using a green synthetic process involving 3D zeolitic analcime modified screen-printed sensors. Our sensor demonstrated high stability and repeatability. Peak currents estimated by square wave voltammetry varied linearly with ERTA concentrations in the ranges of 5.0 x 10-8 -1.0 x 10-4 M ERTA, with a detection limit of 3.12 x 10-8 M. A unique feature of our work is that the 3D zeolitic analcime was fabricated using an ecofriendly procedure from aluminum foil that is accessible and low-cost. The developed sensor can also be utilized in the pharmaceutical industry in quality control tests, offering a rapid and ecofriendly way of analysis.& COPY; 2023 Vietnam National University, Hanoi.

AB Permanent magnets are expected to play a crucial role in the realization of the clean economy. In particular, the neodymium-iron-boron (Nd2Fe14B or NdFeB) magnets, which have the highest energy density among rare earth permanent magnets, are needed for building more efficient windmill generators, electric vehicle motors, etc. Currently, near-net shape magnets can be either made through sintering and compression molding with extensive post machining or directly through injection molding. However, injection molding has a loading volume fraction limitation of 0.65 for nylon binders. A novel method of manufacturing bonded permanent magnets with loading fraction greater than 0.65 has been demonstrated using big area additive manufacturing (BAAM) printers. As energy density is directly proportional to the square of the magnet loading fraction, magnets produced using BAAM printers require less volume and magnetic material compared to that of injection molded magnets on average. A comparative life cycle assessment shows that this difference in magnetic powder consumption nearly constitutes the difference in the environmental impact categories. Even after assuming recycled magnetic input, the BAAM magnets perform better environmentally than injection molded magnets, especially in the ozone depletion category. Since BAAM printers can accommodate even higher loading fractions, at scale, BAAM printers possibly can bring about a significant decrease in rare earth mineral consumption and environmental emissions. Furthermore, single screw extrusion enables BAAM printers to have high print speeds and allow them to be economically competitive against injection molding. Therefore, BAAM printed magnets show great promise in transitioning towards the clean economy.

AB The building industry needs new design approaches to minimize resource consumption and negative environmental impacts. This study proposes a lightweight hybrid profile that combines a thin steel shell and a polymeric lattice core. The core density and internal structure variation possibilities control the slender steel profile's loadbearing capacity and optimize the hybrid structure's weight because of a synergy of the composite section components. The test campaign employs a 3D printing technology for prototyping the lattice core because the manufacturing preciseness (including the internal stiffener structure) is vital for structural optimization and developing adequate numerical models. A straightforward example illustrates the proposed concept. Lateral compression tests on 100 mm long fragments of the slender rectangular hollow section (RHS) 200/100/4 mm (height/width/thickness) profile prove the mechanical efficiency of the proposed hybrid section concept. Reducing the RHS fragment length ensures the experimental identification of the stiffening mechanism in the polymeric insert using a digital image correlation (DIC) technique and simplifies the numerical model. The 3Dprinted lattice polymeric core added only 28% to the weight of the hybrid RHS fragment and increased its mechanical resistance twice compared to the reference empty shell fragments. This effect is equivalent to raising the profile thickness from 4 mm to 6 mm, resulting in a 1.5-times increase in weight. Using recycled plastics, adhesive connecting the inserts, and optimizing the internal geometry of the core stiffeners, depending on the loading conditions, may further increase the economic benefits of the proposed hybrid profile concept.

AB This paper presents a high-precision CMOS fluorescence photometry sensor using a novel lock-in amplification scheme based on switched-biasing and ping-pong auto-zeroing techniques. The CMOS sensor includes two photodiodes and a lock-in amplifier (LIA) operating at 1 kHz. The LIA comprises a differential low-noise amplifier using a novel switched-biasing ping-pong auto-zeroed scheme, an automatic phase aligner, a programmable gain amplifier, a band-pass filter, a mixer, and an output low-pass filter. The design is fabricated in 0.18-mu m CMOS process, and the measurement shows that the LIA can retrieve noisy input signals with a dynamic reserve of 42 dB, while consuming only 0.7 mW from a 1.8 V supply voltage. The measured results show that the LIA can detect a wide range of incident light power from 8 nW to 24 mu W. The proposed design is encapsulated in a 3D-printed housing allowing for real-time in vitro biomarker detection. This ambulatory platform uses an LED and a fiber optic to convey the excitation light to the sample and retrieve the fluorescence signal. Experiments with a beads solution diluted in PBS demonstrate that the sensor has a sensitivity of 1:100 k. Experimental results obtained in vitro with NIH3T3 mouse cells tagged with membrane dye show the ability of the prototype to detect different densities of cell culture. The portable prototype, which includes optical filters and a small 30 mm x 36 mm x 30 mm printed circuit board enclosed inside the 3D-printed housing, consumes 36.7 mW and weighs 120 g.

AB Cementitious-glass composite bricks (CGCBs) with 3D-printed reinforcement structures made of PET-G could be an innovative production method that relies on recycling glass waste (78%) and PET-G (8%). These bricks offer a promising solution for the construction industry, which has a significant impact on climate change due to its greenhouse gas emissions and extensive use of natural aggregates. The approach presented in this article serves as an alternative to using conventional building materials that are not only costlier but also less environmentally friendly. The conducted research included mechanical tests using digital image correlation (DIC), utilized for measuring deformations in specimens subjected to three-point bending and compression tests, as well as thermal investigations covering measurements of their thermal conductivity, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat. The results highlighted the superior thermal properties of the CGCBs with PET-G reinforcements compared to traditional cementitious-glass mortar (CGM). The CGCBs exhibited a 12% lower thermal conductivity and a 17% lower specific heat. Additionally, the use of specially designed reinforcement substantially enhanced the mechanical properties of the bricks. There was a remarkable 72% increase in flexural strength in the vertical direction and a 32% increase in the horizontal direction.

AB The paper discusses various aspects of the interrelation between climate and structures as part of the biosphere's ecosystem. Structural design is hereby understood as a subsystem of humanity, seen as a biological organism, and the climate, as part of the organism's abiotic environment. Possibilities within recent advancements in digitalization and automation to adopt structural design to climatic loading conditions and to mitigate the effect of the manufacturing of structures on the climate are presented as core disciplines of the research group 'Climate&Structures' and are placed within the ecosystem's interrelations. These disciplines are: observation and simulation of climatic loading phenomena(icing, snow- and wind loading), adaption of structures to these with parametric multi-objective and topology optimization, and realization of these structures with additive manufacturing with circular and recycled construction materials.

DT Review
AB Currently, in the metallurgical industry, there is a transition from linear toward circular economy models. In this context, it is necessary to generate closed cycles of material and energy flows with a view to achieving decarbonization and efficiency of industrial processes. In this paper, ceramic wastes generated in the continuous casting of steel or in the supplier's plants due to breaks or failure of ZrO(2 )nozzles through manipulation produces considerable quantity of wastes. The purpose of this study is to valorize them as secondary raw ceramic materials source to produce new refractory pieces using additive manufacture. In this case the technology proposed is the Filament Deposition Method (FDM) as an alternative to 3D printing technology. The results obtained at each stage carried out during the development of the ZrO2 pieces are described. Finally, the physical properties and structural characteristics determined by different microscopy techniques, on the obtained samples, are detailed.

AB Bone tissue engineering (BTE) is critical for addressing bone defects caused by aging populations, chronic diseases, and millions of annual road injuries, yet its potential is hampered by high costs, regulatory delays that deter investment, and healthcare's environmental footprint, which accounts for 8.5 % of the United States' emissions and continues to rise. BTE advancement must prioritize affordability, regulatory efficiency, and climate-conscious innovation to ensure equitable access and sustainability. This work conducts a comparative life cycle assessment (LCA), techno-economic analysis (TEA), and entropy-weighted sustainability indices (SI), a data-driven overall score that weighs economic and environmental metrics by their variability, of stereolithography (SLA) three-dimensional (3D) printing and electrospinning (ES) for polycaprolactone-based scaffold preparation. Results show SLA reduces energy demand per kilogram of scaffold compared to ES, attributed to ES's energy-intensive solvent evaporation and high-voltage fiber formation. When bioactive nanofillers were incorporated, SLA remained cost-competitive and environmentally favorable, whereas ES showed steep increases in energy use, solvent consumption, and ecotoxicity, largely attributed to chloroform. Entropy-weighted SI values reflected these trends: SLA led the ranking, its nanofiller variant remained viable, while ES (with and without nanofillers) performed poorest due to compounded environmental and economic burdens. Adopting solvent recovery systems, such as condensation and closed-loop recycling as well as green solvents and renewable energy, could trim the high energy demand and solvent-intensive processes.

AB Polymeric matrix composites have been widely used in the marine field. In this study, the tribological behavior under seawater-lubricated conditions of pure Polyamide 12 (PA12), micron-SiC and nanometer SiC and SiO2 particle-reinforced PA12 composites, which are prepared by selective laser sintering (SLS), were studied. The seawater absorption, hardness, contact angle and tribology performance were investigated. The results show that the addition of micron- and nano-SiC particles and nano-SiO2 particles could decrease the seawater adsorption and contact angle, and increase the hardness. Under seawater conditions, the addition of micro SiC particles can reduce the friction coefficient and wear loss, whereas the addition of nano-SiC and -SiO2 particles increases the corresponding values. The specimen printed with recycled powder has a higher friction coefficient, while having a better wear resistance. However, it increases the width and depth of the wear track in some locations. The wear mechanisms of the composite specimens are also analyzed. This was the result of the combined effects of fatigue wear and abrasive wear under seawater conditions. The latter plays a dominant role under seawater conditions. This study may provide a valuable reference for the further research and application of polymeric matrix composites in marine engineering equipment.

AB Plastic pollution has become a pressing global crisis that threatens biodiversity and reduces the adaptability of the ecosystem to climate change. Additive manufacturing technologies hold promise in the context of distributed recycling and sustainability. The present work elaborates on developing low-cost, robust feedstocks with improved toughness based on postconsumer polyethylene terephthalate, rPET, and micronized scrap tire rubber powder (MRP) for additive manufacturing. The effects of a series of nonreactive (polystyrene-block-polybutadiene-block-polystyrene (SBS) and polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS)) and reactive compatibilizers (polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene-g-maleic anhydride (SEBS-g-MA), poly(ethylene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (EGMA), and poly(ethylene-co-methyl acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (EMAGMA)) on the mechanical and rheological properties of rPET/MRP composites were investigated. rPET/MRP composites comprising compatibilizers with glycidyl moieties showed relatively higher impact strength and elongation at break. Rheological measurements revealed that incorporating MRP into rPET in the presence of compatibilizers remarkably increases melt viscosity, making the composite formulation suitable for extrusion processing. Differential scanning calorimetry results disclosed that reactive compatibilizers favorably reduce composite crystallinity compared to non-reactive ones, which are ascribed to the formation of long-chain branches. The potential of rPET/MRP filaments for fused deposition modeling was screened by using a low-budget desktop 3D printer. It is envisioned that the findings of this study will improve resource efficiency and the supply chain to achieve a waste-free economy and sustainability.

AB The recent COVID-19 emergency has led to an impressive increase in the production of pharmaceutical vials. This has led to a parallel increase in the amounts of waste glass; manufacturers typically recover material from faulty containers by crushing, giving origin to an unrecyclable fraction. Coarse fragments are effectively reused as feedstock for glass melting; on the contrary, fine powders (<100 microns), contaminated by metal and ceramic particles due to the same crushing operations, are landfilled. Landfilling is also suggested for pharmaceutical containers after medical use. This study aims at proposing new opportunities for the recycling of fine glass particles, according to recent findings concerning alkali activation of pharmaceutical glass, combined with novel processing, i.e., binder jetting printing. It has already been shown that pharmaceutical glass, immersed in low-molarity alkaline solution (not exceeding 2.5 M NaOH), undergoes surface dissolution and hydration; cold consolidation is later achieved, upon drying at 40-60 degrees C, by a condensation reaction occurring at hydrated layers of adjacent particles. Binder jetting printing does not realize a full liquid immersion of the glass powders, as the attacking solution is selectively sprayed on a powder bed. Here, we discuss the tuning of key parameters, such as the molarity of the attacking solution (from 2.5 to 10 M) and the granulometry of the waste glass, to obtain stable printed blocks. In particular, the stability depends on the formation of bridges between adjacent particles consisting of strong T-O bonds (Si-O-Si, Al-O-Si, B-O-Si), while degradation products (concentrating Na ions) remain as a secondary phase, solubilized by immersion in boiling water. Such stability is achieved by operating at 5 M NaOH.

AB It was understood that 3D printing concrete mixtures (3DPC) have special requirements in terms of rheological properties compared to conventional concrete. It was found that there are no acceptance criteria, standards or guidelines for 3DPC and existing standards do not provide guidance on the mix design. It was observed that the development of mix design is necessary for the wider application of 3DPC. In this article, the effects of materials used in 3DPC mixtures on the printability performance of mixtures, especially rheological properties, were investigated by examining the studies in the literature. It was observed that use of sulfoaluminate-cement, which has advantages of rapid-setting, high strength and low-shrinkage, positively affects the performance of 3DPC. It was determined that use of supplementary-cementitious-materials improves rheological properties, while the addition of nano-clay and viscosity modifying agents increases the structural build-up. In addition, it was stated that the use of geopolymer, recycled aggregates and waste materials in the mix design of 3DPC mixtures can contribute to the improvement of the sustainability of 3DPC and the circular economy. It is necessary to control dimensional-stability parameters that occur due to the high dosage of binder content of 3DPC. It was stated that the type and dosage of fibers used were effective parameters in controlling this negativity.

AB Exhausting natural resources, the low biodegradability of plastic wastes, concerns about agricultural waste, and the high demand for composites in diverse fields have driven the world towards the valorisation of fruit-derived wastes in the development of biocomposites. In the present work, a hybrid fruit waste-derived biofillers from orange and banana peel were reinforced with a biopolymer such as poly-lactic acid (PLA) in the fabrication of biocomposites by implementing a 3D printing technique. The effect of loading fractions of biofillers such as 5, 10, 15 and 20 wt% (in equal proportion) on the mechanical performances of the biocomposites was investigated. The mechanical performances of the biocomposites improve with the incorporation of biofillers. However, invariability in the behaviours of the biocomposites with reinforcements was observed. The incorporation of 5 wt% of biofillers with 95 wt% of polylactic acid has resulted in an optimal compressive strength of 70.25 MPa, whereas the reinforcement of 20 wt% of biofillers with 80 wt% of polylactic acid has obtained a maximum hardness and flexural strength of 70 (shore D) and 44.2 MPa, respectively. The optimum impact strength and bending modulus were found to be 21,000 kj/m2 and 2310 MPa, respectively, for the composite having 15 wt% of biofillers and 85 wt% of polylactic acid. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) of the filaments has explored the compatibility between the biofiller and matrix. The fractography analyses have observed a change in the failure modes and mechanisms with the test conditions and compositions. The study has demonstrated the viability of biofillers in composites and offers a sustainable solution to agricultural wastes.

AB This work aims to show how Industry 4.0 (I4.0) can be combined with Lean Management (LM) to achieve the goals of the Circular Economy (CE). For this, a sustainable production and consumption model is designed to in-tegrate Value Stream Mapping (VSM) methodology and I4.0 technologies for CE purposes. We conduct a scoping review followed by Focus Groups Interviews (FGI's) with academic experts to develop this general model, which is then adapted for use in a Digital Factory by FGI's with technological experts and industrial practitioners to eval-uate this application. Constructivist theory is used to name our model "Circular Value Stream Mapping (CVSM) 4.0". This model extends traditional VSM and explores the use of I4.0 technologies in CE contexts. Also, providing a roadmap that helps managers to use VSM-I4.0 to promote circularity continuously and incrementally.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB The growing waste from decommissioned wind turbine blades (WTB) sets environmental challenges, with landfilling as the common disposal method. This study aims to explore the potential of recycling WTB fiber (WTBF) into cement mortar as a reinforcement material, specifically investigating its effects on workability, strength, hydration process, microstructure, and shrinkage. 0.5, 1, and 2 vol% of WTBF were incorporated into mortars with and without superplasticizer (SP), and tests were conducted on flow, strength, and hydration kinetics. The results show that adding WTBF with SP incorporation significantly improves the flowability (11-14.58 cm, 11.8-15.93 cm, and 12.6-17.33 cm, respectively) and compressive strength (up to 100 % increase) of the mortar. Furthermore, SP enhanced WTBF-matrix bonding, reduced porosity, and strengthened the composites. These findings enable the usage of WTBF-reinforced mortars in practical applications, e.g. 3D printed mortar, which requires a typical flowability ranging from 13 to 18 cm.

AB Long-chain aliphatic polyester-18,18 (PE-18,18) ex-hibits high density polyethylene-like material properties and, as opposed to high density polyethylene (HDPE), can be recycled in a closed loop via depolymerization to monomers under mild conditions. Despite the in-chain ester groups, its high crystallinity and hydrophobicity render PE-18,18 stable toward hydrolysis even under acidic conditions for one year. Hydrolytic degradability, however, can be a desirable material property as it can serve as a universal backstop to plastic accumulation in the environment. We present an approach to render PE-18,18 hydrolytically degradable by melt blending with long-chain aliphatic poly(H-phosphonate)s (PP). The blends can be processed via common injection molding and 3D printing and exhibit HDPE-like tensile properties, namely, high stiffness (E = 750-940 MPa) and ductility (epsilon tb = 330-460%) over a wide range of blend ratios (0.5-20 wt % PP content). Likewise, the orthorhombic solid-state structure and crystallinity (chi 70%) of the blends are similar to HDPE. Under aqueous conditions in phosphate-buffered media at 25 degrees C, the blends' PP component is hydrolyzed completely to the underlying long-chain diol and phosphorous acid within four months, as evidenced by NMR analyses. Concomitant, the PE-18,18 major blend component is partially hydrolyzed, while neat PE-18,18 is inert under identical conditions. The hydrolysis of the blend components proceeded throughout the bulk of the specimens as confirmed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements. The significant molar mass reduction upon extended immersion in water (Mn(virgin blends) 50-70 kg mol-1; Mn(hydrolyzed blends) 7-11 kg mol-1) resulted in embrittlement and fragmentation of the injection molded specimens. This increases the surface area and is anticipated to promote eventual mineralization by abiotic and biotic pathways of these HDPE-like polyesters in the environment.

AB This paper discusses the adoption of biomimicry and eco-friendly materials as overarching concepts in interior design education. It aims to investigate how biomimicry and eco-friendly materials can be integrated into the existing and established interior design program curriculum. Changes in green and sustainable design concepts used in student capstone projects, which incorporated the reiteration of learning objectives aimed at enhancing student learning outcomes, were identified. This investigation addressed a gap in knowledge by analyzing the influence of nature-inspired designs on students' problem-solving abilities and creativity. It employed a qualitative case study approach to analyze selected designs that employed biomimicry concepts in functional interior spaces, followed by a visualization stage, in which 3D-printed models were created from recycled and eco-friendly materials, closing the loop on sustainability applications. The study revealed that biomimicry and eco-friendly materials are valuable components of various design curricula, particularly in the fields of environmental studies, architecture, and interior design. This research underscores the urgent need to comprehensively integrate biomimicry and eco-friendly materials into design curricula, fostering a new generation of sustainability-conscious designers equipped to lead transformative change in the future of interior design and beyond.

ID WASTE
AB According to the Waste Management Policy of the European Union, the recycling and reuse of various wastes is considered the most environmentally friendly and advanced waste disposal technology that has the least impact on the environment. By applying the principles of the Circular Economy, plastic waste will extend its life cycle and will be used as secondary materials to create metamaterial structures with improved sound absorption and insulation properties. The aim of this study was to determine plastic potential for use in acoustic structures. Acoustic metamaterial resonators, created from plastic, were measured in an impedance tube according to standards ISO 10534-2 for their sound absorbing and ASTM E2611 for their insulating properties. Two types of plastic, PLA and recycled PET-G, were used in acoustic metamaterial 3D printing process. For sound insulation, combined resonator systems were used to control symmetrical wall sound resonance. Sound absorption of both PLA and PET-G metamaterials were peaking at 1600 Hz with 0.93 and 0.89 sound absorption coefficient, respectfully. The results showed that combined constructions with plastic metamaterials can be integrated into building structures and used as an alternative for improving building acoustics, reducing indoor noise and reverberation time.

AB We investigated the characteristics of a group of 13 Middle Iron Age egg-shaped crucibles and crucible fragments from Tilburg (The Netherlands). We used a combination of optical and chemical analyses, including hand-held XRF, microCT scanning and 3-D printing polarizing light microscopy and SEM-EDX. The chemical analyses confirmed that the crucibles were used for copper alloy metallurgy. Impressions in the lids of the crucibles turned out to be imprints of copper alloy scrap, including fragments of twisted wire and fibulae. Most remarkable, however, is the large proportion of sheet metal among the scrap.
   In order to make crucibles from the local, non-refractory clays, a hitherto unknown ceramic-faience hybrid was used: A combination of clay and halophytic plant ash was mixed with silt into a paste, and this was used to construct the crucible. During firing, the flux would promote melting of the clays and probably prevent catastrophic failure of the crucibles. The resulting glassy groundmass - in which silt grains are embedded and partially dissolved - is rich in Al2O3 as well as in Na2O, K2O, CaO, MgO and Fe2O3.
   It is likely that this technique of crucible manufacture was widespread in Late Prehistory in areas where no refractory clays were available.

AB In this study, porphyrinic zirconium (Zr) MOFs were investigated as heterogeneous photocatalysts for photoinduced electron transfer-reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (PET-RAFT) polymerization of various monomers under a broad range of wavelengths, producing polymers with high monomer conversions, narrow molecular weight distributions, low dispersity and good chain-end fidelity. Screening of various porphyrinic Zr-MOFs (Zn) containing Zn-metalled porphyrinic ligands demonstrated that MOF-525 (Zn) with the smallest size had the best photocatalytic activity in PET-RAFT polymerization, due to enhanced dispersion and light penetration. Oxygen tolerance and temporal control were also demonstrated during MOF catalysed PET-RAFT. Results suggested that the polymerization rates were significantly affected by changing the size and surface area of MOFs, and the heterogeneous MOF photocatalysts could be easily separated and recycled for up to five independent PET-RAFT polymerizations without an obvious decrease in efficiency. Finally, the MOF photocatalysts were utilized to create three-dimensional polymeric objects with high resolution via visible light mediated stereolithography in an open-air environment.

AB The principles governing the selection of an appropriate type of electrochemical flow reactor for use at laboratory or pilot scale are reviewed. Good practice in electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering must be incorporated, together with practical aspects, such as the form of reactants and products, the required performance, ease of assembly, the maintenance schedule and scale-up plans. Diverse electrode forms and reactor designs are illustrated by examples from the authors' laboratories. The versatile parallel plate geometry, often in modular, filter-press format, occupies a prominent position, both in the laboratory and in industry. The simple parallel plate geometry is readily enhanced by inclusion of porous, 3-dimensional electrodes, structured electrode surfaces and bipolar electrical connections, with necessary consideration of the reaction environment, especially potential-and current-distributions, uniformity of flow and mass transport rates, electrode activity, side reactions and current leakage. More specialised electrode geometries, such as concentric reactors, rotating cylinder electrodes, porous electrodes, packed beds, fluidised beds and bipolar trickle towers, are sometimes chosen. Applications span materials recycling, environmental treatment and electrosynthesis. A decision tree to aid the choice of reactor design features is provided. Recent trends, such as fast prototyping of reactors via 3-D printing of flow channels, miniaturisation and use of multi-physics modelling, are highlighted. Future research and development needs are suggested. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented demand for PPE, with single-use face masks emerging as a critical tool in containing virus transmission. However, the extensive use and improper disposal of these single- use face masks, predominantly composed of non-biodegradable plastics, has exacerbated environmental challenges. This research presents an innovative method for mechanically upcycling PPEs used in medical sectors i.e. single use face masks. The study investigates a facile approach for reclamation of infection-free and pure polypropylene (PP) plastic from discarded single use face masks (W-PP) and blends it with various vegetable oil percentages (5, 10 and 20 %), resulting in a versatile material suitable for various applications. Melt flow index, rheological behaviour, DSC and FTIR were employed to investigate the effect of vegetable oil/radical initiator through chemical grafting on W-PP properties. The results demonstrate significant enhancements in the tensile strength and modulus of W-PP when blended with vegetable oil and a radical initiator. There was a marked increase in tensile strength (33 %) and strain (55 %) compared to untreated W-PP, rendering W-PP both robust and flexible. Furthermore, we employed this upcycled W-PP in the fabrication of glass fibre-reinforced composites, resulting in notable enhancements in both tensile strength and impact resistance. The upcycled W-PP demonstrates excellent potential for various applications, such as sheet forming and 3D printing, where the non- brittleness of plastics plays a pivotal role in manufacturing high-quality products. The cost-benefit analysis of this approach underscores the potential of upcycling PPE waste as a sustainable solution to mitigate plastic pollution and conserve valuable resources. The applications of this upcycled material span a wide range of industries, including automotive composites, packaging, and 3D printing.

AB A popular form of additive manufacturing, selective laser sintering (SLS) enables the unprecedented making of complex 3D parts with high mechanical performance. The semi-crystalline polymer polyamide 12 (PA12) has been extensively used in SLS thanks to its superior mechanical properties, broad sintering window, ease of processibility, reduced warpage and porosity. However, low utilization of the costly feedstock hinders the longterm sustainability of SLS in the industry. Reprocessing and reusing the un-sintered materials with quality assurance have thus appeared as an important and time-sensitive problem. Yet, the feedstocks undergo complex thermal and chemical degradations in SLS. Little results exist to uncover fully the sophisticated process and the reusability of PA12 powders. This review aims to present the state-of-the-art on important aspects of aging mechanisms and degradation behaviors of PA12 powders in SLS. We review first the mechanism of PA12 aging at the molecular scale. Then for the properties of the aged powders, we analyze the evolution of microstructures and geometric properties. Besides, for 3D-printed parts with recycled powders, we cover changes of mechanical properties from tensile strength to Young's modulus. Finally, we provide guidelines and principles of parameter settings when using reclaimed PA12 powders.

AB The academic community increasingly embraces the possibilities offered by the Maker movement, with a notable rise in the creation of homemade instruments, particularly in the field of spectroscopy. These instruments are being leveraged to enhance engagement in classes and educational projects. Most of these homemade instruments designed for educational purposes rely on simplified 3D-printed components and/or adapted materials, such as compact discs used as diffraction gratings. This article proposes yet another solution by recycling an optical system from an old liquid chromatograph decommissioned due to obsolete communication protocols. The entire instrument's optical system is used, and the original photodiode array (PDA) was replaced by a modern PDA that could be easily controlled by Arduino and a user interface developed for this intent. A flowchart illustrating the interface operations related to absorbance calculations is presented, followed by a discussion on how the shape of the acquired spectra may be influenced by positioning of the sensor. The raw data obtained in this work can also be utilized to teach concepts related to dark current, baseline correction, instrument calibration, and absorbance. The visible spectra of several substances from the resultant instrument are presented and compared with those of a commercial benchtop spectrophotometer. The approach described here can inspire the recovery and recycling of other outdated instruments, providing opportunities to explore and teach both the physical and computational aspects of chemical instrumentation.

AB Studies on recycled materials emerged during recent years. This paper investigates the properties of sound absorption and transmission loss of the structures of the perforated plastic panel (PPP) backed with the rubber granule panel (RGP). Under production conditions, such a structure could be produced using only waste. The normal incidence sound absorption and transmission loss of the structure was measured using ISO 10534-2 and ASTM E2611-17 standard methods, respectively. In this study, the plastic panel perforation holes were tilted in steps of 15 degrees-45 degrees compared to the vertical axis of the sample. Different thickness rubber panels were used as backing (12 mm, 22 mm and 27 mm). The results showed that the sound absorption and transmission loss increased with the angle of the perforation pore. To compare the different structures, the multi-criteria analysis using the technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) approach was done. The RGP thickness, sound absorption coefficient (SAC) and sound transmission loss (STL) were weighted as a criterion. The results of the multi-criteria analysis showed that the optimal structure for a possible application is PPP45 degrees+ RGP 22 mm, which was ranked highest of all alternatives. The first peak of SAC reached 0.97 at 1000 Hz. In the frequency range of 250-1000 Hz, STL values reached up to 10.4 dB and in the frequency range of 1-4 kHz - 20.1 dB. The results obtained using RGP and PPP show promising development potential for sound absorption and insulation applications.

AB This study presents a systematic effort to develop a sustainable, multifunctional limestone calcined clay composite tailored for 3D-printed concrete construction (LC3-3DPCC), incorporating integrated self-sensing and self-heating capabilities. A targeted formulation strategy was adopted to predict and optimize the mix design using locally sourced clays, ensuring printability, scalability, and material consistency for large-scale applications. A dataset of 287 unique mix designs was generated and evaluated through comprehensive laboratory testing. The data were analyzed using both linear and nonlinear machine learning regression models. Among them, the Random Forest Regression model demonstrated the highest predictive accuracy for compressive strength, flexural strength, and yield stress, leading to the identification of an optimal formulation. To enhance multi-functionality, recycled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were incorporated into the optimized LC3-3DPCC matrix, resulting in improved self-sensing and self-heating performance. The enhanced composite achieved a compressive strength of 35 MPa, a flexural strength of 4 MPa, and a yield stress of 700 Pa, while maintaining high structural integrity and printability. Real-time structural monitoring under cyclic and monotonic loading was confirmed through piezo-resistivity-assisted digital image correlation analysis. The material also exhibited efficient Joule heating, reaching temperatures of 30 degrees C, 60 degrees C, and 80 degrees C at applied currents of 0.5 A, 1.0 A, and 1.5 A, respectively-demonstrating its suitability for heating functions and cold-weather environments. Notably, interlayer bond strength increased by 52 % compared to the plain composite and by 121 % relative to the optimized clay-based 3DPCC. The CNT-modified composite retained 71 % of its compressive strength at 300 degrees C and 44 % at 700 degrees C, indicating excellent thermal durability. Microstructural analyses using X-ray computed tomography and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) clarified mechanical isotropy and thermal stability improvement mechanisms. Collectively, these findings confirm that the proposed multifunctional LC3-3DPCC is a promising candidate for scalable, sustainable, and net-zero construction, offering real-time monitoring and efficient self-heating functionalities. Future work should explore large-scale production, field deployment, and long-term performance. Supporting Python codes are provided in the Appendix (A) and supplementary materials.

AB The utilization of the waste clay brick powder (CBP) as an alternative binder in cementitious materials is an effective approach to recycling clay brick waste. Many research articles have been published on concrete containing CBP, but a systematic review on the performance of CBP and its blended concrete has been lacking until now. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive review of the utilization of CBP for lowcarbon cement concrete and alkali -activated concrete, offering readers an effective pathway to understand its performance. This review article provides a detailed introduction on the preparation technology of CBP, as well as the micro -macro properties of cement concrete and alkali -activated concrete incorporating CBP. The results showed that CBP with irregular micro -structure is rich in silicon, aluminum, and oxygen elements, and exhibits good pozzolanic activity and micro -aggregate filling effect. Optimizing CBP particle size, replacement rate and curing condition can prepare the cement concrete with good micro -macro properties. Besides, there is an optimal CBP replacement rate, alkali concentration, Na/Si and Si/Al molar ratios for the alkali -activated concrete containing CBP. The mix of CBP in concrete obviously reduces the CO2 emission and energy consumption, showing an excellent environmental benefit. The mechanical activation treatment, active admixture and nano -particle modification can improve the properties of CBP blended concrete. In the future, CBP can be widely used in 3D printed concrete, high performance and ultra -high-performance concrete, lightweight concrete, fully recycled concrete and CO2 sequestration concrete.

AB The catalytic upgrading of polyethylene-derived pyrolysis oils using ZSM-5 zeolites enables the cost-effective production of valuable chemicals from plastic waste, fostering a circular economy through resource recycling. To achieve high-performance catalyst design, balancing active site accessibility and selectivity is crucial. Here, we report a monolithic ZSM-5 @nano-ZSM-5 core-shell catalyst (mZ@nZ) fabricated via vat photo-polymerization, in situ crystal engineering, and a one-step desilication-recrystallization treatment. The micro -morphologies and microstructures of the core-shell catalysts are investigated using electron microscopies and physical adsorption methods. The mZ@nZ catalyst features a self-supporting face-centered cubic macrostructure with a layer of compositionally heterogeneous ZSM-5 zeolites, which comprises a catalytically benign nano-ZSM-5 shell (Si-rich) and a catalytically active ZSM-5 core (Al-rich). Abundant mesopores are created in mZ@nZ through desilication and zeolite agglomeration processes. This design offers three significant advantages: (1) enhanced active site accessibility via in situ zeolite growth, (2) surface passivation using a Si-rich shell to minimize side reactions, and (3) improved diffusion facilitated by the hierarchical structure, reducing light olefin secondary reactions and coke formation. Compared to pristine monolithic ZSM-5 and a reference pelletized catalyst, the mZ@nZ catalyst demonstrates superior performance in terms of higher light olefin yields and se-lectivities, with enhanced resistance to coking in the model compound and real LDPE pyrolysis oil cracking reactions. This research showcases a rational design approach at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, of-fering valuable insights for advancing polyolefin waste upgrading and novel zeolite catalyst design.

AB The low solubility of ozone in water limits its oxidation reaction rate, while microbubbles can enhance the gas-liquid mass transfer process and effectively improve the mass transfer rate of ozone. In this study, we set up an ozone microbubble generation system, with an internal recycle, a self-made releasing device using 3D printing and other designs to keep the system running steadily, with constant pressure, high ozone concentrations, and slow microbubble dissipation rate. This study investigated the ozone feed rate and optimization of mixing conditions through the test. With the increase of ozone feed rate, the average concentration of ozone in the solution tends to increase linearly, then decreases slightly after reaching the maximum 13.75 mg/L. On a stable running of the system, the ozone concentration of the solution could reach 13.29 mg/L. The ozone microbubble was then investigated by calculation and measurement of bubble disappearance time, particle size and mass transfer capacity. This study found the particle size of bubbles was about 42.66 mu m and K-La (20) was 10.712 min(-1). The system's applications were then studied to demonstrate the effect of ozone microbubbles. Under strong alkaline conditions and without acid adjustment, COD of printing and dyeing wastewater could reach Chinese first-class A discharge standards after treatment with ozone microbubbles. Another experiment proved that ozone microbubble solution of 8 mg/L had more than 99% killing effect on Escherichia coli.

AB Persistent organic pollution (POPS) with the feature of difficult to be degraded, highly toxic and global spread has become a challenge for the whole human beings. Recently, piezo-photoelectric catalysis is emerging as a promising way to degrade organic pollutions. In order to avoid the secondary pollution caused by the difficult recycling of powder catalyst, a three-dimensional barium titanate (BaTiO3, BT) scaffold is prepared by direct writing technique in this study, of which the surface is decorated by titanium oxide (TiO2, TO) nanowire arrays. Piezoelectric potential can be generated in the BT scaffold, especially in the direction parallel to the direct writing printing, and the piezoelectric electric field can effectively promote the separation of photo-generated carriers. This design of the structure can effectively produce a larger deformation compared with the bulk structure in the catalytic process, and it can also increase the contact area between the catalyzer and solution with enhanced reactive site. Due to the piezo-phototronic coupling effect, BT piezoelectric ceramic scaffold with TiO2 array exhibits an excellent dye degradation efficiency, of which the rate constant reaches approximately 0.109 min-1 for 100 mL of 10 mg/L of indigo carmine (IC) degradation. This work demonstrated that 3D piezoelectric ceramics by direct ink writing method shows a great potential in promoting the practical application of catalysis.

AB Recyclable thermosets and thermoset composites with covalent adaptable networks (CANs, or dynamic covalent networks) have attracted considerable attention in recent years due to the combined merits of excellent mechanical and thermal properties, and chemical stabilities of traditional thermosets and recyclable, remoldable, and reprocessable attributes of thermoplastics. In this paper, we present an overview of the current strategies for synthesizing recyclable thermosets based on CANs, which involve recyclability, reprocessability, and possible rehealability. The recent literature examples are categorized based on the underlying controlled-cleavable linkages such as transesterification, DA/retro-DA chemistry, imine bonds, disulfide metathesis, dynamic B-O bonds, hemiaminals/hexahydrotriazines, and acetal linkages. Various degradation and malleability methods and resulting mechanical properties of the recycled thermosets and thermoset composites are presented. The emerging applications of recyclable thermosets and thermoset composites, with emphasis on their usage in adhesives, biomedical materials, wearable devices, coatings, and 3D printing materials, are also illustrated. Finally, a perspective on the challenges and future perspectives is briefly summarized. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Chinese Society for Metals.

AB Increasingly shortage of river sand and fresh water has prompted the construction industry to use seawater sea sand concrete (SSC). The construction industry selected fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) bars to replace steel bars due to its excellent corrosion resistance. However, after long-term service in an alkaline environment or a humid environment, FRP reinforced seawater sea sand concrete (FRP-SSC) will be degraded as well. This paper provides an overview of characteristics and degradation of the SSC and FRP, the bonding performance of FRP bars embedded in SSC, and the mechanical performance evolution of FRP-SSC beams and columns. The combination of SSC with 3D printing concrete and the replacement of natural coarse aggregate with recycled coarse aggregate are also proposed as future research needs. As summarized in this investigation, the current research provides a solid foundation for the further development in this field, which can promote the widely acceptance and application of FRP-SSC materials and structures.

AB To promote environmental sustainability, this research investigated the potential of utilizing recycled polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as raw material in material extrusion (MEX) additive manufacturing (AM). To enhance its mechanical response, carbon black (CB) was employed as the filler in nanocomposite formation. Filament extrusion of the mixture at different concentrations produced printable feedstocks for MEX AM. Rheological analysis (viscosity and material flow rate) showed that the CB introduction to the matrix was beneficial for consistent layer deposition, while differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analyses verified the thermal stability of the nanocomposites during processing. Mechanical properties were optimized, with increases in modulus (27.8% and 25.8%, respectively, in tensile and bending loadings) and tensile strength at optimal CB loadings. Dynamic mechanical analysis revealed the viscoelastic response of the nanocomposites. Raman and energy dispersive spectroscopy provided element-related insights. Surface morphology and parts structure were observed employing scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography, respectively, revealing a positive impact on the AM parts due to the CB presence in the nanocomposites. The 4 wt.% in CB content nanocomposite was the optimum one. This research pioneers the development of new sustainable nanocomposite filaments and highlights the potential of next-generation MEX-based AM.

AB Flexible micro-supercapacitors, with high energy and power density, and using materials with a low environmental impact are attractive for next-generation energy storage devices. Carbon-based materials are widely used for supercapacitors but can be increased in energy density via combination with metal oxides. Red mud is an iron-oxide-rich by-product of aluminum production, which needs to be more widely utilized to reduce its environmental damage. To achieve a flexible micro-supercapacitor device with increased energy density, a laser-induced graphene (LIG) supercapacitor is realized from a polyimide substrate, decorated with red-mud nanoparticles (LIG-RM), employing a solid-state ionic liquid electrolyte with a mixture of poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ([EMI][TFSI]), and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate ([EMIM][BF4]). The fabricated two-electrode flexible device, in an interdigitated planar design, with inkjet-printed silver current collectors, has a high energy of 0.018 mWh cm(-2) at a power of 0.66 mW cm(-2), with 81% of capacitance retained after 4000 cycles and good resistance to bending and flexing. The high energy storage performance, brought about through the combination of graphene and red-mud nanoparticles, which would-if not utilized-be an environmental liability, shows a promise as a material for future energy storage with low environmental impact.

AB This work investigates the feasibility of recovering and regenerating uncured methacrylate-based photocurable resin from a previous 3D printing build job before being reused for a consecutive second and third build job. In detail, it was investigated the impact of the uncured resin reuse on the optical performance of 3D-printed micro-optofluidic (MoF) devices designed for absorption-based optical slug flow monitoring by comparing their optical performances when manufactured with fresh or one-time or two-times reused resin. The devices were fabricated using Projection Micro-Stereolithography with three different resin batches: fresh, one-time or two-times reused resin. Optical performance testing was conducted using an air-water slug flow. A Design of Experiment approach was employed to systematically evaluate the MoF device optical performance variability due to resin reuse. Despite Fourier Transform Infrared Attenuated Total Reflection spectroscopy has revealed minor chemical reduction in the methacrylate monomers composition of reused resins when compared to fresh one, a negligible reproducibility error in terms of optical detection performance for the MoF devices manufactured with different batches of resin was unveiled. This is attributable to stable resin cross-linking, ensuring a uniform refractive index and reliable optical sensing performance. The recovery, regeneration, and reuse of photocurable resin provide a sustainable solution to recycling challenges posed by utilization of uncured acrylate and methacrylate resins, as material waste in manufacturing can be reduced without compromising optical performance, thus promoting environmental sustainability. The presented sustainable approach allows to reduce costs, since the high cost of photopolymer resins limits large-scale manufacturing, besides minimizing environmental impact.

AB Recently, biomass-derived porous carbon has received attention in many fields due to its low-cost and environmental friendliness. Attribute to the high dielectric loss of carbon materials, the microwave absorbers which is made of biomass-derived porous carbon can meet the low-cost, simple preparation and basic microwave absorption. However, the high permittivity of carbon material tends to limit its impedance matching over a wide frequency range. Here, we prepared several porous carbon materials with different microstructure by a simple chemical activation process. Then, a double-layer structural absorber (SA) was designed based on these porous carbon materials. Specifically, the porous carbon composing the first and second layer of SA has great impedance matching, and strong dielectric loss, respectively. Therefore, the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB, reflection loss below -10 dB) of SA can reach 13.8 GHz (from 4.2 GHz to 18 GHz). This work provides a new prospect for the recycling and reusing of waste biomass materials and a facile low-cost mute to design the broadband structural microwave absorbers.

AB Due to a continued rise in the production and use of plastic products, their end-of-life pollution has become a pressing global issue. One of the biggest challenges in plastics recycling is the separation of different polymers. Multi-block copolymers (MBCPs) represent an efficient strategy for the upcycling of mixed plastics via induced compatibilization, but this approach is limited by difficulties associated with synthesis and structural modification. In this contribution, several synthetic strategies are explored to prepare MBCPs with tunable microstructures, which were then used as compatibilizer additives to upcycle mixtures of polyolefins with other plastics. A multi-block(+) strategy based on a reactive telechelic block copolymer platform was introduced, which enabled block extension during the in situ melt blending of mixed plastics, leading to better compatibilizing properties as well as better 3D printing capability. This strategy was also applicable to more complex ternary plastic blends. The polymer multi-block strategy enabled by versatile MBCPs synthesis and the multi-block(+) strategy enabled by in situ block extension show exciting opportunities for the upcycling of mixed plastics.

AB Polymeric foams can be found virtually everywhere due to their advantageous properties compared with counterparts materials. Possibly the most important class of polymeric foams are polyurethane foams (PUFs), as their low density and thermal conductivity combined with their interesting mechanical properties make them excellent thermal and sound insulators, as well as structural and comfort materials. Despite the broad range of applications, the production of PUFs is still highly petroleum-dependent, so this industry must adapt to ever more strict regulations and rigorous consumers. In that sense, the well-established raw materials and process technologies can face a turning point in the near future, due to the need of using renewable raw materials and new process technologies, such as three-dimensional (3D) printing. In this work, the fundamental aspects of the production of PUFs are reviewed, the new challenges that the PUFs industry are expected to confront regarding process methodologies in the near future are outlined, and some alternatives are also presented. Then, the strategies for the improvement of PUFs sustainability, including recycling, and the enhancement of their properties are discussed.

AB Simply expressed, the circular economy implies that the people living on Earth should reuse and recycle the products that are currently in use as long as possible and reduce the waste produced, thus reducing CO2 emissions. The latter goal is fundamental from the perspective of mitigating the well-known greenhouse effect and the consequent global warming observed at the planetary scale. Under these conditions, advanced electrodeposition processes can play a fundamental role in the optimization of materials use and in the reduction of the energetic footprint for a wide variety of industrial processes. The aim of the present paper is precisely to suggest how this is possible, showing readers the potential that electrodeposition holds for efficient manufacturing of many different products that have a huge significance for industry.

AB Chemical recycling of plastic waste has attracted attention from all around the world, because it offers a sustainable solution to the problem of plastic waste accumulation and helps create a circular plastic economy. One of the sustainable methods of conserving resources and protecting the environment is chemical depolymerization or recycling of commercial plastics. In this regard, polylactic acid (PLA) is a widely used plastic material for three-dimensional (3D) printing of objects and for various other purposes ranging from agricultural films to food packaging. In this work, the chemical depolymerization of PLA was investigated using Cu-CeO2 as a catalyst, yielding methyl lactate (ML) as a selective product under mild reaction conditions. This environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach aims to achieve closed-loop chemical recycling of PLA waste. The reaction conditions were optimized to attain good catalytic activity and product selectivity. The PLA was completely depolymerized in the presence of the Cu-CeO2 catalyst at 140 degrees C in 8 h. The specific rate of the reaction was found to be 0.0189 mol m-3 s-1 based on the amount of ML formed in the reaction. 1H NMR spectroscopy was used to support the detailed depolymerization mechanism. Experiments on a gram scale were also carried out to demonstrate the utility of the developed reaction protocol. The effectiveness and sustainability of the designed protocols were investigated by the evaluation of the green metric parameters, including environmental factor (E), energy economy coefficient (epsilon), and environment energy impact factor (xi). This study offers a sustainable, low chemical input, and environmentally friendly method for chemical recycling of waste PLA materials.

AB Polymer networks with dynamic bonds, also known as covalent adaptable networks (CANs) combine the superior mechanical properties and chemical resistance of thermosets with the ability to be reprocessed, a feat formerly attributed only to thermoplastics. Inspired by an evergrowing body of research on dynamic poly(8-hydroxy ester) networks, a polyacrylate/epoxy-acid thermoset was designed, which contains a high concentration of 8-hydroxy ester bonds that partake in transesterification reactions that facilitate the repair and recycle of the cured material at feasible temperatures. Firstly, liquid formulations are subjected to UV light to initiate acrylate homopolymerization to obtain the intermediate, partially-cured material. A subsequent thermal treatment triggers the epoxy-acid reaction, which improves the mechanical properties and helps increase the likelihood of transesterifications as new 8-hydroxy ester groups are formed. The effect of thermal post-treatment and the choice of catalyst on viscoelastic properties and stress relaxation behavior of these materials is studied. Results show that, transesterification reactions reach equilibrium in less than 4 h at 180 degrees C during which time the overall crosslinking density increases further. As to the choice of catalyst, a commonly used zinc acetylacetonate outperforms an imidazole-type base. Thanks to the dynamic bonds, damaged samples can be repaired fully using simple procedures. Recyclability is tested by grinding pristine samples and re-molding them under pressure and temperature. Practically complete recovery of viscoelastic properties is confirmed.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) of biomedical materials provides enormous opportunities to fabricate multifunctional and structurally designed frameworks for tissue engineering, such as dental implants and bone substitutes. Despite several advantages of the binder jet 3D printing technology over other AM methods, for example, no limitations in materials selection, high materials recycling efficiency, no thermal stress development, no need to support materials, and the possibility of fabrication of printing functionally graded materials, the fabrication of biomedical-grade titanium alloys with high-density, fine microstructure, and low pickup of impurities is still challenging. This work presents the effects of powder particle size and 3D printing conditions on the microstructural features and mechanical properties of Ti-6Al-4V alloy. The formation of large and inter-aggregate pores during binder jetting is demonstrated and discussed. Design and selection of particle size distribution with a mean diameter of similar to 20 mu m and large span and positive skewness are proposed to minimize binder-induced powder aggregation and fabricate green parts with a density of 65 +/- 1% PFD (pore-free density). Dilatometric studies under a partial pressure of argon (0.1 bar) determine that sintering just above the alpha/beta transus temperature (similar to 980 degrees C) provides a high strain rate to remove pores, but high-temperature sintering (>= 1250 degrees C) is required to attain 97% PFD. The successful fabrication of high-density Ti-6Al-4V parts (>= 96% PFD) with the microstructure comparable to metal injection molding (MIM) titanium parts (approximate to 100 mu m alpha grains + beta lattes) is demonstrated. The tensile strength and elongation values fall in the range of 880 +/- 50 MPa and 6 +/- 2% (depending on the processing condition), which is comparable with metal injection molded parts and superior to the laser powder bed fusion technology concerning ductility. The content of carbon (<0.02 wt.%) and nitrogen (0.01 wt.%) also falls in the standard region of metal injection molding. However, oxygen pickup during sintering moderately increases the oxygen content (for 30-50%) over the standard level. The concentration of interstitials entrapped in the metal is comparable to that of parts manufactured by the powder bed fusion process, but the mechanical properties are better matched with the commercial titanium alloy. The fabrication of the titanium alloy as per the ASTM F2885 standard provides an excellent opportunity for the binder jetting process to develop custom-made biomaterials.

ID PDMS
AB A series of bottlebrush silicone elastomers have been synthesized by using a solvent-free process based on hydrosilylation and thiol-ene reactions. The use of thiol-functionalized PDMS effectively suppresses the side reactions of Si-H bonds during the hydrosilylation process. The dynamic covalent C-S bonds in these materials can undergo reversible cleavage under UV illumination, imparting excellent forming and self-healing properties under UV. Remarkably, the elastomer not only retains a low elastic modulus but can heal within seconds, exhibiting toughness of up to 86% of its original value. The synthesis approach also allows small silane molecules to be efficiently grafted as spacers onto the polymer backbone, and the effects of both spacers with different steric hindrances and functional groups are reported. Spacers with different steric hindrances significantly altered the stiffness, while those with functional groups, such as fluorinated spacers, effectively modified the surface property. Potential applications are illustrated by using the material in 3D printing by digital light processing, healing under UV and recycling.

AB Aluminum alloys have been increasingly used in structural engineering owing to their desirable mechanical properties coupled with their recyclable and sustainable nature, which can significantly contribute to reduction in construction carbon emissions and development of circular economy. Many research projects have been prompted to investigate the structural performance of aluminum alloy structures and develop accurate design methods. This paper provides a review of recent developments in research related to the use of aluminum alloys for structural purposes. The material categories and properties of aluminum alloys are first discussed, in combination with the material corrosion and recycling. Previous research work on material and structural response of aluminum alloy structures is then reviewed, including existing test results on material coupons, stub columns, long columns, beams, beam-columns, connections, web crippling, structures and relevant numerical simulations. This is followed by the research gaps identified and the corresponding future research work recommended. Lastly, with a view to the future, the use of 3D printing for the construction of new aluminum alloy structures and the application of fiber reinforced polymer to strengthen the existing aluminum alloy structures are explored.

AB The increasing global concern over sustainability in learning factories and plastic waste necessitates innovative solutions for efficient sorting and recycling processes. Here, we present a research endeavor that combines cutting-edge technologies to address this challenge within the context of learning factories. Specifically, we have integrated a YOLOv5 Object Detection Model with a Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Sensor manufactured by Matoha company into a portable, flexible, and cost-effective decision-making architecture. Our system is designed to classify plastic waste items into object types (bag, bottle, or 3D-printed part) using object detection and into polymer types (e.g., PE, PET) using spectroscopy. The YOLOv5 model achieved an accurate mean average precision (mAP[0.5:0.95]) of 0.929. Additionally, this research showcases the successful integration of state-of-the-art technologies and demonstrates their practical application towards implementation into learning factories. The project promotes interdisciplinary learning by merging computer vision, sensor technology, and waste management, offering students and professionals hands-on experience in solving complex, real-world problems. Infusion of this project in learning factories can catalyze future projects whereby students can implement portable waste sorting mechanisms in their universities to attract stakeholders to transform these technologies to larger scales and address the critical environ-mental plastic waste problem.

AB Artificial aggregates have been investigated in various composite materials as a green alternative but most studies evaluate strength or function separately. Here, we propose a concept of meta-aggregate to balance the strength and permeability of concrete composite. Specifically, we exploit strut-based lattice metamaterials made from recycled PLA as artificial aggregates in cementitious and asphalt matrix to create meta-aggregate permeable concrete (MPC) and meta-aggregate permeable asphalt mixture (MPA). Our experimental results indicated that compared with the control unit, the average permeability of MPC units increased by 129 % and the compressive strength decreased by 29 %, while the permeability of MPA units increased by 142 % and the tensile strength was similar. The changes in strength and function come from the geometric form and size of the meta-aggregate. Our study suggests that the proposed meta-aggregates have great potential as programmable, sustainable, and multifunctional components in next-generation composites.

AB This paper investigates the implementation of additive manufacturing (AM) in circular production (CP) through the 6R strategy. The methodology allows designers to reconsider their decisions, correct mistakes or make specific changes to the model in all phases of the design process, from initial drawings to the finished product. CP enables the complete realisation of the model/prototype with a particular focus on environmental protection and the additional use of recycled waste. The proposed algorithm is tested through the design and manufacturing of an enclosure of an industrial temperature transmitter. Some of the weaknesses of additive manufacturing, such as mechanically damaged surfaces, surface roughness, and tearing of models on weak joints, have been investigated, and recommendations for mitigation are given.
   The mechanical product finishing methods are described in detail in the paper as well, and in order to check the prototype functionality, some tensile, thermal stress and drop tests were performed, and the results were analysed and discussed. It was shown that significant savings in time, cost and material can be achieved by implementing AM in realising a fully functional prototype while simultaneously in line with the demands for CP and 6R.

AB Waste segregation is an essential aspect of a smoothly functioning waste management system. Usually, various recyclable waste types are disposed of together at the source, and this brings in the necessity to segregate them into their categories. Dry waste needs to be separated into its own categories to ensure that the proper procedures are implemented to treat and process it, which leads to an overall increased recycling rate and reduced landfill impact. Paper, plastics, metals, and glass are just a few examples of the many dry waste materials that can be recycled or recovered to create new goods or energy. Over the past years, much research has been conducted to devise effective and productive ways to achieve proper segregation for the waste that is being produced at an ever-increasing rate. This article introduces a multi -class garbage segregation system employing the YOLOv5 object detection model. Our final prototype demonstrates the capability of classifying dry waste categories and segregating them into their respective bins using a 3D -printed robotic arm. Within our controlled test environment, the system correctly segregated waste classes, mainly paper, plastic, metal, and glass, eight out of 10 times successfully. By integrating the principles of artificial intelligence and robotics, our approach simplifies and optimizes the traditional waste segregation process.

AB Morphing matter that change shapes and properties in response to external stimuli have gained significant interests in material science, robotics, biomedical engineering, wearables, architecture, and design. Along with functional advances, there is growing pressure and interest in considering the environmental impact of morphing matter during its life cycle. The unique manufacturing and usage of morphing matter means that existing sustainable design frameworks and principles for general physical products may not apply directly. For example, manufacturing morphing matter often requires designing and predicting materials' behaviors over time, and using devices fabricated with morphing matter often involves harnessing renewable energy and self-reconfiguration, which pose unique sustainability opportunities and challenges. This study reflects and summarizes the field's practice in sustainable manufacturing, transport, use, and end-of-life handling of morphing matter. The term "sustainable morphing matter" (SMM) is coined, suggesting that sustainability-conscious factors can become an integral component of morphing matter. In addition, ways to apply sustainability-conscious factors to augment the existing design pipeline of morphing matter are presented, and more quantitative and algorithmic-level developments are needed to apply these factors rigorously to the design process.

AB The third industrial revolution is marked by the fast-growing evolution of Additive Manufacturing (AM) in construction. This transformative shift is driving the automation of construction processes to bestow economic, sustainable, and functional habitats on earth and space. AM has enabled innovative manipulation and design of materials, architectures, and structures in the construction industry. The feasibility of using a diverse range of both original and recycled materials, freeform architecture, topology optimization and bio-inspired design, manufacturing precision, minimal production time and labor, has effectively advanced the objectives. This has resulted in a substantial reduction in costs while simultaneously enhancing safety, sustainability, and functionality of AM in construction. To fulfill the automation in construction objectives, AM trajectory is advancing from off-site toward on-site construction by upscaling, collective robotic work, remote, aerial, and lunar construction. Despite design challenges related to factors like reinforcement, bonding at layer interfaces, rheology adjustment, and cracking resistance, along with practical considerations including cost, harmonized/synchronized robotic function, drone stability, and precision in deposition, AM is making remarkable advancements that surpass expectations. Looking forward, bee-sized drones may be witnessed swarming to construct structures in diverse environments, including remote areas on Earth and in space. Given these developments, this study reviews the advancement of AM in the construction industry, tracing its evolution from individual terrestrial to collective, aerial and extraterrestrial construction. In addition, the most suitable AM techniques encompassing bio-inspired technology and topology optimization are elaborated. Preferred materials and their characteristics for terrestrial, aerial, and extraterrestrial construction, as well as pavement repair are discussed. Furthermore, appropriate testing methods are introduced, and the challenges and limitations associated with AM construction on terrestrial, aerial, and lunar surfaces with insights for the future of AM are elucidated.

AB The industrial adoption of microbial electrosynthesis (MES) is hindered by high overpotentials deriving from low electrolyte conductivity and inefficient cell designs. In this study, a mixed microbial consortium originating from an anaerobic digester operated under saline conditions (similar to 13 g L-1 NaCl) was adapted for acetate production from bicarbonate in galvanostatic (0.25 mA cm-2) H-type cells at 5,10,15, or 20 g L-1 NaCl concentration. The acetogenic communities were successfully enriched only at 5 and 10 g L-1 NaCl, revealing an inhibitory threshold of about 6 g L-1 Na+. The enriched planktonic communities were then used as inoculum for 3D printed, three-chamber cells equipped with a gas diffusion biocathode. The cells were fed with CO2 gas and operated galvanostatically (0.25 or 1.00 mA cm(-2)). The highest production rate of 55.4 g m(-2) d(-1) (0.89 g L-1 d(-1)), with 82.4% Coulombic efficiency, was obtained at 5 g L-1 NaCl concentration and 1 mA cm(-2) applied current, achieving an average acetate production of 44.7 kg MWh(-1). Scanning electron microscopy and 16S rRNA sequencing analysis confirmed the formation of a cathodic biofilm dominated by Acetobacterium sp. Finally, three 3D printed cells were hydraulically connected in series to simulate an MES stack, achieving three-fold production rates than with the single cell at 0.25 mA cm(-2). This confirms that three-chamber MES cells are an efficient and scalable technology for CO2 bio-electro recycling to acetate and that moderate saline conditions (5 g L-1 NaCl) can help reduce their power demand while preserving the activity of acetogens.

AB Composite materials based on wood filler are promising materials that are actively conquering the market. This is due to the advantages of using these materials in various fields: weather resistance and environmental compatibility, easy machining and possibility of recycling. Furthermore, it is sustainable use of wastes of timber sawing and furniture and woodworking industries, as well as low-grade wood. Wood powder is also known to be one of the components of consumables used in additive 3D printing technologies. Over the last decade, the commercial use of 3D printers has increased rapidly due to the fact that it allows creating prototype objects of complex shape based on a computer model. Experimental studies were carried out to determine the tensile strength and rheological properties of a composite made of polylactide 4043D, untreated wood powder brand 140 and wood powder thermally modified at 200 and 240 degrees C. The composite is intended for creation of three-dimensional objects by extrusion using a 3D printer. It was found that with an increase in the amount of filler in the composite, the tensile strength decreases. Also, samples with thermally modified filler show an increase in tensile strength in comparison with samples with untreated filler. Prototypes of 3D threads with different composition were obtained, during the study of which the melt flow index was examined. It was found that with increasing temperature of wood filler treatment the melt flow index increases. With a lower content of wood powder in the melt composition, there is a 2-fold increase in the melt flow index. The knowing of the rheological properties of the resulting compositions will allow achieving maximum performance and reduction of energy and production costs.

ID SUSTAINABILITY
AB Laser beam melting (LBM), also known as selective laser melting, is a powder bed fusion type of additive manufacturing (AM) technology used to fabricate metal parts from metal powder. LBM is a promising technology that offers new opportunities for increasing resource efficiency. The aim of this study was to compare environmental impacts of conventional manufacturing methods with AM for a real industrial application. Analysis was performed on the repair process of a burner used in a Siemens industrial gas turbine. The results of this study show that the repair process based on AM provides significant reduction in material footprint (abiotic depletion potential), primary energy consumption, and carbon footprint compared to conventional machining and welding processes. Even though the AM process has increased power and inert gas consumption on the shop floor, the complete life cycle shows that the conventional processes have a much higher environmental footprint from material use upstream. Different recycling models of nickel-based alloy and stainless steel scrap strongly influence the cradle-to-gate life cycle footprint. The results show that an AM process can have a sustainability advantage if it is designed in a holistic cradle-to-gate approach. The study also shows potentials for the LBM machine developers for entry into the industrialization of AM. Energy reduction potentials were identified during the idle mode, during operation mode from the supply of cooling duty, and also related to inert gas consumption. Careful consideration of these potentials can further improve the primary energy footprint of the LBM process.

AB This paper reports the effect of almond skin powder (ASP) reinforcement in polyamide (PA)6 on mechanical, rheological, thermal and morphological properties of feed stock filament for use on commercial open source fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup without any hardware/ software alteration. It has been observed that initially up to 7.5wt% proportion of ASP in PA6 the melt flow index (MFI) of composite matrix increased, further increase in proportion of ASP in PA6 resulted into decrease of MFI. Taguchi approach-based design of experiment has been used to analyze the Young's modulus of composite matrix (for ensuring sufficient stiffness while operation on FDM) with different wt% proportions of ASP in PA6, prepared with twin screw extrusion (TSE) under different conditions of barrel temperature, screw speed and applied load. Barrel temperature of TSE is most significant parameter (having contribution of 82.75%) for Young's modulus. The results are also supported by optical photomicrographs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).

AB Additive manufacturing is one of the advanced manufacturing methods, and one of its techniques is fused filament fabrication (FFF) in which the parts are produced by different filaments. One of the widely used components in various industries is porous lattice structures, which are lightweight structures composed of repeating unit cells that can have different sizes and designs. These structures can also be produced from recycled or environmentally friendly materials. In this study, lattice structures were produced using the FFF method with two different types of filaments: plain polylactic acid (plain PLA) and carbon fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (reinforced PLA). Three different types of unit cells were used: square, circular, and hexagonal. Each of these cells was also produced in three different pattern types (simple, central, and upper). The printed samples were placed in three different environments for a week: air, room-temperature seawater solution, and seawater solution at a temperature above 45 degrees C. Afterward, compression tests were performed on them. The results showed that the highest compressive failure force was obtained for lattice structures with square unit cells, followed by hexagonal and circular unit cells. Additionally, samples placed in the high-temperature seawater solution had the highest compressive force, which is related to better layer adhesion due to the high temperature. The samples placed in the room-temperature seawater solution experienced a decrease in compressive force. Furthermore, the samples printed with plain PLA filaments had a higher compressive force, and adding carbon fibers to the base filament material caused a decrease in compressive force. The results showed that among all lattice structures, the highest compressive force was obtained for the simple design and those printed with plain PLA filament that were placed in the warm environment: 3229.67N for square lattice structure and 1324.22N and 1907.21N for circular and hexagonal lattice structures, respectively. To better analyze the results, force-displacement diagrams of the fractured samples were examined, along with photography of the fractured samples and their SEM images.

AB A process for the chemical recycling of degradable polylactide (PLA) has been developed, to convert its disposable wastes into small-sized products for further use as value-added starting materials for specialty products. A microwave-assisted alcoholysis reaction, using diols and tetrabutyl orthotitanate (TBT) catalyst, was employed. The effects of the types of diols and PLA/diol feeding ratios on the structures and properties of the resulting alcoholized products were examined by using ethylene glycol (EG), propane-1,3-diol (PDO), and butane-1,4-diol (BDO). The PLA/diol ratios were varied from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt. The products were characterized by ATR-FTIR, H-1 NMR, and 2D-NMR HMQC and HMBC spectroscopy. The products compost to diol-capped lactate sequences with different lengths, i.e., lactate, lactyllactate, and poly-lactate. The yield of the shortest lactate was about 65% for the LBDOT11 system, and 90% for the LEGT11 and LPDOT11 systems, when a feeding ratio of 1:1 wt/wt was employed. The yield decreased with an increase in the ratios, from 1:1 to 4:1 wt/wt. In contrast, the yields of longer lactyllactate and poly-lactate increased with an increase in the ratios. In terms of OH-endcapping efficiency, the products have two structures: (A) LA-O-(CH2),OH and (B) LA-O-(CH2)(x)-O-LA. The contents depend on diol types and the PLA/diol feeding ratio. The alcoholized products were then used as starting polyols in the preparation of lactide-based polyurethanes (PUs) by reacting with 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI) and BDO chain extender. The resulting PUs exhibit promising mechanical and thermal properties. These PUs are suitable for use as either single-component materials, e.g., 3D-printing filaments and degradable adhesives, or as toughness-enhancing agents for brittle polymers, especially PLA.

AB The metal lost to waste deposits during the print circuit board (PCB) production is a potentially important component of the technological resource cycle. Follow the dramatically development of electronic industry, China becomes the biggest PCB producer in the world. Because of the complex manufacturing process, including electroplating, chemical plating, etching, pattern transfer(fixing and developing) and so on, all those lead to huge amount industrial water demanding and large sewage producing which contains high copper and other organic/heavy metal residuals. With more consideration for the environment protection and resources recycle, call for comprehensive utilization of those heavy metals effluents, so that sewage treatment, precious metal recovery and water reuse were very meaningful tasks. Membrane technique such as reverse osmosis (RO) can increase the concentration of heavy metal pollutants in effluents water; make heavy metals easy for electro-deposition. Combination those two techniques, electronic circuit industry wastewater can be treated effectively, recovery of heavy metals in wastewater at the same time implementation the real means of the water reuse. In this paper, PCB wastewater treatment was carried out by secondary treatment with ultra low pressure RO membrane and 3D electro-winning devices to investigate heavy metals remove and recovery performance changing with pressure, pH, temperature, current density. Operating stability of ultra low pressure membrane and the possibility of water reuse is also discussed.

AB Chemical upcycling of commercial plastic materials to their starting monomers is of great significance to address the end-of-use issues of plastic materials and offers a closed-loop pathway for plastic sustainability. Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) materials, synthesized by ring-opening polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL), have been applied commercially in the fields of medical equipment and 3D printing materials. Here, we demonstrate the first "epsilon-CL to PCL to epsilon-CL" and "PCL to epsilon-CL to PCL" closed-loop processes under the catalysis of magnesium bis[bis(trimethylsilyl)amide] [Mg(HMDS)(2)]. The thermodynamic parameters Delta H-p degrees < 0 and Delta S-p degrees < 0 for epsilon-CL indicate that epsilon-CL showed a ceiling temperature. After bulk polymerization of epsilon-CL, the direct bulk depolymerization of the resultant PCL to epsilon-CL was achieved under high temperature (180 degrees C) and vacuum (0.07 mbar) conditions via a domino-type unzipping depolymerization mode. The depolymerizations of PCL commodities were also achieved, providing monomeric epsilon-CL with high yield (up to 98%), selectivity and purity. The resultant epsilon-CL could smoothly repolymerize into new virgin-quality PCL materials, thus establishing its circular life cycle.

AB Additive manufacturing electrochemistry offers transformative potential for developing bespoke, low-cost electrodes for electroanalytical applications. However, ensuring sustainability in this rapidly expanding field is essential, requiring alignment with green chemistry principles, the circular economy, and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This study addresses this challenge by developing the first biochar-based conductive additive manufacturing feedstock, combining recycled PLA, bio-based castor oil, carbon black, and softwood-based biochar (SWP10). Filaments with varying SWP10 content (1-40 %) were produced, with up to 20 wt% SWP10 (SWP10-20) maintaining good printability. Electrochemical characterisation identified SWP10-2.5 (2.5 wt%) as the optimal composition, achieving improved electrochemical performance while enhancing sustainability. Both SWP10-2.5 and SWP10-20 were tested for electroanalytical applications, demonstrating their effectiveness in detecting carbendazim, an important environmental contaminant. The electrodes exhibited low limits of detection (57 nM for SWP10-2.5 and 78 nM for SWP10-20) and wide linear ranges (0.2-40 mu M), outperforming several previously reported sensors. Furthermore, both electrodes were successfully applied for the detection of carbendazim in spiked real river and lake water samples, achieving recoveries between 92.5 % and 107.2 %. These results demonstrate that by optimising biochar and carbon black ratios, it is possible to enhance the sustainability of conductive additive manufacturing materials without compromising electrochemical or electroanalytical performance. This work highlights a pathway toward more environmentally friendly electroanalytical platforms, supporting the SDGs while addressing real-world challenges in environmental monitoring and sensor development.

AB Developing sustainable, high-performance materials is crucial to meet the growing demand for eco-friendly, multifunctional solutions across industries. Traditional plastic-based foams can take centuries to degrade, contributing significantly to environmental pollution. This study introduces an innovative organic-inorganic composite ink suitable for direct ink writing to fabricate high-strength, sustainable foam materials. The ink formulation is composed of gelatin, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, and Co3O4-loaded silica nanofibers (named as CSNFs). The foam prepared from this ink is named as GC, where GC-10 represents GC containing 10 wt% CSNFs. The nanoscale dimensions and high surface area of CSNFs facilitate physical entanglement within the foam matrix. Additionally, H-bond nanoconfinement, combined with the organic-inorganic multi-scale network, significantly enhances the structural stability of GC foams. The formulated ink demonstrates excellent printability, forming a porous structure after freeze-drying. GC-10 exhibits enhanced thermal insulation (0.048 W/ m center dot K), high mechanical performance (compression modulus of 3111.1 +/- 300 kPa), and reduced smoke toxicity, with a peak CO release 72.4 % lower than GC. Notably, GC foams can be recycled without any loss in performance. Additionally, CSNFs are recoverable through centrifugation, minimizing environmental impact. This closed-loop recycling strategy, incorporating water solvent recovery, addresses a critical need in sustainable materials engineering. It emphasizes the potential of organic-inorganic integration in developing highperformance, multifunctional materials.

AB Rice straw is an agricultural waste, disposal of which through open burning is an emerging challenge for the ecology, especially in under developed countries. Green composites manufactured using rice straw as reinforcement material provides a more avant -grade technique that not only nurtures environmental stewardship by reducing waste and carbon footprint but also fosters prosperity through innovative economic opportunities for rice cultivators. While earlier published reviews are focussed on rice husk based composites and their properties, this review attempts to critically examine the effect of fiber content, fiber size, fiber surface modification, compatibilizer addition, micro and nanofillers, hybridization, etc., on mechanical, thermal, morphological properties, etc. Of rice straw based composite materials. Review has been specifically categorised according to the type of matrix materials which include conventional polymers, bio degradable polymers, recycled polymers. Review also dwells upon various applications of rice straw based composites as that is essential for sustainable upcycling of agricultural wastes like rice straw. Novel methods like manufacturing rice straw based composites using 3D printing are also compiled in the review along with future potential of rice straw composites in the sustainable filler -based biocomposites manufacturing sector.

AB Owing to its superior durability, good biocompatibility, and high recycling capability, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been widely applied into making prosthetic implants, liquid permeable membranes, corrosion-resistant pipes, etc., and gains its popularity in packaging, consumer goods, and chemical industries. Injection molding and blow molding are two most common conventional processes of making HDPE products. These conventional processes, however, are considered time-consuming and labor-intensive since molds are usually needed prior to fabricating parts. Moreover, manufacturing complex-structured parts (such as lattice and cellular structures) is a challenge for these conventional manufacturing processes. Facing these problems, it is crucial to find a time- and laborsaving process, which can be used to manufacture complicated structures in a cost-effective way. Additive manufacturing (AM) is such a process that needs no mold and is more affordable to create complex and highly customized parts. Among all types of AM processes, fused deposition modeling (FDM), which is primarily designed for thermoplastic materials, seemed to be a benevolent process for fabricating HDPE parts. Based on reported publications, however, it is difficult to print HDPE materials using FDM due to the problems of warping, shrinking, and weak bonding between printed HDPE parts and the substrate. In addition, the FDM- printed HDPE parts can demonstrate defects of porosities and delamination. To improve the printability of FDM, we conducted preliminary experiments and optimized processing parameters. For the first time, we added carbon fiber (CF) into HDPE to make CF-reinforced HDPE composites (CF- HDPE) using FDM and investigated the effects of CF on part quality, microstructure characteristics, and mechanical properties (including tensile properties and dynamic mechanical properties) of CF-reinforced HDPE composites. Experimental results show that the addition of CF was beneficial for not only improving the printability of FDM and quality of printed composite parts, but also for enhancing mechanical properties (such as Young's Modulus and ultimate tensile strength) of the parts.

AB Metal additive manufacturing (MAM), also known as metal 3D printing, is a rapidly growing industry based on the fabrication of complex metal parts with improved functionalities. During MAM, metal parts are produced in a layer by layer fashion using 3D computer-aided design models. The advantages of using this technology include the reduction of materials waste, high efficiency for small production runs, near net shape manufacturing, ease of change or revision of versions of a product, support of lattice structures, and rapid prototyping. Numerous metals and alloys can nowadays be processed by additive manufacturing techniques. Among them, Al-based alloys are of great interest in the automotive and aeronautic industry due to their relatively high strength and stiffness to weight ratio, good wear and corrosion resistance, and recycling potential. The special conditions associated with the MAM processes are known to produce in these materials a fine microstructure with unique directional growth features far from equilibrium. This distinctive microstructure, together with other special features and microstructural defects originating from the additive manufacturing process, is known to greatly influence the corrosion behaviour of these materials. Several works have already been conducted in this direction. However, several issues concerning the corrosion and corrosion protection of these materials are still not well understood. This work reviews the main studies to date investigating the corrosion aspects of additively manufactured aluminium alloys. It also provides a summary and outlook of relevant directions to be explored in future research.

AB The AEC industry is facing constant demand for resources, excessive raw materials' consumption, and waste generation. Now, the construction industry is responsible for about 50% of the global solid waste, which negatively impacts the environment. However, construction techniques and building practices have been advanced over the years with an increased interest in sustainability, especially in energy conservation and in adopting the Industrial Production layer of Construction 4.0 (i.e., modular prefabrication, 3D concrete printing, and BIM). The concept of circular economy (CE) has also been identified as a potential solution to achieve sustainability in building construction through the design, construction, and deconstruction processes that enhance waste management based on the framework that is related to reducing, reusing, and recycling. Additionally, geospatial data complements advanced digital technologies by providing a collaborative platform that supports CE as a practical approach to sustainability. Thus, this study will provide a straightforward methodology for developing a BIM-GIS sustainable design model that integrates circular economy's concept to enhance construction sustainability in order to minimize lifecycle waste based on various construction methods (i.e., conventional, modular, and 3D printing). The proposed model integrates tools and data for the evaluation and planning of construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) management strategies at the design stage, including quantifying the wasted materials, selecting the waste handling equipment, and estimating the associated costs with the loading and hauling of waste at the various stages of a project. The proposed model will provide designers with the ability to evaluate the construction and deconstruction waste (CDW) during the design of buildings based on their different construction methods at the early stage of design using the design for deconstruction (DfD) concept; sustainable construction methods; and deconstruction process for waste management, which will lead to a suitable construction method.

AB This study aims to enhance the mechanical properties of polylactic acid by incorporating black tea waste as an economical and sustainable additive capable of being recycled. The black tea waste, after the hot water color removal process, is milled to a fine and uniform powder size. The combination of these particles with polylactic acid is carried out using a twin-screw extruder. Specimens of pure polylactic acid and biocomposites containing 3 and 5 wt% black tea waste are manufactured using a hot press machine at a temperature of 200 degrees C. The filaments are also successfully extruded for three-dimensional printing purposes. Scanning electron microscopy images reveal that in the polylactic acid-3% tea biocomposite, the tea particles are appropriately dispersed within the polylactic acid matrix. The tensile test results indicate that biocomposite polylactic acid-3% tea has the highest mechanical properties, with a tensile strength of 67 MPa, demonstrating a 34% increase compared to polylactic acid. Furthermore, the biocomposite of polylactic acid-3% tea waste exhibits the best performance with a fracture energy of 2.5 kJ/m(2) in the impact test. Hence, polylactic acid-3% tea biocomposite can be recommended as a suitable sustainable substitute. Finally, numerical simulations are performed on biocomposites containing double keyhole notches. This analysis is conducted to observe the behavior of biocomposite models with double keyhole notch under mixed-mode loading. The critical fracture load of the models is calculated using the strain energy density criterion. It is observed that an increase in the notch inclination angle and notch radius leads to a decrease in the fracture load in the models.

AB The production and disposal of plastics have become a major global concern owing to its non-biodegradable properties in the environment. The recycling of apple biowaste as a value-added bioplastic precursor offers a solution to this waste disposal issue. In this study, readily available apple waste was converted into bioplastic through the delignification of cellulose cum reinforcement by nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC) extracted from the biowaste. The results indicated that the inclusion of apple waste and delignification effect had improved the bioplastic storage modulus (0.42-4.23 MPa) and brittleness in terms of hardness (5.22-0.51 kg). Morphological analysis revealed that the NCC had an average size of 70 nm and was homogeneously blended within the bioplastic matrix. The integration of the apple waste into the bioplastic promoted biodegradability, evident from the maximum weight loss of 58.1% after 4 weeks of biodegradation test, thus presenting a novel and alternative biodegradable plastic. The obtained results support apple waste as a potential filler for bioplastic development in food packaging, medical implants, 3D printing and water bottles.

AB Additive manufacturing is one of the most prominent technologies seen as an enabler for circular economy strategies, including the development of additive symbiotic networks. There is a gap in the literature regarding the understanding of how additive symbiotic networks can be developed, namely in identifying the wastes and by-products and additive manufacturing technologies that can be used to valorize these resources. This study aims to review the existing literature on the topics of industrial symbiosis and additive manufacturing. A sample of 83 documents was reached, with only 25 highlighting the potential for developing industrial symbiosis networks in the additive manufacturing context. Results show that the most used technologies to incorporate recycled materials included fused deposition modelling, fused filament fabrication and selective laser melting. Regarding waste or by-products exchanges, plastic polymers, biological wastes and metal powders are some of the most frequently exchanged materials. This makes evidence of the additive manufacturing industry's potential to develop additive symbiotic networks in which wastes and by-products from other industries may be used as material inputs for additive manufacturing processes and technologies.

AB Porous metamaterials with three-dimensional periodic minimal surfaces provide new inspirations to develop catalytic hydrogen generation materials owing to their excellent mass transfer. Herein, ten kinds of Al porous metamaterials with triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) were prepared by selective laser melting (SLM) for hydrogen generation from Al-H2O reaction. The structures of TPMS type Al materials significantly affect their hydrogen generation performance, and the increased reaction area and liquid flow rate of TPMS structure can effectively improve the galvanical replacement reaction and rapidly form a Ni/Al battery, thus accelerating the hydrogen generation. Compared to conventional aluminum powder, the obtained Diamond type Al porous metamaterial exhibit short induction period, high hydrogen generation yield (81.4 % after 2 h reaction) and high hydrogen generation rate (468 mL-H2 & sdot;min � 1 & sdot;gAl � 1), easy activation of surface passivation film, good structural stability and convenience to recycle the materials after use. This work highlights a simple, low-cost and optional porous structure design strategy that can be applied in the field of safe and efficient catalytic hydrogen generation.

AB With the advancement of technology and a global shift towards clean energy, the need for rare earth metals is increasing. Scandium, a rare earth metal, has been extensively used over the decades in solid oxide fuel cells and aluminum-scandium alloys that have a vast, evolving market in aerospace, automobiles and 3D printing. However, the market struggles to maintain the supply chain due to expensive production processes and the absence of uniform global distribution of primary sources. Therefore, identification of alternative sources and technological advancements for scandium recovery are needed. To this end, an effort has been made to provide a review of the advances in different technologies applied in scandium recovery from diverse sources. Emphasis has been given to the improvements and upgrades to technologies in terms of environmental impact and recovery efficacy. An attempt has been made to discuss and deliver a clear representation of the challenges associated with every source for scandium recovery and the major developments in solving them. The environmental impact of scandium recovery and recycling has also been discussed.

AB In this study, smart composite materials based on 4D printing technology were used to determine the grasping ability of four-claw gripper of soft robot. First, fused deposition modeling (FDM) is used to prepare polylactic acid (PLA) strips on the surface of a rectangular bamboo substrate to create a single-claw gripper for a smart composite soft robot, while using stimulus (heat) to deform and recover its original shape. Here, the authors first evaluate the deformation and recovery angle of the single-claw gripper of the smart composite soft robot, as well as various processing parameters such as heating temperature and time. This study then used FDM to print PLA ribbons on cross-shaped bamboo sheets to design the four-claw gripper of soft robot and its gripper technology was actuation type. Then, the four-claw gripper of soft robot was used to grab the table tennis ball to test its grasping ability. Finally, four processing parameters (width of claw, pitch of PLA ribbon, heating temperature, and heating time) were applied to determine the grasping ability of the four-claw gripper of soft robot. The optimal processing parameters for the grasping ability of the four-claw gripper of soft robot were width of claw of 20.2 mm, pitch of PLA ribbon of 1 mm, heating temperature of 200 degrees C, and the heating time of 15 s. The authors also applied the operation window of two processing parameters to discuss the success of the grasping ability of the four-claw gripper of soft robot. The innovation of this study is the use of PLA/bamboo composite materials as the four-claw gripper of soft robot and these materials are cheap, easy to obtain, and can be recycled naturally. This study uses a simple thermal stimulus to enable the four-claw gripper of soft robot to easily grasp irregular objects.Highlights The innovative composite material of polylactic acid and bamboo fabricated by 3D printing. Width of claw and heating temperature are the key factors on grasping ability. Operating window of grasping ability appears on four-claw gripper of soft robot.

AB Carbon sequestration in modern cementitious materials has emerged as a critical study domain in the attempt to reduce global carbon emissions. This review analyzes the capacity of diverse and innovative concrete types, such as engineered cementitious composites (ECC), ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC), limestone calcined clay cement (LC3)-based concrete, geopolymer concrete, 3D-printed concrete (3DCP), and recycled aggregate concrete, to sequester and store carbon during the curing stage. With a focused effort on understanding carbon sequestration during curing, this study offers a comprehensive overview and examines the challenges associated with optimizing curing processes, highlighting their impact on the mechanical performance and durability of carbon-sequestered matrices. The effects of different curing methods and materials are examined concerning their influence on concrete performance and the optimization for carbon storage. The study emphasizes perpetual issues and outlines critical research gaps that must be addressed to enhance the efficacy of carbon sequestration in modern concrete systems. Recommendations for future research areas are offered to facilitate the advancement of more sustainable and carbon-efficient cementitious materials.

AB As global awareness of resource scarcity and environmental concerns grows, sustainable manufacturing practices have become imperative. Additive manufacturing (AM), with its high material efficiency and design flexibility, presents a promising pathway toward sustainable industrial transformation. This review explores AM's role in sustainability across its lifecycle: design for AM, in AM, and after AM. In the design for AM phase, strategies such as topology optimisation, part consolidation, and cellular structures reduce material usage and enhance durability. During AM, in-situ process monitoring and closed-loop control improve process reliability, reducing energy consumption and failure rates. Meanwhile, the adoption of sustainable materials-metals, polymers, concretes, and biomaterials-further strengthens AM's potential to advance sustainability. After AM, applications such as repair, remanufacturing, and recycling extend product lifecycles and reduce environmental impact, aligning with circular economy principles. Future perspectives include the integration of artificial intelligence for in-process control and sustainable material development, along with regulatory and circular economy frameworks critical to sustainable AM deployment. Lastly, emerging research trends in advancing sustainability through AM are reviewed. Overall, this review provides a roadmap for academia and industry, offering strategies and insights to maximise AM's contribution to a more sustainable and responsible manufacturing future.

AB Every year, the EU emits 13.4 Mt of CO2 solely from plastic production, with 99% of all plastics being produced from fossil fuel sources, while those that are produced from renewable sources use food products as feedstocks. In 2019, 29 Mt of plastic waste was collected in Europe. It is estimated that 32% was recycled, 43% was incinerated and 25% was sent to landfill. It has been estimated that life-sciences (biology, medicine, etc.) alone create plastic waste of approximately 5.5 Mt/yr, the majority being disposed of by incineration. The vast majority of this plastic waste is made from fossil fuel sources, though there is a growing interest in the possible use of bioplastics as a viable alternative for single-use lab consumables, such as petri dishes, pipette tips, etc. However, to-date only limited bioplastic replacement examples exist. In this review, common polymers used for labware are discussed, along with examining the possibility of replacing these materials with bioplastics, specifically polylactic acid (PLA). The material properties of PLA are described, along with possible functional improvements dure to additives. Finally, the standards and benchmarks needed for assessing bioplastics produced for labware components are reviewed.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable polymer that can replace petroleum-based polymers and is widely used in material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM). The reprocessing of PLA leads to a downcycling of its properties, so strategies are being sought to counteract this effect, such as blending with virgin material or creating nanocomposites. Thus, two sets of nanocomposites based respectively on virgin PLA and a blend of PLA and reprocessed PLA (rPLA) with the addition of 0, 3, and 7 wt% of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2) were created via a double screw extruder system. All blends were used for material extrusion for 3D printing directly from pellets without difficulty. Scanning electron micrographs of fractured samples' surfaces indicate that the nanoparticles gathered in agglomerations in some blends, which were well dispersed in the polymer matrix. The thermal stability and degree of crystallinity for every set of nanocomposites have a rising tendency with increasing nanoparticle concentration. The glass transition and melting temperatures of PLA/TiO2 and PLA/rPLA/TiO2 do not differ much. Tensile testing showed that although reprocessed material implies a detriment to the mechanical properties, in the specimens with 7% nano-TiO2, this effect is counteracted, reaching values like those of virgin PLA.

AB Many engineering programs at universities across the country have dropped machine shop and manufacturing courses from their curriculum due to budget constraints, accreditation requirements, and concerns about student safety. At the University of Portland, we have resurrected and enhanced a hands-on advanced CAD and automated manufacturing course that introduces students to advanced solid modeling techniques in CAD, such as sweeps, lofts, and surfacing methods. In addition, students learn manual machining and vacuum forming in our machine shop, along with learning how to create tool paths for CNC machining their designed CAD parts out of wax on various three axis end mills, a 3D printer, and a 3D laser scanner. The end mills were all refurbished and/or repaired over a period of four years to get this course up and running. A commercial software package, MasterCAM, was used in conjunction with SolidWorks as the platform from which to learn about automated manufacturing. In addition, a MakerBot 3D printer was built from a kit to give students experience with future manufacturing techniques. The 3D laser scanner was student designed and built and creates CAD surface models of parts, useful for learning about reverse engineering. The machinable wax used for machining is recycled, melted down, and formed into blocks again for reuse. This saves considerable money. Our goal has been to enhance design quality in our curriculum through experiential learning. Prior to taking this course, all mechanical engineering students are required to take a solid modeling CAD course to learn the basics. However, our experience has been that students do not conceptually understand the importance of designing for manufacture. Although emphasized in all courses, without the hands-on experience, it is difficult for students to remember to apply fillet radii to the bottom of pockets, for example. When faced with having to fit a block with sharp corners into a machined pocket with its default small corner radii, however, learning is instantaneous. The early outcomes of this course show students have learned a great deal about design for manufacturing and manufacturing techniques from taking this course.

AB Upon the development of a linear economy, global enterprises are facing resource depletion, ecological collapse, and unsustainable economic growth, and the living environment is facing ordeals as well. Taiwan's resources are extremely dependent on imports; hence the need for change in the thinking of economic development is arising. The purpose of this study is, based on the concept of circular economy, to discuss the business model and anticipated benefits of Chyhjiun Jewelry Co. Ltd., by using the method of expert interview, participant observation, and method of secondary data collection with the ReSOLVE framework. The results of the study found the developable ReSOLVE business model of the target company Chyhjiun Jewelry in our case study; the ReSOLVE business model includes the use of renewable energy, maintenance and repair services, modular product design, a recovery mechanism, a virtual online shopping platform, and 3D printing technologies. The model established enterprise recycling model as well as the benefits of green management, of which the research results could reduce costs, help the company in exercising its corporate social responsibility, add value to the brand, and generate anticipated benefits arising from other enterprises' follow-up actions.

AB The reflection of incident sunlight prevents photovoltaic modules from reaching their full energy conversion potential. Recently, we demonstrated significant absorption enhancement in various solar cells by external light trapping, using 3D-printed and milled light traps. In order to facilitate direct module integration, we introduce an external light trapping design concept tackling the reflection issues at the module level. In this module design, a lens array on the module cover glass funnels the incident sunlight through small apertures in a reflective coating at the backside of the cover glass. This adapted cover glass can be applied on a conventional module design. The reflector and the solar cells together form an optical cavity, in which most reflected light is recycled by directing the reflected light back to the solar cell. A unique feature of this light trapping module is its capability to simultaneously recycle the broadband reflection from the metal front grid, the front interfaces, the reflective backside of the cell, and the white back sheet. Moreover, it allows separate integration and contacting of low and high bandgap solar cells for highly efficient hybrid tandem modules that have no current matching related losses. We show five module designs for improved light management combined with additional features such as color and image display. We discuss the optimal harvesting of the diffuse and direct component of the sunlight. The outlook of highly efficient, colored, and even image displaying modules makes this technology an interesting candidate for a new class of photovoltaic modules.

AB The similarity of hydrogels with human soft tissues serves a two-fold purpose: they are convenient, humane tissue substitutes for biomedical testing, while they are also a reliable platform for the development of biocompatible implantable devices and organoids. However, these assets come with challenges with reproducible processing of stable hollow structures that are common transducers of liquids in living organisms, from twodimensional polymeric precursors. Here, we describe a protocol for film-to-tube transformation that is devoid of templates, catalysts, 3D printing, heating, and light, and can be used to prepare hollow hydrogel structures. The resulting hydrogel tubes have tensile strength of up to 45 MPa, turning these materials into the most robust hydrogel materials reported to date. The flexibility and elasticity favor the resulting hydrogel tubes for catheterization of artificial intestinal demonstrating the potential for medical applications. The approach can be applied to prepare structure/function-mimetic organoids such as branched blood vessels and nephrons with higher resolution than additive manufacturing. Then hollow structures are degradable in alkaline solution, and the solution can be recycled to recover the tubular structures. The convenience of the approach described overcomes some of the most challenging aspects of preparation of hollow hydrogel elements.

AB The recycling of biomass into high-value-added materials requires important developments in research and technology to create a sustainable circular economy. Lignin, as a component of biomass, is a multipurpose aromatic polymer with a significant potential to be used as a renewable bioresource in many fields in which it acts both as promising biopolymer and bioactive compound. This comprehensive review gives brief insights into the recent research and technological trends on the potential of lignin development and utilization. It is divided into ten main sections, starting with an outlook on its diversity; main properties and possibilities to be used as a raw material for fuels, aromatic chemicals, plastics, or thermoset substitutes; and new developments in the use of lignin as a bioactive compound and in nanoparticles, hydrogels, 3D-printing-based lignin biomaterials, new sustainable biomaterials, and energy production and storage. In each section are presented recent developments in the preparation of lignin-based biomaterials, especially the green approaches to obtaining nanoparticles, hydrogels, and multifunctional materials as blends and bio(nano)composites; most suitable lignin type for each category of the envisaged products; main properties of the obtained lignin-based materials, etc. Different application categories of lignin within various sectors, which could provide completely sustainable energy conversion, such as in agriculture and environment protection, food packaging, biomedicine, and cosmetics, are also described. The medical and therapeutic potential of lignin-derived materials is evidenced in applications such as antimicrobial, antiviral, and antitumor agents; carriers for drug delivery systems with controlled/targeting drug release; tissue engineering and wound healing; and coatings, natural sunscreen, and surfactants. Lignin is mainly used for fuel, and, recently, studies highlighted more sustainable bioenergy production technologies, such as the supercapacitor electrode, photocatalysts, and photovoltaics.

AB The development of efficient waste valorization strategies has emerged as an important field in the overall efforts for alignment with the environmental goals that have been set by the European Union (EU) Green Deal regarding the development of sustainable circular economy models. Additive manufacturing has emerged as a sustainable method for secondary life product development with the main advantages of it being a form of net-zero waste production and having the ability to successfully transport complex design to actual products finding applications in the industry for rapid prototyping or for tailored products. The insertion of eco-friendly sustainable materials in these processes can lead to significant reduction in material footprints and lower energy demands for the manufacturing process, helping achieve Sustainable Development Goal 12 (SDG12) set by the EU for responsible production and consumption. The aim of this comprehensive review is to state the existing progress regarding the incorporation of sustainable polymeric composite materials in additive manufacturing (AM) processes and identify possible gaps for further research. In this context, a comprehensive presentation of the reacquired materials coming from urban and industrial waste valorization processes and that are used to produce sustainable composites is made. Then, an assessment of the printability and the mechanical response of the constructed composites is made, by taking into consideration some key thermal, rheological and mechanical properties (e.g., viscosity, melting and degradation temperature, tensile and impact strength). Finally, existing life cycle analysis results are presented regarding overall energy demands and environmental footprint during the waste-to-feedstock and the manufacturing processes. A lack of scientific research was observed, regarding the manifestation of novel evaluation techniques such as dynamic mechanical analysis and impact testing. Assessing the dynamic response is vital for evaluating whether these types of composites are adequate for upscaling and use in real life applications.

AB Increasing competitive pressure within industries producing long-living, cost intensive products drive the need to optimize product life cycles in terms of faster time to market, sustainable operation, reengineering and recycling. In this context, complexity of IT systems is growing and has to connect different life cycle phases. Especially new concepts of Product Service Systems (PSS) lead to a connection between product design, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). There are still many challenges concerning interface problems between different IT-Systems. They are caused by different data formats, continuous demand for information or integration of new technologies. Thus, Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) has gained an important role and needs to consider integration of new industry 4.0 solutions like cloud services, big data or cyber physical systems.

AB The effect of heat treatments on the tribological and microstructural properties of 18Ni-300 maraging steel produced using the AM technique, which allows complex geometries, was investigated. The tribological properties of the samples were examined under dry atmospheric conditions through sliding wear tests at varying loads and speeds while maintaining a fixed distance. Studies utilizing spectrographic have unveiled that the material's structure is predominantly layered, consisting primarily of dense acicular martensite, along with recycled austenite and intermetallic components. The highest hardness was recorded in sample S1 with 49.7 HRC, while the lowest hardness was measured in sample S3 with 19.5 HRC. In terms of wear resistance, the lowest wear loss, at 0.098 g, was seen in the S1 sample, whereas the S3 sample displayed the highest wear loss at 0.209 g. With these findings, it can be concluded that the appropriate heat treatment significantly enhanced the tribological properties of 18Ni-300 steel.

AB The large discharge of dyeing and printing wastewater is one of the current environmental problems we face. Photocatalytic technology has strong advantages in degrading dyeing and printing wastewater and has achieved significant results. Coordination polymers are widely used in photocatalysis due to their high specific surface area and regular crystal structure. 3-Nitrophthalic acid (3-NPA), N2H4 & sdot;H2O, oxalic acid (H2ox) and Sr(NO3)2 were used as raw materials to prepare a light yellow crystal [Sr(ox)] (CP-Sr; ox = oxalate) by hydrothermal synthesis. CP-Sr was a 3D network structure directly expanded by oxalic acid, which had excellent visible light catalytic performance. Corresponding data such as X-ray single crystal data are placed in Table 2. CP-Sr exhibited its highest methylene blue (MB) degradation efficiency (71.1 %) at pH = 4 after 70 min of irradiation. The photocatalytic efficiency could be improved by adding H2O2 (84.5 %). CP-Sr exhibited the highest rhodamine B (RhB) degradation efficiency (69.7 %) at pH = 4 after 180 min irradiation. The degradation efficiency with H2O2 was 76.4 %. The photocatalytic degradation results can be described in terms of first-order kinetics. After five times of reuse, it was found that the degradation rate decreased less, so the recycling ability was better. The free radicals which play a major role in the whole photocatalytic process were investigated through free radical trapping experiments and ESR test. Finally, the Mott-Schottky curve of CP-Sr was tested to further explored its possible photocatalytic degradation mechanism.

AB Oysters have been recognized as ecological engineers for aquatic ecosystems, as oyster reefs provide critical habitats and foraging locations for other marine species. In the past few decades, anthropogenic activities have negatively impacted oyster reef ecosystems across the globe, resulting in a significant decline in their population. This review critically examines the causes and extent of oyster reef degradation, as well as the effectiveness of restoration initiatives employed to reverse this decline. Furthermore, this review evaluates the effectiveness of restoration strategies employed to rehabilitate oyster reefs. Different approaches, such as genetic improvement, suitable site selection, and oyster seeding to enhance oyster reef restorations, are critically reviewed in this paper. Furthermore, some advanced restoration approaches such as 3D printing, shell recycling, and acoustics technologies are also discussed in this paper, which opens the new doors for researchers in the field of restoration ecology. Challenges and barriers hindering successful restoration are also addressed, including financial constraints, regulatory complexities, and public engagement. The findings and insights presented herein contribute to the growing body of knowledge on oyster reef ecology and serve as a valuable resource for policymakers, scientists, and conservation practitioners seeking effective strategies for restoring these vital coastal ecosystems.

AB When developing or designing biomimetic robotic fingers with rigid and soft components and integrated sensors, fabrication is often a bottle-neck when assembling and casting processing techniques are used. This study introduces a thermoplastic multi-material fabrication approach that allows the printing of fingers with incorporated sensing elements in a single shot. Thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers based materials have been selected to demonstrate the circular fabrication process. To exhibit the potential of the method, a sensorized multi-material finger was fabricated using polypropylene (PP) for the rigid bone, styrene-based tri-block co-polymer (TPS) for the soft skin and resistive composites based on TPS and carbon black (CB) for the sensing. The 3D printer was equipped with combined pellet- and filament-based extruders to enable the combined fabrication processing of the materials without additional assembling. This allowed the exploration of a range of designs with different geometric and infill properties. To demonstrate the circular process, the fabricated fingers were recycled and the mechanical properties did not result in a visible degradation. The described multi-material fabrication of soft robotic components allows time efficiency of the production method and the reusability of the materials, which contribute to establishing a sustainable circular process in the future.

AB Additive manufacturing that creates three-dimensional objects by adding layer upon layer of material is a new technique that has proven to be an excellent tool for the manufacturing of complex structures for a variety of industrial sectors. Today, knowledge regarding particle emissions and potential exposure-related health hazards for the operators is limited. The current study has focused on particle numbers, masses, sizes, and identities present in the air during additive manufacturing of metals. Measurements were performed during manufacturing with metal powder consisting essentially of chromium, nickel, and cobalt. Instruments used were Nanotracer (10 to 300 nanometers [nm]), Lighthouse (300 nm to 10 micrometers), and traditional filter-based particle mass estimation followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Results showed that there is a risk of particle exposure at certain operations and that particle sizes tended to be smaller in recycled metal powder compared to new. In summary, nanosized particles were present in the additive manufacturing environment and the operators were exposed specifically while handling the metal powder. For the workers' safety, improved powder handling systems and measurement techniques for nanosized particles will possibly have to be developed and then translated into work environment regulations. Until then, relevant protective equipment and regular metal analyses of urine is recommended.

AB Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is a versatile manufacturing technique that utilizes polymer filaments as a raw material. It is appropriate process for integrating recycled biowaste and fibers as reinforcing agents alongside the polymers. This research article delves into the intricate process of fabricating filaments using powder extracted from Electronic Waste (EW), notably Printed Circuit Boards (PCB) and blended with virgin Polylactic Acid (PLA), providing a comprehensive exploration of the methodology involved. The primary pellet in this study was virgin PLA, while flexi PLA F2110 was utilized as a plasticizer. The PCB underwent shredding and grinding into powder particles <= 150 mu m, which was subsequently blended with polymer pellets (1 and 3 wt.%) for the experiment. Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDAX) was utilized to determine the composition of the segregated EW. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) were performed on the EW powder to test its thermal stability and determine its capacity to survive the temperatures required for filament extrusion. The filaments were extruded using a single screw extruder with EW-PCB, and the properties of both the extruded filament and filler particles were assessed through tensile, impact and hardness testing. Thermal analysis and morphology examination of the EW-PCB filler particles confirmed their suitability for filament extrusion. The outcomes of the tensile, hardness and impact tests revealed that the composite filament, containing 3 wt.% EW-PCB, demonstrated significantly greater resistance to tensile load, a higher Young's modulus, increased surface hardness and decreased toughness compared to the other composite filaments (0 and 1 wt.%).

AB The distinctive characteristics and versatile applications of crystalline cellulose have garnered considerable in-terest in the 21st century, making it an emerging and promising material. This review highlights the current state of the art in crystalline cellulose research, with a particular focus on its emerging and advanced applications. The sources, extraction techniques, classification, and modification of crystalline cellulose were also discussed. It was observed that plant biomass is the most utilized precursor for crystalline cellulose synthesis. Findings also revealed that crystalline cellulose-based materials have significant potential for a wide range of applications, including 3D printing, photonics, catalysis, energy storage and generation, electronics, biomedicine, and phar-maceuticals, amongst others. However, there are also several challenges associated with the adoption of crys-talline cellulose-based materials. These include issues related to cost, scalability, recycling, and waste management. This review highlights the need for continued investment in research and development to optimize the properties and manufacturing processes of these materials, as well as for education and outreach to increase awareness and promote their adoption. In summary, this review emphasizes how crystalline cellulose has the potential to tackle critical global issues, including resource depletion and climate change. It also presents prospects for future research and opportunities to adopt these materials.

AB A laminar flow bioelectrochemical systems (BES) was designed and benchmarked using microbial anodes dominated with Geobacter spp. The reactor architecture was based on modeled flow fields, the resulting structure was 3D printed and used for BES manufacturing. Stratification of the substrate availability within the reactor channels led to heterogeneous biomass distribution, with the maximum biomass found mainly in the initial/middle channels. The anode performance was assessed for different hydraulic retention times while coulombic efficiencies of up to 100% (including also hydrogen recycling from the cathode) and current densities of up to 75 mu A cm(-2) at an anode surface to volume ratio of 1770 cm(2) L-1 after 35 days were achieved. This low current density can be clearly attributed to the heterogeneous distributions of biomass and the stratification of the microbial community structure. Further, it was shown that time and space resolved analysis of the reactor microbiomes per channel is feasible using flow cytometry. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB Purpose The aim of this paper is presenting a new application of material obtained from the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) recycling process from electronic equipment housings. Elements of computer monitors were used to prepare re-granulate, which in turn was used to manufacture a filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing technology.
   Design/methodology/approach The geometry of test samples (i.e. dumbbell and bar) was obtained in accordance with the PN-EN standards. Samples made with the FFF technology were used to determine selected mechanical properties and to compare the results obtained with the properties of ABS re-granulate mould pieces made with the injection moulding technology. The GATE device manufactured by 3Novatica was used to make the prototypes with the FFF technology. Processing parameters were tested with the use of an Aflow extrusion plastometer manufactured by Zwick/Roell and other original testing facilities. Tests of mechanical properties were performed with a Z030 universal testing machine, a HIT 50P pendulum impact tester and a Z3106 hardness tester manufactured by Zwick/Roell.
   Findings The paper presents results of tests performed on a filament obtained from the ABS re-granulate and indicates characteristic processing properties of that material. The properties of the new secondary material were compared with the available original ABS materials that are commonly used in the additive technology of manufacturing geometrical objects. The study also presents selected results of tests of functional properties of ABS products made in the FFF technology.
   Originality/value The test results allowed authors to assess the possibility of a secondary application of used elements of electronic equipment housings in the FFF technology and to compare the strength properties of products obtained with similar products made with the standard injection moulding technology.

AB The Earth has entered the Anthropocene, which is branded by ubiquitous and devastating environmental pollution from plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Ecofriendly and at the same time economical solutions for plastic recycling and reuse are being sought more urgently now than ever. With the possibility to recover its building blocks, the hydrolysis of PET waste by its selective biodegradation with polyester hydrolases is an appealing solution. We demonstrate how changing the dielectric properties of PET films can be used to evaluate the performance of polyester hydrolases. For this purpose, a PET film separates two reaction chambers in an impedimetric setup to quantify the film thickness- and surface area-dependent change in capacitance caused by the enzyme. The derived degradation rates determined for the polyester hydrolases PHL7 and LCC were similar to those obtained by gravimetric and vertical scanning interferometry measurements. Compared to optical methods, this technique is also insensitive to changes in the solution composition. AFM and FEM simulations further supported that impedance spectroscopy is a powerful tool for the detailed analysis of the enzymatic hydrolysis process of PET films. The developed monitoring system enabled both hightemporal resolution and parallel processing suitable for the analysis of the enzymatic degradability of polyester films and the properties of the biocatalysts.

AB In the past 20 years, China has made tremendous progress in urbanization and infrastructure construction, but it has also generated a large amount of construction spoil that is difficult to handle. The annual emission of construction spoil in China is huge, but its high value-added resource utilization rate is very low. Currently, it is still mainly landfilling and stacking to construction spoil storage sites, and the current disposal process generates a large amount of carbon emissions. In view of the national strategy of carbon peak and carbon neutral, as well as the current situation of low resource utilization rate of construction spoil, the basic problems at the technical level are explored and the feasible and innovative technical path was put forward.
   Firstly, the definition, composition and harmfulness of construction spoil are expounded. The existing disposal and recycling technologies of construction spoil are divided into four types, including direct reuse, simple treatment and conditioning, solidification and sintering. The development context and regional differences of four types of disposal and recycling technologies of construction spoil in China in the past 20 years are combed, the main research and application directions of those technologies are analyzed, and the technical terms are clarified and defined, and the shortcomings of previous relevant research are pointed out.
   The basic properties of construction spoil are intensively introduced and the scientific principles of four types of disposal and recycling technologies including direct reuse, simple treatment and conditioning, solidification, and sintering, are further revealed. And we suggested that low-carbon solidification technology and carbon-reduction sintering technology are the future development trends.
   Based on the case study of the Pinglu Canal, it is found that the current situation of disposal of construction spoil in China is still relatively preliminary. According to the current situation, the basic problems of low utilization rate of construction spoil at the technical level are analyzed, mainly including insufficient space, insufficient analysis of demand, high disposal costs, and insufficient attention to environmental impacts of the disposal of construction spoil. Then the potential of carbon absorption and sequestration of construction spoil itself and the possibility of reducing carbon emissions in the process of resource utilization and disposal of construction spoil is analyzed.
   Finally, to address these basic problems and in combination with China's dual-carbon strategy, innovative solutions and high-value-added strategies such as recycling at multi-scenario through multi-path, co-processing, and digital technology empowerment are proposed, new potential technologies with low-carbon and carbon sequestration such as raw earth construction and 3D printed soil are suggested, and new technology paths for comprehensive utilization of construction spoil including low-carbon solidification, carbon reduction sintering, and other technologies are put forward.
   With the continuous development of the domestic construction industry, the recycling of construction spoil will provide a new direction for saving natural resources, alleviating urban environmental pressure, and achieving green construction.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) plays a significant role in the 4th Industrial Revolution due to its flexibility, allowing AM equipment to be connected, monitored, and controlled in real time. In advance, the minimum waste of material, the agility of manufacturing complex geometries, and the ability to use recycled materials can provide an advantage to this manufacturing method. On the other hand, the poor strength and durability of the thermoplastics used in the manufacturing process are the major drawback that keeps AM behind common production methods such as casting and machining. Fibre-reinforced polymers can enhance mechanical properties, advance AM from the commonly used polymers, and make AM competitive against conventional production methods. The main focus of the current review is to examine the work conducted in the field of reinforced additively manufactured technologies in the literature of recent years. More specifically, this review discusses the conducted research in the composite fibre coextrusion (CFC) additive manufacturing techniques developed over the past years and the materials that can be used. In addition, this study includes an up-to-date comprehensive review of the evaluation of fibre-reinforced 3D printing along with its benefits in terms of mechanical response, namely tensile, flexural, compression and energy absorption, anisotropy, and dynamic properties. Finally, this review highlights possible research gaps regarding fibre-reinforced AM and proposes future directions, such as deeper investigations into energy absorption and anisotropy, to position fibre-reinforced AM as a preferred fabrication method for ready-to-use parts in cutting-edge industries, including automotive, aerospace, and biomedical sectors.

AB Soft, deformable electronic devices provide the means to monitor physiological information and health conditions for disease diagnostics. However, their practical utility is limited due to the lack of intrinsical thermal switching for mechanically transformative adaptability and self-healing capability against mechanical damages. Here, the design concepts, materials and physics, manufacturing approaches, and application opportunities of self-healing, reconfigurable, thermal-switching device platforms based on hyperbranched polymers and biphasic liquid metal are reported. The former provides excellent self-healing performance and unique tunable stiffness and adhesion regulated by temperature for the on-skin switch, whereas the latter results in liquid metal circuits with extreme stretchability (>900%) and high conductivity (3.40 x 10(4) S cm(-1)), as well as simple recycling capability. Triggered by the increased temperature from the skin surface, a multifunctional device platform can conveniently conform and strongly adhere to the hierarchically textured skin surface for non-invasive, continuous, comfortable health monitoring. Additionally, the self-healing and adhesive characteristics allow multiple multifunctional circuit components to assemble and completely wrap on 3D curvilinear surfaces. Together, the design, manufacturing, and proof-of-concept demonstration of the self-healing, transformative, and self-assembled electronics open up new opportunities for robust soft deformable devices, smart robotics, prosthetics, and Internet-of-Things, and human-machine interfaces on irregular surfaces.

AB The Brundtland Report defined sustainable development as a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. If this definition is applied to the construction sector, a new, circular approach to cementitious materials is required. Additive manufacturing (AM) enables to design material-efficient and monolithic structures that meet physical and chemical requirements of building standards while allowing reuse or high-quality recycling of concrete.
   Here, the environmental impact as well as the circularity potential of an additively manufactured exterior wall, produced by 3D concrete extrusion, are determined. To classify the results, the additively manufactured exterior wall is compared with a conventional concrete construction. Finally, various options for optimizing the printed wall are considered and evaluated. Additive manufacturing enabled significant material savings compared to conventional construction. The environmental impacts strongly depend on the used concrete composition. For example, greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced by 20% when changing the type of lightweight aggregate. The additively manufactured exterior wall exhibited advantages in terms of circularity. Through further development and research, additive manufacturing of concrete can promote a paradigm shift towards sustainable practices.

TI Development of single-sided structure collimation film for direct-lit

SO OPTICS EXPRESS
LA English
DT Article
ID PROVIDE
AB In this paper, we proposed an optical structure to enhance the collimation and uniformity of 405 nm LED backlight modules. The structure is called a single-sided structure collimation film (SSSCF), which consists of a lenticular lens array, slit apertures, and a highly reflective coating surface. A lenticular lens array with slit apertures converts the angle of diffusive incident light into collimated light. The high-reflective coating of the collimation film can reflect back the light that does not enter the slit aperture to the backlight module for energy recycling. Finally, we have developed a direct-lit backlight module with optimized collimation properties (FWHM = +/- 3.4 degrees, gain = 2.3%, NSR = 0) and great uniformity (uniformity > 83.5%). We also demonstrated good consistency between our simulation results with optical measurement. The collimated backlight module developed in this study has great potential for future applications, including high-precision 3D printing objects, liquid crystal displays with high contrast ratio or narrow viewing angles, and telecentric illumination devices used in precision machine vision systems.

AB Efficient recycling of gaseous carbon to chemicals using immobilized microorganisms is possible with reduced water use and power input for gas-liquid (GL) mass transfer using a falling film bioreactor (FFBR). In a FFBR, a wavy laminar liquid film (Re < 200) descends over a cylindrical paper biocatalyst support to (1) provide efficient GL mass transfer without bubbles, (2) provide hydration and nutrients, and (3) remove secreted liquid products. Paper roughness had previously been shown to enhance GL mass transfer. FFBRs (similar to 1 m and similar to 0.1 m) without cells were constructed as prototypes for continuous bioprocessing of gas and evaluated for mass transfer based on liquid film thickness and O-2 k(L)a. Prototype flow distributors for the FFBR were generated by 3D printing. Average liquid film thicknesses of similar to 0.080-0.300 mm and O-2 k(L)a values >10(3) h(-1) were achieved. Liquid film thickness was measured by a novel image analysis method using 4K photography. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is a dynamic manufacturing process that provides new opportunities for creating products with intricate shapes and structures. AM, often known as Three Dimensional (3D) printing, has gained significant attention due to its technological developments, and the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) has further transformed its environment. This work aims to present the role of AI in various AM technologies and their industrial applications, highlighting the evolution of AM from a prototyping tool to standard manufacturing technology for final products. This review discusses the different AM technologies such as powder bed fusion (PBF), binder jetting (BJT), directed energy deposition (DED), and fused deposition modelling (FDM). This paper also covers artificial intelligence applications in design, process parameter optimization, quality control, material processing, reprocessing, and recycling. The outcomes reveal that the utilization of techniques like data acquisition coupled with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms is a foundational element bridging AM and AI. In addition, this review also addresses current challenges related to AI's role in advancing the evolution of AM technology while discussing potential areas for future research.

AB Solid waste management reduces pollution, protects public health, conserves ecosystems, and promotes recycling and circular economies in a sustainable manner. This study analyzes the pollution issues caused by inefficient solid waste management in urban areas, highlighting its negative impact on the environment. In this vein, the T5R-bot collection robot was developed, designed through 3D printing and implemented with an artificial vision model for object detection based on the single shot multibox detector (SSD) and the MobileNetV2 neural network architecture. This system allows for the autonomous identification and collection of up to 12 types of debris, achieving an accuracy of 98% and a mAP of 97.81%. The methodology included the mechanical design of the robot with a rocker-bogie mechanism, ultrasonic sensors for navigation, and a robotic arm with four degrees of freedom. The model was trained with a dataset collected from 2890 images, demonstrating high efficiency in detecting and collecting waste in contaminated environments in public areas. The results confirm the viability of the robot as a tool for improving solid waste management. In addition, the future integration of segregation and adaptive learning capabilities is proposed.

AB The building materials industry ranks among China's most challenging sectors for carbon emission reduction, and achieving its carbon peak and neutrality is critical to advancing the national "dual-carbon strategy". This study systematically reviews the development status and challenges of carbon reduction technology pathways in this industry, with a particular focus on cement sector, from a technological, economic, and environmental perspective, aiming to provide a holistic understanding of current landscapes and future prospects. Key technology pathways analyzed include energy efficiency improvement, clinker factor reduction, raw/fuel materials substitution, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), "low-carbon+digital" operational transformation, development of new functional additives, and green intelligent construction technologies (e.g., 3D printing). Assessments reveal that while some pathways hold significant carbon reduction potential, they face core barriers such as high initial investment, immature industrial chains, low market acceptance, and limited material performance. Moving forward, policy incentives, business model innovation, and AI empowerment are expected to accelerate large-scale adoption of these technologies, driving the building materials industry toward green, low-carbon, and recycling development.

In this study, we propose a green synthesis of bio-based materials with dual antibacterial properties by photopolymerization. Two new methacrylate-based hydroxyanthraquinones derived from purpurin and alizarin (P-3Ac and Al-2Ac) have been designed to promote the polymerization of bio-based vegetable oil and terpene blend mixtures under visible-light irradiation up to 470 nm. All the photochemical mechanisms involved in the photopolymerization processes have been described by steady state photolysis, electron spin resonance spin-trapping (ESR ST) and real-time Fourier transform infrared (RT-FTIR) spectroscopy. Interestingly, the photo-initiating properties of P-3Ac and Al-2Ac are greatly enhanced in comparison with the native unmodified purpurin and alizarin. Polymerization of soybean oil acrylate and linalool through a thiol-ene process has led to the formation of photoactive bio-based materials able to generate biocide reactive oxygen species (ROS) upon light exposure which can also be used as contact-killing materials for tremendous inhibition of bacterial growth. The respective effects of each biocide agent (ROS and linalool) were compared and combined, highlighting stunning inhibition properties of the materials (higher than 99.99%) against both E. coli (Gram negative) and S. aureus (Gram positive), even after a second antibacterial recycling test. Prior to photo-printing experiments, rheological studies have been performed to design greener 3D-photoinduced materials. According to the high bio-renewable carbon contents of the photosensitive P-3Ac-based formulation and its great processability, 3D objects have been designed using Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology upon 405 nm light emitting diode exposure.

AB In this work, novel catalytic microflow reactors prepared by 3D printing and based on polylactic acid (PLA), a compostable biopolymer of relevant industrial interest, were developed. To maintain the properties of the polymer bulk, the metal catalyst, namely palladium (Pd), was deposited in the form of nanoclusters on the surface of the inner walls of the microreactor. A functionalization reaction, i.e. aminolysis, was carried out to activate the channel surface to the metal precursor. The catalyst deposition approach, carried out in water, allowed obtaining a homogeneous distribution of Pd clusters with average dimensions of ca. 20 nm. Hydroge-nation reactions performed in a batch system, using reactor sections, superficially decorated with Pd nano-clusters, demonstrated the excellent activity of the system and the absence of the catalyst leaching. In order to prove the effectiveness of the catalytic system under flow conditions, the elimination of the propargyloxy pro-tecting group from Proc-4-methoxybenzylamine was performed using the activated microflow reactor. The higher catalytic activity, observed under flow conditions compared to a batch system, demonstrated the effec-tiveness of this configuration. Finally, the developed catalytic microreactor was shown to maintain the same degradation behavior as the neat material and to be easily recyclable.

ID POROUS MATERIAL
AB This study investigates the development and acoustic performance of a layered composite structure composed of plastic microfibre pulp (PMFP) and plastic acoustic metamaterial (PAM), designed for low-frequency sound wave control. Addressing the dual challenge of reducing plastic waste and enhancing low-frequency sound absorption, the research explores the use of recycled plastic materials in innovative acoustic applications. PMFP was tested in various thicknesses, while PAM resonators were 3D-printed with adjustable neck lengths and diameters to achieve optimal sound absorption characteristics. The acoustic performance of the composite materials was evaluated in an impedance tube according to ISO 10534-2 for their sound-absorbing properties. Results showed that with increasing thickness of the PMFP sound, absorption peaks shifted to the lower frequencies, with 50 mm thick samples exhibiting a peak absorption coefficient of 0.74 at 500 Hz. When combined with PAM, the structure's effectiveness increased significantly, with the best-performing configuration (PAM with a 4.5 mm neck diameter and 3.0 mm neck length) achieving a highest absorption coefficient of 0.93 at 1250 Hz. Moreover, introducing air gaps behind the composite material further enhanced low-frequency absorption, with a 50 mm air gap shifting the peak sound absorption to 315 Hz, reaching a coefficient of 0.87. The study concludes that the layered composite structure, with recycled plastic waste, provides an effective and environmentally sustainable solution for low-frequency sound absorption. This makes it suitable for use in various industrial and environmental noise control applications, offering an innovative approach to control noise in indoor areas while addressing plastic waste concerns.

AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) is, undoubtedly, one of the most promising and potentially disruptive technologies of the Industry 4.0 era, able to transform the traditional manufacturing paradigm and fuel the generally accepted and necessary shift towards the conceptualisation, design and adoption of sustainable and circular business models. The objective of this paper is to contribute to the structure of the scientific field residing in the intersection of AM and Circular Economy (CE), by determining the status of its current state-of-the-art, proposing an initial typology in an attempt to contribute to the existing efforts of structuring this rather novice research area and pinpointing research gaps where more focus should be put, and highlighting areas with a significant potential for added-value future research. To that end, a sample of 206 papers, published from 2014 to 2020, was retrieved from the Scopus and Google Scholar databases. After studying and critically evaluating their content in full, contributions were classified into six thematic categories, providing a first typology of the current literature, followed by a detailed section highlighting and taxonomizing existing review studies. Next, contributions of the three categories of interest are discussed followed by a critical evaluation of the study's contribution, inherent limitations and future research potential.

AB Since graphene is a type of 2D carbon material with excellent mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties, the efficient preparation of graphene macroscopic assemblies is significant in the potentially large-scale application of graphene sheets. Conventional preparation methods of graphene macroscopic assemblies need strict conditions, and, once formed, the assemblies cannot be edited, reshaped, or recycled. Herein, inspired by the biomineralization process, a feasible approach of shapeable, multimanipulatable, and recyclable gel-like composite consisting of graphene oxide/poly(acrylic acid)/amorphous calcium carbonate (GO-PAA-ACC) is designed. This GO-PAA-ACC material can be facilely synthesized at room temperature with a cross-linking network structure formed during the preparation process. Remarkably, it is stretchable, malleable, self-healable, and easy to process in the wet state, but tough and rigid in the dried state. In addition, these two states can be readily switched by adjusting the water content, which shows recyclability and can be used for 3D printing to form varied architectures. Furthermore, GO-PAA-ACC can be functionalized or processed to meet a variety of specific application requirements (e.g., energy-storage, actuators). The preparation method of GO-PAA-ACC composite in this work also provides a novel strategy for the versatile macroscopic assembly of other materials, which is low-cost, efficient, and convenient for broad application.

AB Circular economy (CE) has emerged as a widely-recognized and vital paradigm across multiple sectors of the construction industry. Considering the complexity of ballasted and ballastless railway tracks, CE has remarkable potential to be employed throughout their whole lifecycle towards sustainability. This review paper examines the implementation of CE based on 10R principles-refute, rethink, reduce, reuse, repair, refurbish, remanufacture, repurpose, recycle, and recover-on all components of substructure and superstructure of ballasted and ballastless railway tracks, covering the potential applications from design and construction to maintenance and endof-life stages. In this context, promotion of CE in railway infrastructure can be achieved not only by enhancing the use of recycled materials and byproducts during the construction and maintenance stages, but also by leveraging digital information technologies. Tools such as material passport, 3D printing, and virtual reality, will further facilitate the implementation of CE principles from the earlier stages of the design lifecycle. Moreover, the state-of-the-art inspection technologies based on the remote sensing and Internet of things (IoT) can be employed to extend the lifespan of track components and apply optimized preventive maintenance activities based on asneeded repairs. In this context, digital platforms like geographical information system (GIS), building information model (BIM), and digital twin, enable the employment of these advanced technologies for promotion of CE based on 10R principles. The characterized strategies will pave the route to Net Zero by 2050 by involvement in the reduction of material quantities from design and construction efficiencies towards changing inspection and maintenance activities, highlighting reduction of CO2 intensity.

AB Bioplastics and biocomposites are eco-friendly alternatives to their petrochemical derived commodity material, but tend to have inferior mechanical and thermal properties. In this work, short-fiber self-reinforced bioplastic composites (SRBCs) have been developed that seek to overcome some of these shortcomings. The SRBCs leverage melt-spun drawn poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) fibers with axially-oriented crystalline structures that exhibit a approximate to 6.7 degrees C higher melt temperature than the same PHBV in isotropic form. This enables a controlled-temperature compounding process that preserves the crystalline structure of the fibers without distortion and ensures uniform distribution within the matrix. The resultant composites display a approximate to 35% increase in ultimate tensile strength and a approximate to 55% increase in impact resistance compared to neat PHBV polymer. This monolithic-type composite system, characterized by high interfacial compatibility and strong fiber-matrix adhesion, also supports high-value recycling while preserving its mechanical properties across multiple lifecycle uses. By focusing upon discontinuous short fiber reinforcement, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for scaling SRBCs through commodity application pathways such as injection molding, compression molding, and 3D printing.

AB Glass has served as a cornerstone of modern civilization due to its exceptional optical transparency and structural integrity. Yet, its static covalent/ionic network fundamentally restricts environmental adaptability, presenting a critical challenge for next-generation sustainable technologies. Here, we report a programmable, bio-derived noncovalent glass (BNG) engineered through multivalent, reconfigurable H-bonding networks composed of natural building blocks (e.g., amino acids, peptides, biomacromolecules) and organic acids with multiple H-bond donors and acceptors. Molecular programming of these networks enables unprecedented four-dimensional control: hydration-tunable mechanical stiffness, amino acid-guided refractive index modulation, humidity/temperature-activated self-healing, and closed-loop aqueous recyclability. This molecularly encoded programmability distinguishes BNG from conventional smart materials, which typically rely on single stimulus-response modes. Critically, the configurability of H-bonding network further endows BNG with versatile processability (e.g., 3D printing, thermal pressing, and mold-casting) for functional architectures. Moreover, the programmable disassembly allows seamless integration into transient electronics as an energy-efficient alternative to energy-intensive glass recycling. By leveraging naturally abundant, metabolically benign building blocks, BNG establishes a sustainable paradigm for adaptive soft electronics and circular packaging-transforming glass from a passive structural medium to a dynamically programmable material.

AB PurposeThis study aims to propose the reuse of PA12 (powder) in another AM process, binder jettiinng, which is less sensitive to the chemical and mechanical degradation of the powder after multiple cycles in the laser system.Design/methodology/approachThe experimental process for evaluating the reuse of SLS powders in a subsequent binder jetting process consists of four phases: powder characterization, bonding analysis, mixture testing and mixture characteristics. Analyses were carried out using techniques such as Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and stress-strain tests for tension and compression. The surface roughness, color, hardness and density of the new mixture were also determined to find physical characteristics. A Taguchi design L8 was used to search for a mixture with the best mechanical strength.FindingsThe results indicated that the integration of waste powder PA12 with calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CSH) generates appropriate particle distribution with rounded particles of PA12 that improve powder flowability. The micropores observed with less than 60 mu m, facilitated binder and infiltrant penetration on 3D parts. The 60/40 (CSH-PA12) mixture with epoxy resin postprocessing was found to be the best-bonded mixture in mechanical testing, rugosity and hardness results. The new CSH-PA12 mixture resulted lighter and stronger than the CSH powder commonly used in binder jetting technology.Originality/valueThis study adds value to the polymer powder bed fusion process by using its waste in a circular process. The novel reuse of PA12 waste in an established process was achieved in an accessible and economical manner.

AB Background Training is an essential aspect of providing high-quality treatment and ensuring patient safety in any medical practice. Because extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a complicated operation with various elements, variables, and irregular situations, doctors must be experienced and knowledgeable about all conventional protocols and emergency procedures. The conventional simulation approach has a number of limitations. The approach is intrinsically costly since it relies on disposable medical equipment (i.e., oxygenators, heat exchangers, and pumps) that must be replaced regularly due to the damage caused by the liquid used to simulate blood. The oxygenator, which oxygenates the blood through a tailored membrane in ECMO, acts as a replacement for the patient's natural lung. For the context of simulation-based training (SBT) oxygenators are often expensive and cannot be recycled owing to contamination issues. Methods Consequently, it is advised that the training process include a simulated version of oxygenators to optimize reusability and decrease training expenses. Toward this goal, this article demonstrates a mock oxygenator for ECMO SBT, designed to precisely replicate the real machine structure and operation. Results The initial model was reproduced using 3D modeling and printing. Additionally, the mock oxygenator could mimic frequent events such as pump noise and clotting. Furthermore, the oxygenator is integrated with the modular ECMO simulator using cloud-based communication technology that goes in hand with the internet of things technology to provide remote control via an instructor tablet application. Conclusions The final 3D modeled oxygenator body was tested and integrated with the other simulation modules at Hamad Medical Corporation with several participants to evaluate the effectiveness of the training session.

AB The negative impacts of cement-based material (CBM) production are way bigger than ever expected. To illustrate the scale of this phenomenon, all the forests in the world, regardless of the fact that they are disappearing at an alarming rate, are not enough to offset even half the environmental impact (EI) of global aggregates and cement production. Thus, it is necessary to promote scientific research and guide more researchers and professionals in the construction industry to investigate the undiscovered sustainability paths, namely for concrete before and after end-of-life. For that purpose, a global and extensive review is made here to provide an overall view of concrete sustainability in all possible paths. Then, each path is organized as follows: (i) brief introduction, (ii) presentation of non-traditional materials and techniques that can be used for the selected strategy, (iii) their limitations and (iv) future trends. The study also identifies what is already known to avoid putting valuable research resources into redundant scientific studies. The following paths of concrete production sustainability were identified: mix composition (e.g. reduce the El and resources use of binders, aggregates, water and reinforcement), materials manufacturing (e.g. new production techniques of cement, aggregates and steel bars), concrete mixing (e.g. mixer type and mixing method), on-site application (e.g. regular casting and digital concrete/3D printing), and in-service performance (e.g. increase the durability of reinforced concrete and carbon capture and thermal conductivity). On most of these paths, many studies have been made on the same non-traditional materials and techniques and similar outputs were obtained. Yet, many other nontraditional materials and techniques have not been explored before, or are incomplete in terms of the characteristics analysed. More than providing definite solutions, this contribution intends to open the minds of the readers to the vastly unexplored world of "green concrete". (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

DE bio-based textiles; natural dyes; zero waste design; design for
   disassembly; circular economy
AB Significant strategies persist in the context of the current European growth strategies toward sustainability through the digital transformation of the fashion industry. For instance, the industrial dyeing processes pose environmental and health risks, blend textiles are difficult to recycle at the end of life, and the "cut-and-sew" methodology of clothing assembly determines significant pre-consumer textile waste. Therefore, this study presents a case study based on a design-driven approach that encompasses circular strategies, such as zero-waste design, design for disassembly (DfD), and the use of bio-based textiles and natural dyes extracted from plants toward sustainability and circularity. The research focuses on natural dyes as a sustainable alternative to the current industrial and chemistry-based processes. However, current academic and industrial experiments face several hurdles, including color fastness and production scalability. Technological advancements, such as 3D digital tools, new dyeing technologies, and an integrated systemic and interoperable approach in the supply and value chain could empower the transition toward sustainable dyeing practices. The results of this study aim to harness the potential of natural dyes on bio-based and semi-synthetic textiles, reporting (i) the experimental results that enhance dyeing stability and expand the color spectrum, (ii) the design strategies such as zero-waste design, 3D digital design, and engineered printing techniques that reduce waste during dyeing, prototyping, and manufacturing stage, and (iii) a systemic circular model involving diverse supply chain partners, to extend garment lifetimes through customization and user engagement.

AB Recycling precious metals from electronic wastes, minerals, waste catalysts, industrial wastewater and other wastes are of great significance to the construction of a sustainable industry framework, but it is still challenging. Herein, we for the first time proposed the design and preparation of two three-dimensional (3D) WS(2 )nanobowls hybrid aerogels (GA@WS2 Nbs and WS2 Nbs/GA) for the recovery of precious metal ions and highly efficient removal of organic dyes. The construction of tungsten disulfide nanobowls (WS2 Nbs) was optimized in morphology in consideration of the precursor concentration and reaction time. The prepared WS2 Nbs/GA was shown to rapidly capture Au(III) from printed wiring board (PWB) containing various interferents. The calculated capture capability of 1265.8 mg g(-1) for Au(III) was obtained. It surprisingly involved that the deposition of nano gold (Au0) on the WS2 Nbs/GA was due to not only the selective chemistry of WS2 Nbs/GA but also its reduction interaction. Furthermore, the WS2 Nbs/GA exhibited remarkable efficiencies (99 %) in the removal of methylene blue. The unique properties gave the hybrid aerogels gifted ability in capturing Au(III) from electronic wastes and minerals. It provided a blueprint for the next generation green platform for precious metals and water treatment.

AB Flexible and weavable metal-organic framework (MOF)-based hybrid fibers can enable many potential applications, particularly for wearable functional devices. However, the fabrication of composite textiles with high MOF loadings, a large specific surface area, and outstanding mechanical flexibility is still very challenging. Herein, we demonstrate the preparation of mechanically strong MOF@ANF (aramid nanofiber) hybrid aerogel fibers with gradient distribution of MOF crystals along the radial direction through in situ growth of MOFs on the skeletons of three-dimensional (3D)-printed aramid nanofiber (ANF) aerogel fibers. The deprotonation of poly-(p-phenylene terephthalamide) networks increases the local concentration of cobalt ions and enables the in situ growth of MOF crystals inside the ANF filaments, the mechanism of which was revealed by computational simulations. As a result, an ultrahigh ZIF-67 loading of 63.4 wt % and a large specific surface area of 756.6 m(2) g(-1) were achieved by the hybrid ZIF-67@ANF aerogel fibers, the highest specific surface area among macroscopic and weavable MOF-based composite fibers ever reported. These aerogel textiles show excellent mechanical flexibility and exhibit fast adsorption kinetics, high adsorption capacity, and recycling stability for addressing various hazardous pollutants, including formaldehyde vapor, heavy metal ions, and organic dyes. This work takes a further step toward wearable-MOF-based textile development for broad applications in wearable devices.

AB Green facade systems (GFS) are a growingly popular resource in climate adaptation. However, current GFS are characterized mainly by high costs, high embodied carbon and short life span materials. This study presents the early-stage design of a cost-effective and low-embodied carbon GFS prototype. This prototype was developed and tested with a research through design (RTD) methodology. The first RTD iteration dealt with cost-effectiveness and low-embodied carbon and categorized the prototypes into three main GFS design typologies: facade-based typology, bal-cony forest typology, and the redesign of a GFS patented facade-based product. In iteration 2, the designs produced in iteration 1 were evaluated through a life cycle and cost analysis of the three typologies and the existing designs were refined. Finally, in iteration 3, the hydrological and structural performance was tested as a 3D printed GFS mock-up. This process resulted in a modu-lar, cost-effective and low-embodied carbon early-stage GFS prototype. It was found that the se-lected materials (recycled), plants, substrate (with high-water holding capacity), GFS typology (facade-based with a light structure) and its fixing system (modular) lowered the costs and the embodied carbon of the GFS prototype by comparison to other GFS products.

AB Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a powerful tool to evaluate the environmental impacts of any domestic or industrial activity consuming goods and services. There has been an increasing interest in recycling polymers and polymer composites for circular economy and sustainability; however, the widespread use of polymers should be avoided upfront, especially for research and development. LCA is performed to evaluate the environmental impact of two characterization approaches (numerical modeling and experimentation) used for additively manufactured polymers and composites. The current study was conducted using GaBi software, per the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 14040 and 14044 guidelines. Five different environmental impacts, namely global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), ozone layer depletion (ODP), and fossil fuel depletion (FFD), were evaluated and compared for numerical modeling and experimental characterization approaches. Electrical energy used during the filament fabrication, 3DP process, and mechanical testing was identified as a hotspot in the environmental impacts (GWP, AP, EP, and FFD) for experimental design. However, the materials consumed during the experimental characterization contributed considerably to ODP. Results concluded that using the numerical modeling approach could significantly reduce the environmental impact caused due to extensive resource utilization in experiments. The numerical modeling approach can help promote sustainability as these tools can adequately predict the response of 3D-printed structures; therefore, they should be explored and improved further.

AB Grinding is a manufacturing process which significantly contributes in producing high precision and durable components required in numerous applications such as aerospace, defence and automobiles. This review article is focused to uncover history, witness the present and predict the future of the grinding process. While going through the literature, it has been observed that minimal work has been done in explaining the history, present status and future scopes of the grinding process. In this era of information and environmental awareness, sustainability aspects have become a primary concern of almost every research field. In the grinding process too, the research work includes ecological elements such as reducing the consumption of cutting fluids through minimum quantity lubrication, utilizing cryogenics, hybrid lubrication and cooling techniques that are still required to be explored critically. Further, some significant findings of the prevailing research in grinding include modification in grinding wheel surface, merging different grinding principles such as usages of the textured grinding wheel, ultrasonic grinding, 3D printing of grinding wheel and artificial intelligence in grinding are also presented. Another unascertained problem is the management of grinding swarf, which is being attended to by recycling it to fabricate composites which is expected to be another prominent domain of research. Further, the advancements taking place exhibit the potential of the grinding process, suggesting that its future is bright and ever-growing.

AB The interest of this study lies in the fact that the transition from a linear to a circular economy is of key interest in relevant business and academic fields, although the circular economy is an emerging issue and theoretical and empirical research has been limited until recently. However, circular business models are receiving more and more attention, and it is therefore strategically necessary to develop tools that facilitate their implementation. Therefore, because of increasing interest amongst research in the circular economy and sustainability, the purpose of the present study and its strength lies in the systematic presentation of both of these specific academic streams. The approach was qualitative and based on a systematic literature review. We examined several areas in which the circular economy has a place. We highlight sustainability, consumer behaviour, innovation, remanufacturing, operations management, supply chains, intellectual capital, 3D printing, big data, and recycling. We also consider drivers, challenges, the relationship between circular economy and small to medium-sized enterprises, and the influence of circular economy in specific sectors such as textiles and food. It is hoped that the study will facilitate a possible sustainable solution that contrasts with the current linear model of production and resource management. The circular economy has the potential to create positive synergies in economic, social, and environmental areas, despite its recent origin.

AB The durability and degradation of polymers is very important for product design in terms of material choice. The degradation behavior of two biodegradable thermoplastic materials manufactured by 3D printing, Enviro ABS and PLA, was studied. The action of the sun and seawater was simulated to find out how they affect the properties of these materials over a period of 8 weeks. The yield strength, maximum elongation, ultimate tensile strength, and microscopy were analyzed, as well as dimensions and mass changes. These biodegradable materials were studied to conclude whether there is an environmentally friendly alternative to traditional ABS, being one of the most widely used petroleum-based plastics in industry and in fused deposition modeling (FDM) or fused filament fabrication (FFF). PLA showed a weight loss and increase in ultimate tensile stress on degradation by sunlight and a prolonged decrease in ultimate tensile stress on degradation by seawater due to humidity absorption. In contrast, Enviro ABS does not show a noticeable difference between the beginning and the end of the test, which leads to the conclusion that Enviro ABS is a good alternative to conventional ABS without forgetting the environmental effects that are currently involved in the manufacture, recycling and composting of this type of material.

AB The valorisation of keratinous wastes involves biorefining and recovering the bioresource materials from the keratinous wastes to produce value-added keratin-based bioproducts with a broad application, distribution, and marketability potential. Valorisation of keratinous wastes increases the value of the wastes and enables more sustainable waste management towards a circular bioeconomy. The abundance of keratinous wastes as feedstock from agro-industrial processing, wool processing, and grooming industry benefits biorefinery and extraction of keratins, which could be the optimal solution for developing an ecologically and economically sustainable keratin-based economy. The transition from the current traditional linear models that are deleterious to the environment, which end energy and resources recovery through disposal by incineration and landfilling, to a more sustainable and closed-loop recycling and recovery approach that minimises pollution, disposal challenges, loss of valuable bioresources and potential revenues are required. The paper provides an overview of keratinous wastes and the compositional keratin proteins with the descriptions of the various keratin extraction methods in biorefinery and functional material synthesis, including enzymatic and microbial hydrolysis, chemical hydrolysis (acid/alkaline hydrolysis, dissolution in ionic liquids, oxidative and sulphitolysis) and chemical-free hydrolysis (steam explosion and ultrasonic). The study describes various uses and applications of keratinases and keratin -based composites fabricated through various manufacturing processes such as lyophilisation, compression moulding, solvent casting, hydrogel fabrication, sponge formation, electrospinning, and 3D printing for value-added applications.

AB Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) ash, a by-product of fluidized bed coal-fired sulfur fixation technology, presents an opportunity for recycling and reuse when employed as a supplementary cementitious material in cement composite systems, thereby alleviating environmental pressure. Meanwhile, the rheological characteristics of cement pastes are crucial for optimizing its workability, facilitating diverse engineering applications such as pumping, formwork pressure calculation, and 3D printing. Against this backdrop, this study systematically explores the impact of CFBC ash, varying in particle size and content, on the rheological properties of Portland cement (PC) paste. Findings reveal that elevated CFBC content correlates with heightened yield stress and viscosity of the paste, with the paste incorporating 40% CFBC ash having the highest yield stress of 71.6 Pa. Furthermore, incorporating CFBC with finer particle size distribution amplifies these rheological parameters. Thixotropy mirrors the alterations in dynamic yield stress and viscosity, indicating that CFBC ash addition enhances paste thixotropy. In PC-CFBC ash composites, G' values consistently surpass G", suggesting early-stage elasticity during oscillation testing. Thixotropy in PC-CFBC ash composites is intricately linked to superplasticizer adsorption capacity, while viscoelastic evolution of the paste is governed by hydration kinetics.

AB Many polymers, including polyethylene, feature a relatively low melting point and hence must be cross-linked to make them viable for applications that demand a high stiffness and creep resistance at elevated temperatures. The resulting thermoset plastics cannot be recycled, and therefore alternative materials with a reconfigurable internal network structure are in high demand. Here, we establish that such a thermoset-like yet recyclable material can be realized through the addition of a nanocellulose reinforcing agent. A network consisting of cellulose nanocrystals, nano- or microfibrils imparts many of the characteristics that are usually achieved through chemical cross-linking. For instance, the addition of only 7.5 wt % of either nanocellulose material significantly enhances the melt stiffness of an otherwise molten ethylene-acrylate copolymer by at least 1 order of magnitude. At the same time, the nanocellulose network reduces the melt creep elongation to less than 10%, whereas the neat molten matrix would rupture. At high shear rates, however, the molten composites do not display a significantly higher viscosity than the copolymer matrix, and therefore retain the processability of a thermoplastic material. Repeated re-extrusion at 140 degrees C does not compromise the thermomechanical properties, which indicates a high degree of recyclability. The versatility of dynamic nanocellulose networks is illustrated by 3D printing of a cellulose composite, where the high melt stiffness improves the printability of the resin.

TI Kinetics of Catalyzed Thermal Degradation of Polylactide and Its

AB Comprehensive Summary Polylactide (PLA) is an outstanding sacrificial template material for the manufacture of microchannels in a thermosetting matrix. However, the initial thermal degradation temperature of pure PLA is relatively high (about 280 degrees C), which limits its use as a sacrificial template. In this report, we found that TBD, an organic base catalyst, can significantly reduce the thermal degradation temperature of PLA. TBD has higher catalytic activity for the thermal degradation of PLA compared with Tin(II) oxalate (Sn(Oxa)), one catalyst reported in the literature. Moreover, the gaseous products catalyzed by TBD for PLA thermal degradation are mainly lactide, and the formation temperature of the monomer is lower and the yield is higher, which may have potential value for PLA recycling. A combined catalyst, S8T2, was composed of 80% low activity catalyst Sn(Oxa) and 20% high activity catalyst TBD, which can catalyze the rapid degradation of PLA without greatly damaging the mechanical properties of PLA. PLA-S8T2 sacrificial fibers can form high-precision one-dimensional microchannels in the epoxy resin matrix, and 3D-printed PLA-S8T2 sacrificial templates can be used to form three-dimensional microchannels in a thermosetting matrix by vaporization of sacrificial components process (VaSC). These features highlight the great potential of PLA-S8T2 as sacrificial template material for the preparation of the complicated microchannels in the thermosetting matrix.

AB In this study, we investigated the performance improvement caused by the addition of copper (Cu) nanoparticles to high-density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix material. Composite materials, with filler percentages of 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, and 10.0 wt% were synthesized through the material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing technique. The synthesized nanocomposite filaments were utilized for the manufacturing of specimens suitable for the experimental procedure that followed. Hence, we were able to systematically investigate their tensile, flexural, impact, and microhardness properties through various mechanical tests that were conducted according to the corresponding standards. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy was used to investigate the electrical/dielectric properties of the composites. Moreover, by employing means of Raman spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) we were also able to further investigate their vibrational, structural, and thermal properties. Concomitantly, means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), as well as atomic force microscopy (AFM), were used for the examination of the morphological and structural characteristics of the synthesized specimens, while energy-dispersive Xray spectroscopy (EDS) was also performed in order to receive a more detailed picture on the structural characteristics of the various synthesized composites. The corresponding nanomaterials were also assessed for their antibacterial properties regarding Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) with the assistance of a method named screening agar well diffusion. The results showed that the mechanical properties of HDPE benefited from the utilization of Cu as a filler, as they showed a notable improvement. The specimen of HDPE/Cu 4.0 wt% was the one that presented the highest levels of reinforcement in four out of the seven tested mechanical properties (for example, it exhibited a 36.7% improvement in the flexural strength, compared to the pure matrix). At the same time, the nano- composites were efficient against the S. aureus bacterium and less efficient against the E. coli bacterium. The use of such multi-functional, robust nanocomposites in MEX 3D printing is positively impacting applications in various fields, most notably in the defense and security sectors. The latter becomes increasingly important if one takes into account that most firearms encompass various polymeric parts that require robustness and improved mechanical properties, while at the same time keeping the risk of spreading various infectious microorganisms at a bare minimum.

AB Interest in the sustainable materials sector is growing and accelerated. These materials are designed to reduce the use of non-renewable resources, limit greenhouse gas emissions, and be recyclable or biodegradable, making them highly attractive to both academia and industry. Constantly updating on innovations in this field is essential to speed up the transition to a circular economy and significantly reduce environmental impact. The paper analyzes the current status and future trends of the scientific literature for seven sustainability-related materials categories, such as sustainable materials, green materials, biomaterials, eco-friendly materials, alternative materials, material recycling and material recovery from complex products, and sustainable applied materials. Next, it assesses the impacts, benefits, and challenges associated with sustainable materials from the scientific literature according to six research fields (impact on the environment, performance and durability, economic efficiency, health and safety, social sustainability, and implementation and use). Furthermore, the paper outlines recent advances in sustainable material design, including biomimicry, nanotechnology, additive manufacturing, 3D printing, and sustainable composite materials. Additionally, a bibliometric analysis of 545 studies on sustainable materials published between 1999 and 2023 was conducted based on eight criteria, namely trend, source, author, country, keywords, thematic, co-citation, and content. The findings show that the sustainability-related materials categories have a particular distribution among the domains. Also, the thematic map analysis outlines that biopolymers, nanocellulose, and biocomposites are critical research areas for developing sustainable materials.

AB Mars exploration has a history of more than half a century and has been the subject of numerous expeditions over the past nearly 70 years. Much of this exploration has been motivated by the idea of colonizing the planet. Providing energy to a Martian colony is a challenging task due to the challenging conditions and the need for special equipment. There are a number of options for supplying energy to a colony, with nuclear, solar, geothermal and wind all being explored. Solar and nuclear energy have the greatest potential, and our research is looking at how these energy sources could power the colony.
   In our research, we calculated the energy use of a potential Martian colony and combined these to assess the potential for generating the demand we estimated. We have calculated the oxygen demand and its production, and we have investigated the theoretical possibility of a new process for waste management to produce recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for 3D printing. We have also calculated the gamma irradiation dose of Martian samples and the energy requirements of the equipment needed to produce it, the extraction of water and its application in agriculture. We also evaluated the potential of nuclear reactors and solar energy. Our calculations provide a good basis for a full simulation of the energy system of a Martian colony.

AB Non-degradable materials are responsible for a variety of negative socio-environmental effects. In order to realize a sustainable bioeconomy a circular design of production systems based on biogenic resources is inevitable. Consequently, the recycling of residual and side-streams is becoming increasingly relevant. In this paper, we investigate the potential of using sterilized mycelium from Aspergillus niger, which occurs as a residual-product from the citric acid production, as a sustainable material for additive biomanufacturing by using the Liquid Deposition Modeling technology. The mycelium-based material is extruded through a specially designed printer head, enabling a multi-layered fabrication of complex structures. In combination with additives such as fibers the mycelium can lead to materials with promising mechanical characteristics and shows good properties for its use as an innovative material to be applied in additive manufacturing processes. We conclude that additive biomanufacturing with mycelium from Aspergillus is a sustainable alternative for traditional materials. Its biodegradability characteristic makes it a promising material for various applications and circular products. Finally, we outline further research and development issues to enable the transformation into industrial applications. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Polyolefins are the most widely used and produced petroleum-based plastics. Unfortunately, the enormous production and usage of traditional polyolefins, coupled with the lack of effective disposal or recycling options, have led to significant fossil fuel depletion and severe environmental pollution. To foster sustainable societal development, there is an urgent need to design high-performance and inherently recyclable polyolefin-like bio-derived materials by innovative structural and molecular designs. Here, inspired by a copolymerization molecular design approach that simultaneously confers recyclability and superior properties to materials, high-performance recyclable polyolefin-like bio-derived polyesters (PBCxS) enabled by a novel judicious combination of building blocks are reported. PBCxS display excellent mechanical (40.6 MPa, 498.4%) and gas barrier properties (O2 0.09 barrer, H2O 1.70 x 10-13 g cm cm-2 s-1 Pa-1), even greater than those of bio-based materials and most aliphatic polyester. Meanwhile, PBCxS also exhibit multifunctionality with excellent biocompatibility properties and ultra-high processability (thermoforming, extrusion spinning, and 3D printing processing). Notably, PBCxS undergo depolymerization in the absence of any additional organic solvents, regenerating 92.0% of the high-purity (98.3%) original monomers, even with polyolefin blend plastics. Repolymerized polyesters still maintain their exceptional mechanical and thermal qualities. The successful application of this approach in polyesters opens up exciting possibilities for designing high-performance and recyclable bio-derived polyolefin-like materials.

AB Some of the primary barriers to widespread adoption of metal additive manufacturing (AM) are persistent defect formation in built components, high material costs, and lack of consistency in powder feedstock. To generate more reliable, complex-shaped metal parts, it is crucial to understand how feedstock properties change with reuse and how that affects build mechanical performance. Powder particles interacting with the energy source, yet not consolidated into an AM part can undergo a range of dynamic thermal interactions, resulting in variable particle behavior if reused. In this work, we present a systematic study of 316L powder properties from the virgin state through thirty powder reuses in the laser powder bed fusion process. Thirteen powder characteristics and the resulting AM build mechanical properties were investigated for both powder states. Results show greater variability in part ductility for the virgin state. The feedstock exhibited minor changes to size distribution, bulk composition, and hardness with reuse, but significant changes to particle morphology, microstructure, magnetic properties, surface composition, and oxide thickness. Additionally, sieved powder, along with resulting fume/ condensate and recoil ejecta (spatter) properties were characterized. Formation mechanisms are proposed. It was discovered that spatter leads to formation of single crystal ferrite through large degrees of supercooling and massive solidification. Ferrite content and consequently magnetic susceptibility of the powder also increases with reuse, suggesting potential for magnetic separation as a refining technique for altered feedstock.

AB Ecotoxicological analysis of construction products is a relatively unexplored area at international level. Aquatic toxicity tests on construction products has been recommended recently for freshwater environment. However, the biological effects of alternative materials on marine ecosystem are still not considered. In this study, the main aim was to assess the environmental impact of alternative mortars proposed as artificial reefs (ARs) materials. The ARs specimens were developed by 3D printing, based on cement and geopolymer mortars using recycled sands of glass and seashells. For this purpose, a leaching test and two different toxicity bioassays, luminosity reduction of marine bacteria Vibrio fischeri (Microtox (R)) and the success of embryo-larval development of sea -urchin Paracentrotus lividus, were conducted. From the leaching results it should be noted that the mobility of all trace elements considered in both, raw materials and mortars, meet the inert landfill limits, except As, Mo, Se or Sb in the leachates geopolymer mortars. However, the results obtained from the both bioassays show low environmental acceptability for those mortars containing shell sand, probably due to the degradation of the organic matter adhered to the shells. On the other hand, cement mortars obtain better results than geopolymer mortars, regardless of the aggregate used, showing certain consistency with the leaching behaviour, since they present the lowest mobility of trace chemical elements. Therefore, the results supporting the environmental acceptability of its potential use as alternative materials in the production of ARs.

AB In this study, silica in the form of raw local natural sand was added to high-density-polyethylene (HDPE) in order to develop a composite material in the form of sheets that could have potential applications in thin film industries, such as packaging, or recycling industries, such as in 3D printing. The silica/HDPE composite sheets were developed using a melt extruder followed by using a hot press for compression molding. The impact of two different particle sizes (25 mu m and 5 mu m) of the silica particles on selected properties such as toughness, elastic modulus, ductility, and composite density were analyzed. A considerable increase in the toughness and elastic modulus was observed from 0 wt% to 20 wt% with a 25 mu m filler size. However, a general decreasing trend was observed in the material's toughness and elastic modulus with decreasing particle size. A similar trend was observed for the ductility and the tensile strength of the sheets prepared from both filler particle sizes. In terms of the composite density, as the filler was increased from 20 wt% to 50 wt%, an increase in the composite densities was noticed for both particle sizes. Additionally, the sheets developed with 25 mu m particle size had a slightly higher density than the 5 mu m particle size, which is expected as the size can account for the higher weight. Results from this work aim to analyze the use of local sand as a filler material that can contribute towards maximizing the potential of such composite materials developed in extrusion industries.

AB Recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) is recognized as an environmentally friendly construction material derived from reclaimed concrete components. This paper aims to conduct a comprehensive scientometric analysis of RAC research published between 2000 and 2023 in the Web of Science core database. The study includes analyses of publication trends over time, contributions and collaborations among authors, productivity of institutions and countries, co-citation networks, and keyword co-occurrence patterns. Additionally, the research identifies emerging frontiers in RAC studies. The results are visually presented to provide a holistic overview of the current state of RAC research and future developmental trajectories. The study analyzes publication trends over time, with over 80% of the papers published after 2017, reflecting the growing interest in sustainable construction. Key trends identified include the increasing focus on improving the mechanical properties and durability of RAC, microstructural analysis, and innovative manufacturing techniques. While the field has advanced significantly, challenges remain in areas such as the integration of nanoparticles, biomineralization techniques, carbon capture and utilization, and 3D printing technologies.

AB The Jammed Architectural Structures (JAS), presented in this article, are 3D-printed fully reversible architectural elements, composed of low-cost loose bulk material, and string reinforcement. The material system is based on crushed stones (known from the railroad industry) and recycled string. If poured without any containment, the stones naturally form a pile. However, in the case of our JAS, a robotically placed string is applied to confine and transform the bulk material into geometrically differentiated structures at an architectural scale. Since this is a nonstandard material system, a combination of techniques from the fields of architecture and materials science is necessary to, first, understand the material behavior and consequently to inform the processes of design and construction. This article investigates the load-bearing capacities and the deformation of our JAS by presenting results from a series of uniaxial compression tests and fiber-optic measurements. Findings from these tests serve to inform the generative logic of the string layout, which is not only key to the design of our JAS but also responsible for the material properties of the system. The developed methods are validated at an architectural scale through the design and construction of a wall segment loaded with concrete slabs. The presented results prove that the string/stone material system has the potential of becoming an actual load-bearing building material and forms the basis for material-informed design strategies for JAS.

ID DIGITAL FABRICATION
AB Concrete is a highly versatile construction material, not only for the reason that it has excellent properties in terms of structural performance, building physics, availability and price, but also because it can be moulded into virtually any shape regardless of its geometric complexity. However, even though current digital design tools allow to effortlessly design and calculate structures, which are exploiting these properties, this potential remains all too often unrealized. This is due to the fact that geometrically complex concrete structures require expensive, one-of-a kind formwork, which can often not be reused or even recycled. Consequently, the current practice for producing non-standard curvilinear architecture in reinforced concrete is neither ecologically sustainable nor economically feasible for a broader range of architectural typologies. Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes, like 3D printing with concrete, on the other hand, currently struggle with the integration of structural reinforcement, limiting the technique to predominantly compression-loaded applications. This research addresses both issues and proposes Mesh Mould, a robotic fabrication process that unifies concrete formwork and structural reinforcement, and hence potentially reduces formwork waste and construction costs for non-standard reinforced concrete constructions. The development of a fully automated robotic fabrication process involved various research disciplines, including architecture, material science, mechanical engineering, robotics as well as civil engineering. This paper describes the technological developments of the Mesh Mould construction system that were necessary to meet the challenges of 1:1 construction. The results are demonstrated in a final loadbearing structure, the Mesh Mould wall of the DFAB HOUSE on NEST.

AB Backpacks play a pivotal role in facilitating the transportation of essential items, particularly within the realm of physical activities. In demanding physical environments such as mountain sports, effective thermoregulation, pressure absorption, and distribution become paramount due to the repetitive interaction between the athlete's back and the corresponding area of the backpack. Given that the backpack pads serve as a crucial component of this system, acting as the intermediary layer between the human body and the backpack itself, this study delves into the mechanical and thermoregulatory properties of these components. Specifically, it compares a commercially available pad configuration with five lattice structures manufactured using additive manufacturing techniques. These methods include Large-Volume Filament printing, Multi-Jet Fusion, High-Speed Laser Sintering, and Laser Sintering, with an additional post-processing step-smoothening-for the Multi-Jet Fusion pads. All pads are evaluated on both standardized test protocols regarding mechanics, surface roughness, and humidity as well as a biomechanical setup. For continuous measurement during biomechanical testing, a sensor system including pressure, humidity, and temperature sensors is developed. In addition, a thermal camera was used to measure surface temperature at the back. Throughout the biomechanical testing, 20 male athletes performed a 15 min treadmill walk at 5 km/h and an incline of 6 degrees with all pad configurations, wearing a commercially available backpack with an additional 8 kg of mass. The results revealed significant preferences regarding temperature and humidity uptake, backed up by the standardized test procedures. Furthermore, investigations with the customized sensor system show the irrelevance of the damping-improved back plate design. Overall, additively manufactured backpack pads can play a pivotal role in the thermoregulation and personalized design of backpack configurations.

AB As three-dimensional printing (3DP) technology continues to develop, it has successfully prepared rock mass samples repetitively and reproducibly. Previous studies primarily focused on comparing the mechanical properties and the pore structure between 3DP rocklike samples and natural rocks based on traditional uniaxial compression and CT scanning tests at single-stress conditions. In this study, 3DP gypsum samples were prepared for uniaxial compression tests equipped with the high-resolution in situ X-ray micro-computed tomography (Micro-CT) apparatus to obtain two-dimensional (2D) Micro-CT scanning images of 3DP gypsum samples at different stages of deformation. Based on the Micro-CT images, the cracking and pore structure evolution of 3DP gypsum samples were quantitatively analyzed. Results indicate that as the load increases, the void ratio of 3DP gypsum samples first decreases gradually and then increases slowly, which is later followed by a rapid rise along with failure. The cracks could be categorized into three types based on their initiation and growth mechanism: cracks that initiate and grow along the interface (Crack I), pores (Crack II), and residual binders (Crack III). Compared with pores in the compression region, pores were more prone to connect with adjacent pores in the extension region, forming larger pores. The qualitative and quantitative results are essential to characterizing and understanding the failure mechanism and microstructural evolution of 3DP gypsum samples for modeling natural rock behavior.
   3DP technology, with its highly customizable and precisely controllable features, presents an innovative approach for the fabrication of rock analogs. Currently, a topic of considerable debate revolves around the efficacy of utilizing 3DP as a viable replacement for natural rocks. To address this issue, we conducted an investigation into the cracking mechanisms and pore evolution of 3DP rocks under in situ compression experiments. First, we investigated the particle size distribution and composition of ZP150 powder. Subsequently, 3DP gypsum samples were manufactured using the ZPrinter 450 using ZP150 powder and Zb63 binder as the printing materials in this study. By complying with an in situ Micro-CT scanner, we conducted a microscopic investigation of crack behavior and pore evolution in the 3DP gypsum samples during uniaxial compression experiments. Through comprehensive analysis of visualized cracks and pores, a novel failure mode of 3DP gypsum samples under loading was proposed, considering the impacts of pores, bedding planes, and residual binder. The results presented in this study are important for characterizing and understanding the failure mechanism and microstructural evolution of 3DP gypsum samples when modeling natural rock behavior or conducting physical model experiments.

AB This study pioneers a sustainable strategy to convert waste cooking oil (WCO) into multifunctional 4D-printable photocurable pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs), addressing critical challenges in high value-added utilisation of WCO and industrial demand for adaptive, eco-friendly materials. Through sequential epoxidation and esterification, WCO was transformed into epoxy waste oil methacrylate (EWOMA), a photocurable monomer. Blending EWOMA with flexible acrylates - hydroxypropyl acrylate (HPA) or cyclohexyl acrylate (CHA) - yielded two novel PSA systems compatible with LCD 3D printing and conventional coating methods. Optimised formulations of EWOMA-CHA system achieved commercial-level adhesion, with interfacial toughness reaching 499.5 J/m2 (PMMA), 412 J/m2 (glass) and 222.92 J/m2 (steel). Molecular simulations revealed that the inclusion of flexible end-group molecules, particularly CHA, significantly enhanced the polymer network's flexibility and structural adaptability. This optimisation improved the distribution of hydrogen bonding both within the system and at the adhered surface, thereby strengthening adhesion and boosting PSA performance. Beyond adhesion, these PSAs demonstrated exceptional multifunctionality: high flexibility (elongation at break: 162.0% for EWOMA-CHA), thermally induced shape memory (room-temperature deformation/recovery, fixation at -15 degrees C), and biodegradability (11.52% weight lossin 45-day soil burial). As a low-cost, scalable platform, these WCO-based 4D-printable PSAs enable eco-industrial innovation for biomedical, robotics, packaging, and so on.

AB Natural fiber-reinforced thermoplastic composites have gained increasing attention due to their sustainability. Additive manufacturing, particularly Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), enables the fabrication of such composites with complex geometries. This study investigates the mechanical behavior of wood-polylactic acid (PLA) composites fabricated via FDM, focusing on their tensile and fracture properties under different water absorption durations. Results indicate that wood-PLA exhibits reduced tensile strength and stiffness compared to pure PLA. The tensile strength for wood-PLA was 23.4 MPa, which was significantly lower than the strength of the PLA (54.6 MPa). However, the wood-PLA showed enhanced strain energy density in the tensile test, measuring 1.41 times greater than the PLA, and higher energy absorption ability in the Single Edged Notched Bending (SENB) test. Water uptake induced plasticisation effects in the wood-PLA composites, resulting in a 20% reduction in strength and a 10% decrease in elastic modulus after 15 days. Moreover, elongation at break increased by 66%, contributing to a 48% improvement in energy absorption. Notably, these effects are reversible upon redrying, suggesting that water primarily acts as an external plasticizer. The study highlights the mechanical response of wood-PLA composites and provides insights into their structural integrity in humid environments.

AB This work reports the optimization strategy for the design of a microfluidic platform to achieve the separation and recovery of aqueous mixtures of rare earth elements (REEs); the work showcases the separation of dysprosium, neodymium and lanthanum using microextraction modules with an organic phase constituted of Cyanex (R) 572 diluted in Shellsol (R) D70. An optimization model has been developed to assist in the design of the number of stages (microextractors, settling tanks and mixer and splitter units) and the best operational conditions that maximize the separation and recovery targets. Results predicted by the model with a configuration composed of 4 microreactors have been experimentally evaluated. Starting with 1 mM equimolar REE mixtures and 301 mM Cyanex (R) 572 as the organic phase, the model shows that REE recovery and concentration improve with an increasing number of microextractors. Using eight microextractors, along with optimised pH and recycling, recoveries exceed 92 %, purities reach 93 %, and concentrations are at least six times higher than the feed. The REEs extraction microfluidic platform has been 3D printed with a modular LEGO (R) type design that facilitates reconfiguration and scalability. Together with the optimisation model, this platform represents a valuable tool for the design and implementation of future critical element mixtures microextraction applications.

AB Electronic waste (e-waste) is a pressing global issue, with an annual production of approximately 50 million tons, causing environmental impacts and increasing raw material demand for new product manufacturing. While discarded electronic devices have reached their useful life as complete products, they often contain valuable components suitable for reuse in new devices. Automated disassembly robots are not yet widely used in the manufacturing industry due to their complexity and precision requirements. This research presents a prototype capable of disassembling two plates joined by four screws, aiming to pave the way for the integration of disassembly robots in the industry and promote circular economy practices. The design of the plates joined by the four screws was carefully formulated, and the required workspace for robot design was determined. A SCARA-type robotic arm with three degrees of freedom, featuring an RRP configuration, was assembled for disassembly tests. The robot was built using cost-effective digital fabrication techniques, specifically 3D printing and laser cutting. The resulting prototype demonstrated efficient movement within the workspace and successfully unscrewed the four joining screws of the plates. After completing the disassembly task, the robot returned to its designated home position. This development showcases the potential of automated disassembly robots to efficiently recycle valuable components and contribute to the circular economy, addressing electronic waste management challenges.

AB The increasing need for environmentally friendly substitutes for petroleum-based polymers has positioned plant-based biopolymers as potential candidates for additive manufacturing, especially in the context of fused deposition modeling (FDM). Though plant-based biopolymers have limited thermal stability, poor mechanical properties, and variable printability, limiting their industrial use. This review seeks to overcome such limitations by examining the intersection of plant biotechnology and polymer engineering, with a particular focus on the optimization of biopolymer performance through genetic engineering, recombinant DNA (rDNA) technologies, and new processing technologies. A multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach, integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms, is suggested to enable optimal material selection based on printability, biodegradability, and mechanical properties. The research consolidates knowledge from recent developments in genetic modification, enzymatic polymerization, and artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational modeling to demonstrate improved polymer characteristics, such as improved tensile strength, improved interlayer adhesion, and improved thermal resistance. The main findings highlight the revolutionary role of AI-aided design loops, digital twins, and biofabrication in the achievement of scalable and high-performance biopolymers. Future research directions focus on integrating synthetic biology, autonomous laboratories, and closed-loop recycling systems toward achieving eco-efficient and next-generation additive manufacturing platforms.

AB Graphene-based hydrogels (GH) have exhibited prominent performances in wastewater treatment. Herein, Special-shaped ZnO tetrapods and TiO2 nanosheets were introduced to the preparation of GH via a one-step hydrothermal reduction method. The ZnO-GH and TiO2-GH composite hydrogel with a uniform 3D network structure and good mechanical properties can be used as an adsorbent for printing and dyeing wastewater. The optimum doping amount of ZnO and TiO2 in the composite hydrogel and the adsorption regularity to rhodamine B (RhB) with different concentrations were discussed. The cyclic adsorption performance and adsorption kinetics were briefly discussed. When the doping ratio of ZnO to graphene oxide (GO) is 5:8, ZnO-GH has the best adsorption rate, which is 71.7%. The best degradation rate appears at a ZnO doping ratio of 1:2, which also shows the best total removal rate of RhB of approximately 82.20%. When the doping ratio of TiO2 to GO is 3:4, the photocatalytic degradation rate is 30.3%, and the total removal rate of RhB reaches 99.1%, which indicates that RhB can be almost completely removed by TiO2-GH through adsorption and degradation. After five cycles, the adsorption capacity of ZnO-GH and TiO2-GH for the low RhB concentration is still good. The addition of ZnO and TiO2 improves not only the adsorption and degradation properties of the composite hydrogel but also its recycling performance as a result of the increase in mechanical stability.

AB Food waste and byproducts (FWBP) are a global issue impacting economies, resources, and health. Recycling and utilizing these wastes, due to processing and economic constraints, face various challenges. However, valuable components in food waste inspire efficient solutions like active intelligent packaging. Though research on this is booming, its material selectivity, effectiveness, and commercial viability require further analysis. This paper categorizes FWBP and explores their potential for producing packaging from both animal and plant perspectives. In addition, the preparation/fabrication methods of these films/coatings have also been summarized comprehensively, focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of these methods and their commercial adaptability. Finally, the functions of these films/coatings and their ultimate performance in protecting food (meat, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables) are also reviewed systematically. FWBP provide a variety of methods for the application of edible films, including being made into coatings, films, and fibers for food preservation, or extracting active substances directly or indirectly from them (in the form of encapsulation) and adding them to packaging to endow them with functions such as barrier, antibacterial, antioxidant, and pH response. In addition, the casting method is the most commonly used method for producing edible films, but more film production methods (extrusion, electrospinning, 3D printing) need to be tried to make up for the shortcomings of the current methods. Finally, researchers need to conduct more in-depth research on various active compounds from FWBP to achieve better application effects and commercial adaptability.

AB The development of high-performance, bespoke conductive filament is a challenge to overcome to increase the uptake of additive manufacturing electrochemistry. In this work we report the first conductive filament embedded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). This is achieved through the synthesis of AuNPs within castor oil (AuNP-CO), a recognised plasticiser used to fabricate bespoke conductive filaments. The presence of AuNPs in castor oil is first confirmed through UV-Vis and TEM measurements and after the AuNP-CO is utilised as a substitute for CO within a filament composition comprising of 25 wt% carbon black, 65 wt% recycled PLA and 10 wt% AuNP-CO. The inclusion of AuNP-CO provided both enhanced electrical properties, as well as low- temperature flexibility, without compromising on the thermal stability. This filament was shown to have excellent printability, with the presence of AuNPs confirmed on the surface of the additively manufactured electrodes. The electrodes containing AuNP-CO were benchmarked against only CO containing ones and a commercial alternative, whereby the AuNP-CO electrodes provided enhanced electrochemical performance toward both outer and inner sphere redox probes. Additionally, the AuNP-CO electrodes were shown to have significantly enhanced electroanalytical properties toward the detection of dopamine, showing double the sensitivity. We expect this first report of precious metal nanoparticle embedded conductive filament will broaden the scope of additive manufacturing in electrochemistry and significantly increase the potential for commercially viable products to emerge from this field.

AB An increasing consumers' call for natural aromas fuels the development of biotechnological aroma production. Although aroma fermentation is quite advantageous, especially severe product losses of volatile compounds through the bioreactor off-gas may challenge the downstream processing. The application of novel process intensification methods to overcome the common drawbacks of conventional apparatuses might be helpful on a way to commercial competitiveness of biotechnological aromas. This study explored the suitability of rotating packed bed (RPB), a rotating mass transfer enhancing machine, for the absorption of model aroma compounds in rapeseed oil. Increasing the rotation speed from 500 to 2750 rpm led to two- to threefold higher absorption efficiencies at elsewise constant conditions. Aiming for an enriched aromatic intermediate, 2.5 L of rapeseed oil was processed in a recycle for 200 minutes, and a final concentration of benzaldehyde of 0.323 +/- 0.026 g/L(oil)was achieved. Compared to packed columns, the RPB outperforms at equal packing depth or requires less packing area to deliver same efficiency. Especially, the use of custom 3D-printed spiral packing with elaborated wall film flow combined with rotation supported liquid distribution allows using absorbents with viscosities as high as 100 mPa center dot s at low pressure drop increase. However, small dimensions severely limit the performance of a laboratory-scale RPB as the casing contributes disproportionally to mass transfer.

AB The data available in this article presents the tensile creep behaviors and dynamic mechanical properties of polycar-bonate (PC) and the alloy of polycarbonate/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (PC/ABS). Optical method in conjunction with a universal testing machine was used to get the creep deformation, and finally obtained the creep strain-time curves at different stress levels. The tensile creep stress levels for PC were 52 MPa, 50 MPa, 49 MPa, 48 MPa, 47 MPa, 41 MPa, and 47 MPa, 45 MPa, 43 MPa, 41 MPa, 39 MPa, 30 MPa for PC/ABS. Furthermore, the microstructural images of the creep fracture surface of PC and PC/ABS at different stress levels were obtained by using scanning electron mi-croscope (SEM). Finally, the dynamic mechanical raw data of PC and PC/ABS were tested using dynamic mechanical analy-sis (DMA), and the dynamic mechanical properties of PC/ABS at three frequencies (0.1 Hz, 1 Hz and 10 Hz) were presented. The creep data can be reused to predict the long-term creep behavior of PC and PC/ABS, either by modeling predictions or by using the superposition principle to construct a long-term creep master curve. The SEM images and dynamic me-chanical data can facilitate the investigating of the viscoelas-tic mechanism of PC and PC/ABS. These data can also be reused for comparison with PC and PC/ABS manufactured using other methods, such as 3D printed or recycled. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB An integral part of the rapid development of modern technologies is additive manufacturing (AM) or threedimensional (3D) printing, which produces specific products that can replace the classic subtractive methods of machining or conventional manufacturing (CM). This study assessed the manufacturing processes of these two methods during the production of an air ejector and a centric orifice plate using the life cycle assessment (LCA) with the cradle-to-grave method, supported by experimental measurements. In general, the study serves as a tool for the companies for the development of circular economy. This study is specifically focused on and conducted for the industrial sector in the Czech Republic. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of the energy and material flows during the processes of mining, production of semi-finished products, processing of byproducts, and subsequent recycling. Moreover, it includes an assessment of the production of emissions and their effect and impact on the environment and, subsequently, the social aspect. It was found that from a primary energy demand (PED) perspective, AM single build is 30% more demanding in the case without recycling and 27.5% more demanding with the inclusion of the end-of-life phase. Moreover, the impact of AM is greater in four out of six impact categories for the ReCiPe 2016v 1.1 methodology. In addition, for the CML 2001 - Aug. 2016 methodology, AM is greater in four out of five categories. Finally, AM is greater in four out of four impact categories for the EF 3.0 methodology. The study highlights the hypothesis based on the production time for the full build, where from a PED perspective, AM with the end-of-life phase is only 2.76% and 3.89% more demanding with and without the offsetting of time deviation, respectively. The results of this study discuss the potential development and reduction of the burden on the environment during the life cycle of AM, especially during the cooling AM and the production of metallic powder. Although previous studies compared AM and CM were conducted, common and simple rotating components were virtually absent. This study aims to address this problem and arouse interest in the development of the issues presented.

AB Synthesis of high molecular weight long-chain aliphatic polyesters with mechanical properties similar to polyethylene is challenging. This study presents high molecular weight biobased polyesters synthesized via a three-step process involving transesterification, polycondensation, and postcondensation, using biobased 1,18-dimethyl octadecanedioate (C18-diester) and natural diols ranging from C3 to C12. All polyesters achieved weight-average molecular weights over 110 000 g/mol. The crystalline structures and thermomechanical properties of polyesters were largely influenced by the chain length of diols, with an odd-even effect observed. These polyesters exhibit tensile properties mimicking HDPE and LDPE, which allowed successful processing into filaments and 3D-printed objects. Although these polyesters exhibit semicrystalline structures similar to polyethylene, their melting temperatures are significantly lower, especially compared to HDPE. Chemical recycling of a representative polyester demonstrated its ability to undergo depolymerization and repolymerization, with the recovered polyesters displaying comparable mechanical properties to the virgin one. Coarse-grained molecular dynamic simulations of these polyesters demonstrated crystallization of the materials upon cooling from melts and reproduced the decrease in crystallization temperature with an increase in the ester-to-methylene ratio observed in the experiments. The proposed modeling approach allowed us to track the growth of crystalline domains upon cooling from the melt by characterizing the local nematic order parameter to quantify the effect of ester groups on the crystallization process. This study addresses common challenges that complicate synthesis and polymer processing, providing useful guidance for achieving reproducible polyester preparation.

AB The efficient synthesis of polar-functionalized polypropylenes with high molecular weight and high stereoregularity represents a challenging task. This challenge becomes even more daunting when pursuing an industrially preferred heterogeneous process. This study demonstrated the realization of these goals through the use of commercial heterogeneous Ziegler-Natta catalysts in the copolymerization of propylene with ionic cluster polar monomers. The results revealed high copolymerization activity (similar to 1.1 x 10(7) g mol(-1) h(-1)), moderate polar monomer incorporation ratios (similar to 4.9 mol %), high copolymer molecular weight (M-w > 10(5) g mol(-1)), high stereoregularity ([mmmm] similar to 96%), and high melting temperature range (150-162 degrees C). The utilization of ionic cluster polar monomers improved the thermal stability as well as stereoselectivity of the catalyst. Moreover, the Ziegler-Natta catalyst can homopolymerize ionic cluster polar monomers with high activities (>10(4) g mol(-1) h(-1)). The resulting polar-functionalized isotactic polypropylenes (iPP) exhibited superior tensile strength, impact strength, creep resistance, transparency, and crystallinity compared with nonpolar iPP. This enhancement was attributable to the dual roles of the ionic cluster polar monomer unit, serving as both a transparent nucleating agent and a dynamic cross-linking functionality. Furthermore, the polar-functionalized iPP exhibited improved compatibility with polar materials, offering benefits for applications in composites, recycling of mixed plastic wastes, 3D printing, and other fields. This study offered a comprehensive solution for the future industrial production of polar-functionalized iPP via copolymerization, bridging the gap between an efficient and practical copolymerization process from a synthetic chemistry perspective and enhanced material properties from an application perspective.

ID CONCRETE; PERFORMANCE
AB The tensile zone of concrete is prone to cracking due to its limited ability to withstand tension. To address this issue, steel reinforcement is used in these specific regions. The occurrence of little cracks might potentially facilitate the ingress of liquids and gases into the reinforcing material, hence inducing corrosion. Self-healing concrete can repair and seal minuscule cracks, thus impeding the formation of corrosion. This study investigates the potential application of fused deposition modeling (FDM) for generating novel vascular networks and tubes using polylactic acid (PLA) as the material. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) was fabricated using three-dimensional (3D) printing techniques, and its properties were compared to those of one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) networks. The external diameter measured 5.6 mm, while the internal diameter measured 4 mm. utilized a 10 ml volume to apply healing agents, specifically organic polyethylene glycol liquid and nano-powder (fly ash) derived from recycled materials, to all vascular structures (1D, 2D, and 3D). This application was carried out using a planetary ball mill. Following this, the prepared tubes were incorporated into a concrete beam to introduce self-healing capabilities. The water-to-cement ratio (W/C) utilized for all concrete mixtures was 0.6%, while the definite mixture proportions were 1:2.16:2.98. The quantification of the self-healing phenomenon was conducted by evaluating the restoration of load-carrying capacity following the application of a repaired specimen to a four-point bending test. Furthermore, these enhancements resulted in improved durability, increased compressive strength, and enhanced other physical characteristics. The pipes that are manufactured can be utilized to produce innovative concrete that possesses the ability to undergo self-healing processes by combining low-viscosity healing solutions (PEG) with powders (nano fly ash) that are appropriate for this application by injection into the vascular network , making it well-suited for various self-healing applications.

AB Circular product design is a relatively new approach to design suitable strategies to realize circular products. Additive manufacturing (AM) is seen as a promising enabling production process. It has digital and additive characteristics, which makes AM different from conventional production techniques. However, it is yet unclear how this technique can contribute to circular product design in practice. In this paper, a literature review is placed in context, i.e. the results of a literature review on sustainability opportunities in AM are compared to five typical design cases in a design review.
   The outcomes of the literature study reveal the aspects of the digital and additive characteristics of AM, that lead to potential sustainability opportunities. We compared these aspects to the circular design strategies as described by Bakker et al. (2014) and Bocken et al. (2016) in the context of the five selected design projects. Each project is described in terms of circular design strategies and how these were achieved through additive manufacturing.
   Using design practice to reflect on the outcomes of the literature review resulted in a better understanding of the potential of additive manufacturing for circular product design. The relation between the sustainability aspects of AM and the circular design strategies were made explicit. AM seems to be especially suitable to customize parts to fit existing products and to contribute to new opportunities regarding material recycling. These findings deserve further exploration in order to understand the motives for implementation in circular product design.

AB Online purchasing, and hence e-commerce packaging production and use, have grown steadily in recent years, and so has their environmental impact as a result. This paper reviews the evolution of packaging over the last century through a compilation of scientific literature on e-commerce packaging focusing on its environmental side. The primary aims were to identify research gaps in e-commerce packaging and to propose new research lines aimed at reducing its environmental impact.
   A systematic search of abstracts was conducted to identify articles dealing with sustainability in e-commerce packaging in order to better understand changes in materials and formats, identify problems such as oversizing and allow prospective readers to become acquainted with the latest innovations in materials, sustainability and logistics.
   Based on existing research, packaging materials and technology evolved rapidly until the 1990s. Later, however, it has become increasingly difficult to further reduce their cost and environmental impact. Also, some packaging products continue to be made from non-renewable materials and thus restrict growth of e-commerce. Further research is needed with a view to producing new packages from renewable sources such as cellulose-containing materials, which are widely available in nature, or from recycled cellulose-based materials such as cartonboard. Improving distribution processes with new, more effective tools could additionally help alleviate the environmental impact of packaging. Similarly, new production processes such as additive manufacturing and 3D printing might help optimize package volume and shape, thereby facilitating more sustainable production through, for example, reduced CO2 emissions. Currently available technology can be useful to rethink the whole e-commerce packaging paradigm, which has changed very little over the past few decades. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Herein, we explore the potential of innovative manufacturingtechniquesbased on green chemistry principles, for the fabrication of convenient,performant, and stable supported photocatalysts to be used for waterdepollution. After giving some insight into the use of fractal geometryfor the fabrication of tunable polymer supports for photocatalysts,we investigated the use of liquid crystal display (LCD) 3D printingto generate the fractal resin substrates to be used for the immobilizationof semiconductor photocatalysts. Notably, confocal laser imaging wasused as a first attempt for assessing the surface area of the fractalsubstrate. Immobilization methods based on cold plasma discharge (CPD)were employed to modify the surface of the polymer substrates andpermanently anchor three different phases, namely, nickel-based metal-organicframework (Ni-MOF), BiOI, and AgVO3, in a hierarchicalconfiguration. Herein, for the first time, we developed a plasma-initiatedcondensed in situ complexation-assisted precipitation(c-ISCAP) method that allowed 2D Ni-MOF to be synthesized directlyonto the surface of a polymer substrate, in a single step. Not onlythis MOF coating was found to be strongly bound to the surface ofthe polymer substrate but also very uniform and fully functional,even when other inorganic phases were immobilized on the top of thislayer. This chemical approach opens the way for the fabrication ofhybrid materials with complex polymer substrates and MOF coatingsthat could be used in a range of possible applications, for instanceas chemical sensors, electrodes, adsorbents, optical devices, etc.Our hybrid photocatalysts were tested via photodegradation of RhodamineB (RhB) dye upon visible light activation, with recycling runs toassess their durability. It was found that the hierarchical heterojunctionNi-MOF/BiOI/AgVO3 showed an outstanding ability for theremoval of RhB dye, owing to the activity of the Ni-MOF layer in termsof charge transfer, and also partly because of its adsorbing potential.The three photoactive phases demonstrated a strong synergistic effectthrough coupling. However, more importantly, our findings show thattheir immobilization itself, regardless of the method used, significantlymodified their optoelectronic properties, hence most likely changingthe overall mechanism of charge transfer in the heterojunction. TheNi-MOF phase, notably, was found to display a reduced bandgap whenobtained by c-ISCAP, which contributed to enhance its activation byvisible light irradiation. Finally, it was established that the fractalgeometry had a significant impact on the efficiency of the supportedcatalysts, probably thanks to an increased immobilization ratio ofphotocatalyst mostly, owing to the larger surface area available.

AB High-specific-surface-area ceramic catalyst carriers with hierarchical pores are conducive to catalytic reactions and filtration processes in the chemical engineering industry. However, conventional processes have difficulty manufacturing porous ceramics with extremely intricate structures. Herein, a novel method was proposed to fabricate alumina ceramic catalyst carriers with a high specific surface area (SSA) and hierarchical porosity by powder bed fusion (PBF) using micromesoporous gamma-alumina as a pore-forming powder and an impregnation process of colloidal silica. Hierarchical porosity adjustable on the nm (6.03-32.37 nm), mu m (24-30 mu m), and mm (0.5 similar to 4.4 mm) scales was obtained by adopting and adjusting the PBF, impregnation process on preforms and postsintering process. The impacts of SiO2 content and post sintering temperatures on mechanical properties, pore characteristics, and SSA have been scientifically researched. The PBF-formed alumina ceramics possessed a crush strength of 45.88 +/- 3.79 N/cm, high SSA of 56.324 m(2)/g, and porosity of 72.88 +/- 3.37 % with multimodal distributions at 12.24 nm, 32.37 nm, and 24.18 mu m. The improvement of SSA was mainly attributed to the use of micromesoporous gamma-alumina and an impregnation process to reduce 3D-printing defects to obtain the hierarchical porosity (nm similar to mu m scales) and required strength at a lower sintering temperature. Monolithic catalyst carriers with controllable porous structures have been manufactured to facilitate industrial recycling and improve efficiency.

AB The rapid urbanisation and infrastructure development projects have increased infinite property regeneration and construction projects in the developed countries. This study aims to examine the current construction waste management literature, including key authors, university networks, and relevant information systems, considering four selected countries, including Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This paper uses a set of novel metrics, query-based search, and social network analysis techniques for evaluating a dataset of 2337 papers published in a decade by authors from different countries investigating the topic of recycling and reuse of construction and demolition waste in order to identify prominent researchers, influential universities, collaboration practices, and research trends. The dataset of publications is collected from Scopus and analysed using a set of network analysis techniques and statistical analysis. An additional dataset of keywords was collected from the Twitter pages of engineering firms and other relevant industry organisations to assess any possible connection between industry interests and research trends. In order to present a solid analysis of the current investigations in the field, a scientometric analysis along with a rigor statistical method was adopted to carefully identify trends, detailed sub-topics, and the materials investigated in the literature. A probit regression model for testing differences between countries in recycling practices was utilised in the STATA environment. The findings show a set of network analysis and clusters that can help scholars to set their future studies based on the current advances and limitations identified in the literature. Within the dataset, 42% of publications referred to concrete waste, whilst only 2.2% included glass, 2.5% included brick, 4.3% included steel and none included wood, which shows the most common building materials have not been fully covered in the literature. Only 48 publications, or 7.4% of the dataset, originated from the three selected concrete-focused journals. It was also found that information systems appeared in the database lately; however, there is less discussion in the literature on how the integration of Geographic Information System (GIS), Buidling Information Model (BIM), 3D Printing and geo-spatial data analysis can help waste management in the field of construction. The bibliographic analysis of the selected cases shows that universities in Canada and the US exhibit more evidence of domestic collaboration and industry partnerships than universities in Australia and the UK. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that publications with at least one industry co-author are more likely to address the issue of regulation. The outcome of this paper enables academics, engineers, and regulators to predict research trends, improve industry collaborations and utilise information systems and assign more research resources to address the identified gaps in the literature.

AB Data-driven technology such as Artificial Intelligence is considered an essential enabler of circular economy (CE) in the building construction industry (BCI). As both AI and CE applications are emerging areas in the BCI, there exists little systematic guidance on how AI can be applied to capture the full potential of systemic circularity along the building product lifecycle. To fill this gap, this study provides an extensive systematic review of scien-tific research advancement in AI and CE in the BCI. AI algorithms for enabling systemic circularity in the BCI were discussed alongside their respective Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats, and Opportunities (SWOT) analysis con-cerning CE solutions. Further, thirteen application areas of the AI models were illustrated and summarised using a tree diagram. Among the application areas include circular materials selection, design for disassembly, pre-demolition auditing, demolition waste sorting, materials strength prediction, technical and economic circu-larity of materials, operation of circular business model, onsite waste recycling, and reverse logistics. In addition, the profound challenges of applying AI in enabling CE implementation in BCI were identified and their potential solutions were highlighted. A holistic framework integrating the AI models and their application domains along the building product lifecycle was developed. Future research directions including a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) adaptive control system for circularity, AI in 3D printing of circular materials, optimisation of management infrastructure for circular products, optimisation of circular business model and reverse logistics are highlighted. The findings have delineated the core application domains of AI in enabling CE adoption along the building lifecycle and provided insightful future research needs that could promote digital systemic circularity in BCI.(c) 2022 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB Over the past decades, natural fibers have become an important constituent in multiple engineering- and biomaterials. Their high specific strength, biodegradability, low-cost production, recycle-ability, vast availability and easy processing make them interesting for many applications. However, fiber swelling due to moisture uptake poses a key challenge, as it significantly affects the geometric stability and mechanical properties. To characterize the hygro-mechanical behavior of fibers in detail, a novel micromechanical characterization method is proposed which allows continuous full-field fiber surface displacement measurements during wetting and drying. A single fiber is tested under an optical height microscope inside a climate chamber wherein the relative humidity is changed to capture the fiber swelling behavior. These fiber topographies are, subsequently, analyzed with an advanced Global Digital Height Correlation methodology dedicated to extract the full three-dimensional fiber surface displacement field. The proposed method is validated on four different fibers: flat viscose, trilobal viscose, 3D-printed hydrogel and eucalyptus, each having different challenges regarding their geometrical and hygroscopic properties. It is demonstrated that the proposed method is highly robust in capturing the full-field fiber kinematics. A precision analysis shows that, for eucalyptus, at 90% relative humidity, an absolute surface strain precision in the longitudinal and transverse directions of, respectively, 1.2 x 10(-4)and 7 x 10(-4)is achieved, which is significantly better than existing techniques in the literature. The maximum absolute precision in both directions for the other three tested fibers is even better, demonstrating that this method is versatile for precise measurements of the hygro-expansion of a wide range of fibers.

AB Thermally reversible epoxies through the Diels-Alder (DA) reaction have been used for applications such as recycling, self-healing, and 3D printing. Depolymerization by bulk heating, however, would be a slow and inefficient process due to its low thermal conductivity. In this paper, photothermal conversion using refractory plasmonic titanium nitride (TiN) nanoparticles was employed for efficient and rapid depolymerization of reversible epoxies. TiN nanoparticles have superior thermal stability, broader light absorption, and higher light-to-heat conversion efficiency. They are also less expensive than more common plasmonic gold nanoparticles. Photothermal behavior of TiN nanoparticle-filled reversible epoxies was investigated as a function of concentration of TiN nanoparticles and as a function of the intensity of a light source. TiN nanoparticles could induce sufficient heat for depolymerization with a trace content, 0.01% by weight, under a broad-spectrum white light of intensity 1760 mW/cm(2) instead of a strong light source such as a laser. The reversible epoxies were prepared by a reaction between furan precursors and a bismaleimide compound. Crosslinking density was controlled by altering the architecture of furan precursors and the feed ratio between the furan precursor and the bismaleimide compound. These changes in chemical structure and degree of crosslinking permit the control of the thermomechanical properties of the reversible epoxy from soft elastomers to hard elastomers. The reversible epoxies display a flow region at around 110 degrees C. Depolymerization through the retro-DA was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as a function of duration at a high temperature. Light-induced removability and recyclability were demonstrated by adhesion tests using the reversible epoxy/nanoparticle composites.

AB The history of aluminum is rather short since it was discovered only in the nineteenth century, yet it has become an important part of everyday life. This article reviews the history of aluminum through technological break-throughs as well as from cultural and social perspectives, beginning with its discovery, through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries until today; and aims to suggest possible future trends and applications for aluminum alloys. Aluminum has a high strength-to-weight ratio combined with excellent thermal conductivity and good corrosion resistance. Therefore, aluminum is an attractive material for many applications, including transportation, electrical and packaging industries, architecture, and food industries. It is also a recyclable metal, which provides both environmental and economic advantages. The commercial use of aluminum started at the end of the nineteenth century and continues to grow today with the development of new advanced aluminum alloys. Consequently, from a cultural perspective, aluminum is considered a symbol of modernity. Technological breakthroughs generate economic growth and social benefits. Present applications of aluminum include new choices, such as 3D printing, composite materials, nano-rods, biomedicine devices and aerospace uses. Based on the excellent properties of aluminum, its low price, combined with its significant scrap value and a growing recycling market, as well as its accelerating global production, it is expected that the aluminum industries will considerably grow through the twenty-first century and aluminum will continue to be a major part of our everyday culture. Therefore, based on the increasing growth of aluminum production and consumption, additional research and development effort is needed in the following years to minimize the negative environmental side effects associated with the technological developments related to aluminum production and at the same time creating further technological innovation.

AB Hydrogels, featuring tunable porous structures and efficient mass transport, are promising materials for floatable platforms that improve light absorption, enable continuous operation at gas-liquid interfaces, and protect encapsulated materials and enhance recycling efficiency. Floatable hydrogels notably maximize the use of sunlight at the air-liquid interface, significantly improving solar energy capture and efficiency in photocatalytic and photothermal processes. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in floatable hydrogels, highlighting three major fabrication strategies: chemical cross-linking, pore structure regulation, and surface engineering. Chemical cross-linking is the predominant method, offering strong stability and versatility through monomer selection and cross-linking conditions, though quantitative buoyancy control remains challenging. Pore-structure regulation, including mechanical foaming, agent-based foaming, and bubble locking, enables precise buoyancy control but may compromise structural integrity. Surface engineering usually serves as a complementary strategy by modulating hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity. Advanced fabrication methods such as 3D printing offer promising opportunities. Multifunctional applications of floatable hydrogels are comprehensively reviewed, covering photocatalysis, solar-driven water purification, photothermal energy conversion, wastewater treatment, environmental remediation, and renewable energy harvesting. Emerging fields, including photo-electrocatalysis, electrochemical energy storage, and biomedical engineering, are also discussed. Finally, analytical challenges regarding floating durability, accurate buoyancy tuning, anti-fouling properties, and scalability are critically examined, providing strategic insights for future research directions.

   Four-dimensional characteristics; Meta-structure; In vitro analysis
AB In the recent past, several studies were reported on meta-structure-based direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) of functionally graded materials (FGM) using virgin/recycled metallic powders. But hitherto little has been reported on DMLS of meta-structure-based FGM using a combination of virgin and mixed metallic powder with a single hopper. This study outlines the use of virgin/single and mixed metallic powder for fabricating FGM using DMLS with a single hopper. The study highlights the DMLS of FGM with 17-4 precipitate hardened (PH) stainless steel (SS) virgin powder in a sandwich layer as 'Weaire-Phelan' meta-structure and mixed powder (comprising of 17-4 PH SS (90% by wt.)-Ni-625 (5% by wt.)-Ti-6Al-4V (5% by wt.) collected as waste/mixed powder from DMLS setup) as the top and bottom layers. Results suggested that the surface roughness (Ra) of 3D-printed (by DMLS) FGM was 12.66 mu m, 19.85 mu m, and 12.41 mu m for the top, middle, and bottom layers, respectively. The Ra was improved to 8.59 mu m, 12.35 mu m, and 8.67 mu m after wear testing. Further, after corrosion (in vitro) testing in simulated body fluid, Ra was observed as 13.36 mu m, 14.44 mu m, and 13.46 mu m, respectively. Overall, the wear and corrosive behavior have shown tuneable 4D characteristics for required surface properties in biomedical applications. The results are supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.

AB This study presents the design, modeling, and validation of a mixing screw for energy-efficient single-screw extrusion. The screw features a short length-to-diameter (L/D) ratio of 8:1 and incorporates double flights with variable pitch and counter-rotating mixing slots. These features promote enhanced plastication by breaking up the solid bed and improving thermal homogeneity through backflow mechanisms relieving a 3.75 compression ratio. Non-isothermal, non-Newtonian simulations modeled the thermal and flow behavior for high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) and recycled polypropylene (rPP) under various operating conditions. Experimental validation was conducted using a 20 mm pilot-scale extruder with screw speeds ranging from 10 to 40 RPM and barrel temperatures of 220 degrees C and 240 degrees C. Results showed a strong linear dependence of mass output on screw speed, with maximum mass throughputs of 0.58 kg/h for HIPS and 0.74 kg/h for rPP at 40 RPM. Specific energy consumption (SEC) was calculated as 0.264 kWh/kg for HIPS and 0.344 kWh/kg for rPP, corresponding to efficiencies of 31.5% and 56.5% relative to theoretical minimum energy requirements. Compared to traditional general-purpose and barrier screws with L/D ratios of 27:1, the mixing screw demonstrated improved energy efficiency and reduced residence time distributions. These findings suggest the potential of the mixing screw for compact extrusion systems, including 3D printing and other sustainable polymer and bioplastics processing applications.

DE polymerization-induced crystallization; thiol-ene; photopolymerization;
   polymer structure-properties; toughness; thermoplastic
AB Thermoplastics encompass the majority of commercial plastics but are limited to manufacturing techniques that require heat and/or solvent to enable material reprocessing and reshaping. Photopolymerization offers a readily accessible in situ alternative to conventional processing techniques but has typically been restricted to cross-linked networks, thus removing the potential for recycling/reprocessing of the materials. In this work, the paradigm of photopolymerizable thermoplastics consisting of semicrystalline thiol-ene polymers with repeat units structures mimicking those of poly(ethylene terephthalate) is explored. These materials are rapidly photopolymerized (<10 s) under mild irradiation conditions by using commercially available, unpurified dithiol and diene monomers to give polymeric materials with distinctive mechanical properties. The complex relationships between monomer structure, crystallization, and material properties (optical, thermal, and mechanical) were investigated by modifying the dithiol alkyl chain length (xDT, x = 2-10). Though subtle, these monomeric structural perturbations significantly impacted both the rate (similar to 0.3-19 MPa min(-1)) and extent of crystallization as well as the corresponding material properties (e.g., Young's modulus and elongation to break ranging from 80-280 MPa and 500-840%, respectively). To confirm the expansive applicability of this facile photopolymerization method, substitutions to the diene functionalities that participate in crystallization were explored to understand the relationship between the monomer structure, the extent of crystallinity, and the mechanical performance. The photopolymers reported herein provide a basic framework to expand access to photocurable step-growth linear polymers with well-controlled polymerization-induced crystallization for a variety of applications, including for the rapid manufacture of prototypical or sacrificial components in 3D printing.

AB The application of electrochemical flow reactors for electrosynthetic processes on a laboratory or pilot scale has recently gained increased attention as they provide reliable and improved performance and facilitate a further scale-up. We investigated in this study the electrochemical reduction of vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde) to its pinacolization product hydrovanilloin, a building block in the synthesis of biobased polymers, in a divided plane parallel flow reactor in batch recycle operation mode. First, the mass transport of the flow reactor was characterized with dimensionless groups using the ferricyanide ion / ferrocyanide ion system as model reaction. The mass transport was further improved by 3D-printed turbulence promoters. We then studied the electrochemical vanillin reduction monitored by an online UV-cell setup at various electrolyte flow rates up to 20 cm s(-1) and current densities up to 50 mA cm(-2) with total conversions of 95%. Key figures of merit such as Faradaic efficiencies, space-time-yields and specific energy consumptions were calculated and a simple model was used to describe vanillin concentration decays and courses of these key figures of merit. The model distinguishes between a kinetic and mass transport-controlled zone, which transition point was predicted based on the mass transport characterization results. Lastly, we developed based on the model an operational process improvement strategy for fast and energy efficient production of hydrovanilloin and validated it experimentally. This study reports a first engineering approach for the production of vanillin-based polymer building blocks in an electrochemical flow reactor highlighting the ability of simple prediction models.

AB Sustainable building materials are products with a relatively positive impact on economies, communities and the environment. Understanding the key indicators in developing sustainable building materials, which affect the economic, social and environmental aspects of buildings, is a critical perspective to aid their evolution. Research in sustainable building materials is relatively new, and therefore this study examined the existing literature on sustainable building materials in academic journals with the intent of identifying and clustering key indicators and proposing a conceptual framework for the development of sustainable building materials. This study employed a verifiable and reproducible systematic literature review of building materials, analyzing and scrutinizing 203 academic articles for the cooccurrence of keywords, using a mixed bibliographic and bibliometric method. It emerged from the study that the groups themed "Process", "Material", "Element" and "Technology" contained the greatest number of, and most statistically significant, indicators associated with sustainable building material. It was found that, in developing and evaluating sustainable building materials, sustainability, LCA (Life Cycle Assessment), embodied energy and recycling appear to be the predominant processes used; concrete, bricks, C&D (Construction and Demolition) waste, and fibre are the foremost materials; walls and roofs are the main building components; and composite, 3D printing, nanotechnology and prefabrication are the leading technology features. Also, the results of the analysis of interconnections between indicators revealed that a significant interconnection exists between embodied energy, LCA, concrete, composite and durability to the sustainability of building materials. Based on the taxonomy of indicators and the analysis of their interconnections, a conceptual framework for developing sustainable building materials was proposed in the paper.

ID VALIDATION
AB Roller compaction is a widely used continuous dry granulation process in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The flow and distribution of the powder across the rollers in the compaction area plays a crucial role in determining the quality of the final product. Non-uniform powder flow and distribution across the rollers can lead to variations in quality across the ribbon, resulting in uneven qualities in the granules. Hence, it is essential to enhance the powder flow and distribution across the rollers in the compaction area. Besides that, insufficient compaction stress on both sides of the roller edges can also contribute to presence of uncompacted fines during compaction process. This research aims to systematically study a whole range of customized guiders design (T-1 until T-14) that improves powder flow and distribution across the rollers and reduces the percentage of fines in the compaction zone. The 3D printed customized guiders with different grade (1 mm until 14 mm) were applied in roller compactor with horizontal feeding system to control the amount of powder passing through the roller width by guiding more powder to the sides between the rollers and less powder to the centre. The effectiveness of the design was validated by examining crystalline and spray dry lactose powders with varying flowabilities using online thermal imaging. The results demonstrate a significant trend, indicating improved uniformity of powder flow and distribution across the rollers and reduced production of fines. These findings have the potential to contribute to long-term sustainability and resource conservation in industrial applications by reducing the need for material recycling and lowering energy consumption in continuous processes.

AB Digital technologies are becoming increasingly involved with business' operations, organizations, and society at large. Their integration aims to streamline resource allocation, refine process efficiency, and facilitate decision -making processes, with a reduced need for human intervention. In the context of a circular economy, these technologies have the potential to enhance resource distribution practices, diminish waste generation, and enable reutilization and recycling efforts. From this perspective, interest arises in analyzing the evolution of digital technologies and the circular economy, taking into account the scientific and academic publications made in this area worldwide. This research presents an analysis of the most prominent trends in academic literature, focusing on technical and scientific information published in peer -reviewed sources worldwide. To accomplish this, in the study diverse techniques were applied, including bibliographic review, bibliometric analysis, and content analysis. These methodologies were used to evaluate literature published in specialized journals and conferences during the study period from 2018 to 2022. The study's most relevant findings reveal that both the scientific and academic communities are progressively invested in exploring the interplay between digital technologies and the circular economy. These findings indicate that digital technologies hold immense potential as enablers and drivers of circular economy practices worldwide. For this research digital technologies considered were those related to artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, blockchain technology, digital twins, additive manufacturing or 3D printing, robotics, big data, cloud computing, machine learning, cyber-physical systems, and augmented reality.

AB Our understanding of endocytic pathway dynamics is restricted by the diffraction limit of light microscopy. Although super-resolution techniques can overcome this issue, highly crowded cellular environments, such as nerve terminals, can also dramatically limit the tracking of multiple endocytic vesicles such as synaptic vesicles (SVs), which in turn restricts the analytical dissection of their discrete diffusional and transport states. We recently introduced a pulse-chase technique for subdiffractional tracking of internalized molecules (sdTIM) that allows the visualization of fluorescently tagged molecules trapped in individual signaling endosomes and SVs in presynapses or axons with 30- to 50-nm localization precision. We originally developed this approach for tracking single molecules of botulinum neurotoxin type A, which undergoes activity-dependent internalization and retrograde transport in autophagosomes. This method was then adapted to localize the signaling endosomes containing cholera toxin subunit-B that undergo retrograde transport in axons and to track SVs in the crowded environment of hippocampal presynapses. We describe (i) the construction of a custom-made microfluidic device that enables control over neuronal orientation; (ii) the 3D printing of a perfusion system for sdTIM experiments performed on glass-bottom dishes; (iii) the dissection, culturing and transfection of hippocampal neurons in microfluidic devices; and (iv) guidance on how to perform the pulse-chase experiments and data analysis. In addition, we describe the use of single-molecule-tracking analytical tools to reveal the average and the heterogeneous single-molecule mobility behaviors. We also discuss alternative reagents and equipment that can, in principle, be used for sdTIM experiments and describe how to adapt sdTIM to image nanocluster formation and/or tubulation in early endosomes during sorting events. The procedures described in this protocol take similar to 1 week.

AB Biomass waste is an abundant resource. The current biomass valorisation is focused on purified or more homogeneous streams of waste, such as spent grains from breweries. Mixed plant biomass waste is usually not valorised due to the high cost of separation, collection and transportation. Moreover, the challenge extends to space exploration, where the management of mixed plant biomass waste through storage or incineration is not sustainable for long-duration missions. Additionally, Rockwool, widely used in hydroponics both terrestrially and in space, presents health hazards and environmental disposal issues. There's a critical need to valorise mixed plant biomass waste and to develop safer, more eco-friendly substrates for plant growth. This study presents a circular approach to convert mixed plant biomass waste into bioplastics for plant growth substrates, with the process completed by recycling plant residues back into bioplastics. Mixed garden waste was treated with alkaline hydrogen peroxide (AHP) to enhance cellulose content by 75% while decreasing hemicellulose and lignin contents. The effectiveness of AHP in extracting cellulose was verified using FTIR and SEM analyses. Cellulose was transformed into cellulose acetate (CA) using a green acetylation process, achieving a degree of substitution of 2.5. Triethyl citrate (TEC) plasticized the CA, which was then 3D printed into porous structures for growing garden peas. Post-harvest, the plant debris was reconverted into CA, showcasing a sustainable cycle of plant biomass waste valorisation. This research has proved the concept of converting mixed plant biomass waste into growth substrates for hydroponic systems, offering advantages to the space, horticulture, waste management, and bioplastics sectors.

AB This article describes a bison rib bone foreshaft from the Blackwater Draw site, New Mexico. The object was recovered by James Hester in 1963, during the excavation of locality 4, and it was subsequently cataloged as a modified bone tool but not recognized as a hafting element. It is currently held in the Blackwater Draw Museum collections. This analysis provides a detailed description of the artifact's features and establishes its provenience from a Folsom context. A survey of known Paleoindigenous hafting implements and a discussion of theoretical Folsom foreshaft designs serve to reinforce the classification of the tool as a component of the Folsom weapon delivery system. The tool was likely broken during use and later recycled as a pressure flaker or as a polishing instrument. With the help of 3D imagery, a reconstructed model was printed and fitted with large and small Folsom points to test ideas borrowed from the theoretical literature on Folsom foreshaft design.

Un estudio de los implementos de enastado paleoindigenas conocidos y una discusion de los disenos teoricos de los intermediarios de astil Folsom sirven para reforzar la clasificacion de la herramienta como un componente del sistema de lanzamiento de armas Folsom. Es probable que la herramienta se rompiera durante el uso y luego se reciclara como herramienta para descascarar a presion o como instrumento de pulido. Con la ayuda de imagenes 3D, se imprimio un modelo reconstruido y se le equipo con puntas Folsom grandes y pequenas para probar ideas tomadas de la literatura teorica sobre el diseno de intermediarios Folsom.

AB Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable thermoplastic polymer used in various applications, including food packaging, 3D printing, textiles, and biomedical devices. Nevertheless, it presents several limitations, such as high hydrophobicity, low gas barrier properties, UV sensitivity, and brittleness. To overcome this issue, in this study, biochar (BC) produced through pyrolysis of bio-mass waste was incorporated (1 wt.%, 2wt.%, and 3 wt.%-PLA 1, PLA 2, and PLA 3) to enhance thermal and mechanical properties of PLA composites. The impact of pyrolysis temperature on the kinetic parameters, physicochemical characteristics, and structural properties of banana and orange peels for use as biochar added to PLA was investigated. The biomass waste such as banana and orange peels were characterized by proximal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); meanwhile, the PLA composites were characterized by tensile straight, TGA, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results indicated that the presence of biochar improved hygroscopic characteristics and Tg temperature from 62.98 degrees C for 1 wt.% to 80.29 degrees C for 3 wt.%. Additionally, it was found that the tensile strength of the composites increased by almost 30% for PLA 3 compared with PLA 1. The Young's modulus also increased from 194.334 MPa for PLA1 to 388.314 MPa for PLA3. However, the elongation decreased from 14.179 (PLA 1) to 7.240 mm (PLA3), and the maximum thermal degradation temperature shifted to lower temperatures ranging from 366 degrees C for PLA-1 to 345 degrees C for PLA-3 samples, respectively. From surface analysis, it was observed that the surface of these samples was relatively smooth, but small microcluster BC aggregates were visible, especially for the PLA 3 composite. In conclusion, the incorporation of biochar into PLA is a promising method for enhancing material performance while maintaining environmental sustainability by recycling biomass waste.

AB In an era of increasing environmental concern, oil pollution arising either from marine accidents or from routine ship operations (tanker loading and unloading, etc.) is a major threat for the marine environment. The average quantity of ship-generated oil that ends up in the sea exceeds 350,000 tonnes per year .When an oil spill occurs, either in open or confined sea, the ecological damage on the local ecosystem could be huge and irreversible.
   In view of the above, there is a pressing need for continuous refinement of the existing means and the development and implementation of new technologies with help of Robotics for oil spill combating. To minimize the adverse environmental effects of an oil spill, research should focus to devise technologies that are able to confront the oil, aiming at its actual removal when this is still floating at sea.
   This paper describe robotic unit of high-power autonomy that adsorb oil over water surface with the help of Nano-particle and are able to recover oil from Nano-material when placed in magnetic field. A prototype model of robot with constraint design of floating and assembly of different parts inside it has been made with the help of 3D printing for above investigation. The robots suck oily water separating clear water to the outside and creating a stream of oil in the center. Oil collected during the process is stored in box, which can later be removed by crew members to recycle in magnetic field. Towards these directions, in this paper we present a novel concept for effective oil spill confrontation which is based on autonomous robotic systems using nanotechnology-based techniques.

AB Enormous quantities of pharmaceuticals are consumed by humans leading to a growing and continuous release of harmful components into the environment. Existing conventional water treatment plants are designed mainly for eliminating biodegradable organics and nutrients and cannot degrade pharmaceuticals and personal care products efficiently enough due to their chemical stability. Advanced oxidation processes using radicals generated from ozone can be efficiently combined with heterogeneous catalysis for treatment of wastewater containing pharmaceuticals and personal care products. From the technology viewpoint, elimination of pharmaceuticals from water by heterogeneously catalyzed ozonation should done in a continuous fixed bed reactor. The structured catalysts can be prepared by additive manufacturing using 3D -direct printing of supports/catalysts allowing a high degree of freedom in both the composition and design of the final catalytic material for a fixed bed heterogeneous -homogeneous reaction. Structured materials can exhibit non -periodic structure, such as for example semi -ordered structures, inspired by nature. For periodic and semi -periodic structures, heat and mass transfer should be investigated using computational fluid dynamics and flow imaging methods, guiding further design of novel architectures and subsequently allowing in combination with the materials development efficient control of activity and selectivity. The innovative catalytic reactor engineering should include experimental and numerical investigation of the stage wise injection of the oxidation agent, variation of the reactor cross-section size, changing the distance between the catalyst beds and introduction of the recycle loops.

AB The good cladding of a large-sized Nd-doped phosphate glass slab as a laser amplifier requires not only the amplified spontaneous emission and parasitic oscillation to be fully absorbed, to hold up the small signal gain coefficient of the Nd ions, but also the absorbed heat energy to be appropriately dissipated to extend a uniform temperature field for the larger laser beam aperture of the edge-cladded Nd-glass slab. In the present work, numerical simulations were performed based on the developed feasible edge-cladding designs for a 786 x 436 x 40 mm(3) Nd-glass slab, including the following alterations: optical absorptivity, quantum-dot absorption centers, ceramics with higher thermal diffusivity, glasses with lower and higher specific heat values, 3D printing edge-cladding methods, double-deck edge-cladding structure with transparent strips as a buffer layer, and thickening of the edge-cladding. All of these designed edge-cladding materials, methods, and structures satisfy both requirements of sufficiently absorbing and precisely matching with the refractive index, as emphasized by the edge-cladding for the Nd-glass. Some of the designed edge-claddings resulted in a much more uniform temperature field than the composite polymer-glass edge-cladding as the standard for comparison, which could be utilized to extend the effective laser aperture of the Nd-glass slab, thus being beneficial to the laser beam size and laser energy in the optics recycle loop strategy.

AB The high-value-added and resourceful reuse of solid waste is regarded as a promising technological approach within the construction industry, playing a vital role in advancing sustainable development and ecological civilization. In this study, VOSviewer and CiteSpace were utilized to systematically perform a bibliometric analysis of research related to the reutilization of solid waste in the construction sector, using data from the Web of Science Core Collection and Scopus databases. The analysis focused on publication volume over the last decade, global collaboration networks, thematic journals, keyword co-occurrence, and timeline clustering. The results reveal that: (1) The number of publications related to solid waste in construction has steadily increased over the last decade; (2) Significant research contributions have been observed from China. However, a cohesive core of contributing authors has yet to emerge, and broader, more equitable international collaboration remains necessary; (3) Research foundations span disciplines such as environmental science, materials science, physics, and chemistry, indicating a clear trend of interdisciplinary integration; (4) Current research primarily explores the performance and environmental impacts of concrete and waste-derived materials. Over time, topics have expanded from early explorations to include environmental assessments, waste management, and the circular economy, increasingly advanced technologies to investigate high-performance and diverse material applications. In the future, the energy efficiency and green sustainability of solid waste are expected to draw continued attention, with emerging technologies such as 3D printing and artificial intelligence likely to foster more interdisciplinary research in optimizing material performance.

AB COVID-19 has exposed stark inequalities between resource-rich and resource-poor countries. International UN- and WHO-led efforts, such as COVAX, have provided SARS-CoV-2 vaccines but half of African countries have less than 2% vaccinated in their population, and only 15 have reached 10% by October 2021, further disadvantaging local economic recovery. Key for this implementation and preventing further mutation and spread is the frequency of voluntary [asymptomatic] testing. It is limited by expensive PCR and LAMP tests, uncomfortable probes deep in the throat or nose, and the availability of hardware to administer in remote locations. There is an urgent need for an inexpensive "end-to-end" system to deliver sensitive and reliable, non-invasive tests in resource-poor and field-test conditions. We introduce a non-invasive saliva-based LAMP colorimetric test kit and a $51 lab-in-a-backpack system that detects as few as 4 viral RNA copies per mu L. It consists of eight chemicals, a thermometer, a thermos bottle, two micropipettes and a 1000-4000 rcf electronically operated centrifuge made from recycled computer hard drives (CentriDrive). The centrifuge includes a 3D-printed rotor and a 12 V rechargeable Li-ion battery, and its 12 V standard also allows wiring directly to automobile batteries, to enable field-use of this and other tests in low infrastructure settings. The test takes 90 minutes to process 6 samples and has reagent costs of $3.5 per sample. The non-invasive nature of saliva testing would allow higher penetration of testing and wider adoption of the test across cultures and settings (including refugee camps and disaster zones). The attached graphical procedure would make the test suitable for self-testing at home, performing it in the field, or in mobile testing centers by minimally trained staff.

AB The circular economy is presented as the sustainable solution as opposed to the current linear model of production and resource management, whose effects impact negatively on the economic, social and environmental dimensions. Through a systematic review of the literature, this article aims to unify and to uncover the available evidence on innovation in relation to the circular economy and to determine those aspects that remain unexplored or should be studied in more depth in order to be able to continue to make progress in this field. Thus, it was found that although the circular economy is at an early stage of implementation, both its benefits and drivers as well as its challenges and barriers to implementation have already been investigated. More importantly, it was found that ecological innovations, which reduce the environmental impact of production and consumption activities, are necessary for the research of new business models and new ways of operating in supply chains that allow closing the circle and taking advantage of all the waste, such as the system of products and services, dynamic capabilities, 3D printing, the biography of the product and the software recycling. To achieve this goal, the evidence shows that it is mandatory to raise awareness of the situation, especially through marketing actions, as well as for companies, including SMEs, to be willing to act together and to align their interests.
   Implications for Central European audience: The United Nations 2030 Agenda includes 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), according to which countries should implement the circular economy in order to move towards greater sustainability. In this context, European Union is key for this development, as it is one of the world's major power. This article aims to unify and uncover the available evidence on innovation in relation to the circular economy and to determine those aspects that remain unexplored or should be studied in more depth. By doing so, it will be able to continue to make progress in the framework of the circular economy, enabling the achievement of the ODS. In addition, the majority of the articles reviewed take place in Europe.

AB Purpose Digital innovation and circular business model innovation are two critical enablers of a circular economy. A wide variety of digital technologies such as blockchain, 3D printing, cyber-physical systems, or big data also diverges the applications of digital technologies in circular business models. Given heterogeneous attributes of circular business models and digital technologies, the selections of digital technologies and circular business models might be highly distinctive within and between sectorial contexts. This paper examines digital circular business models in the context of the fashion industry and its multiple actors. This industry as the world's second polluting industry requires an urgent circular economy (CE) transition with less resource consumption, lower waste emissions and a more stable economy. Design/methodology/approach An inductive, exploratory multiple-case study method is employed to investigate the ten cases of different sized fashion companies (i.e. large, small medium-sized firm (SME) and startup firms). The comparison across cases is conducted to understand fashion firms' distinct behaviours in adopting various digital circular economy strategies. Findings The paper presents three archetypes of digital-based circular business models in the fashion industry: the blockchain-based supply chain model, the service-based model and the pull demand-driven model. Besides incremental innovations, the radical business model and digital innovations as presented in the pull demand-driven model may be crucial to the fashion circular economy transition. The pull demand-driven model may shift the economy from scales to scopes, change the whole process of how the fashion items are forecasted, produced, and used, and reform consumer behaviours. The paths of adopting digital fashion circular business models are also different among large, SMEs and startup fashion firms. Practical implications The study provides business managers with empirical insights on how circular business models (CBMs) should be chosen according to intrinsic business capacities, technological competences and CE strategies. The emerging trends of new fashion markets (e.g. rental, subscription) and consumers' sustainable awareness should be not be neglected. Moreover, besides adopting recycling and reuse strategies, large fashion incumbents consider collaborating with other technology suppliers and startup companies to incubate more radical innovations. Social implications Appropriate policies and regulations should be enacted to enable the digital CE transition. Market patterns and consumer acceptances are considered highly challenging to these digital fashion models. A balanced policy on both the demand and supply sides are suggested. The one-side policy may fail CBMs that entail an upside-down collaboration of both producers and consumers. Moreover, it is perhaps time to rethink how to reduce unnecessary new demand rather than repeatedly producing and recycling. Originality/value The pace of CE research is lagging far behind the accelerating environmental contamination by the fashion industry. The study aims to narrow the gap between theory and practice to harmonise fashion firms' orchestration and accelerate the transition of the fashion industry towards the CE. This study examines diverse types of digital technologies in different circular business models in a homogeneous context of the fashion industry with heterogeneous firm types.

AB Additive manufacturing of metal parts is supplied by powder or wire. Manufacturing of this raw material causes additional costs and environmental impact. A new technique is proposed where the feeding directly originates from a metal sheet, which can even be waste. When cutting is done by laser-induced boiling, melt is continuously ejected downwards underneath the sheet. The ejected melt is deposited as a track on a substrate, enabling additive manufacturing by substrate movement along a desired path. The melt first flows downwards as a column and after a few millimeters separates into drops, here about 500 micrometer in diameter, as observed by high speed imaging. The drops incorporate sequentially and calmly into a long melt pool on the substrate. While steel drops formed regular tracks on steel and aluminium substrates, on copper substrate periodic drops solidified instead. For this new technique, called CYCLAM, the laser beam acts indirectly while the drop jet becomes the main tool. From imaging, properties like the width or fluctuations of the drop jet can be statistically evaluated. Despite oscillation of the liquid column, the divergence of the drop jet remained small, improving the precision and robustness. The melt leaves the cut sheet as a liquid column, 1 to 4 mm in length, which periodically separates drops that are transferred as a liquid jet to the substrate. For very short distance of 2 to 3 mm between the two sheets this liquid column can transfer the melt continuously as a liquid bridge. This phenomenon was observed, as a variant of the technique, but the duration of the bridge was limited by fluid mechanic instabilities. (C) 2017 The authors. Published by Elsevier B.Y.

AB New materials which have the potential to reversible topology rearrangement based on the dynamic covalent bonds are continually emerging. In the past decade, the research on dynamic covalent polymers has achieved notable progress in the preparation and proof-of-concept applications. Dynamic covalent polymer is a type of polymer material containing dynamic covalent bond in molecular chains. The bond energy of dynamic covalent bonds is lower than that of stable covalent bonds, but higher than that of non-covalent bonds, such as ionic bonds, coordination bonds, hydrogen bonds, or van der Waals forces. The reversible reaction can be triggered by external stimulus such as light, heat, force, and pH, while polymers with dynamic covalent bonds can maintain structural stability as the irreversible covalent polymers after removing the applied stimuli. Compared with the traditional thermosets with three-dimensional cross-linker networks, the dynamic reversible process endows the cross-linker polymer with certain degree of controllable degradation, recycling, self-healing, and other excellent properties, which is hard for conventional covalent polymers to achieve. Dynamic covalent polymers possess both the mechanical properties of traditional thermosets and the thermodynamic lability of supramolecular polymers. It has shown great potential in the application of intelligent devices such as flexible electronic skin, shape memory, 3D and 4D printing, intelligent sensors, etc., and presented great potential in industrial scale. In this review, various types of dynamic covalent bonds and their reactions are introduced, including carbon radical exchange, olefin metathesis, DA reaction, disulfide bond exchange, disulfide-thiol exchange, etc. Then the structural design, properties, and applications of polymer materials containing different types of dynamic covalent bonds are briefly summarized. This provides a certain theoretical guidance for the study of reversible polymers. Finally, the future development and scientific challenge of dynamic covalent polymers are prospected and discussed, which involved in three aspects: (a) preparation of high performance structural materials based on dynamic covalent bonds, (b) the relationship between dynamic covalent bonds and rheology behavior of materials, and (c) the combination of various dynamic bonds to prepare functional materials.

DE Innovation; technology; sustainability; recycling; discarded electronic

AB The world faces problems such as climate change and global warming caused by human activity. Therefore educators should have the responsibility to create awareness for the problems of electronic waste. Devices such as mobile phones contain environmental pollutants, heavy metals, dangerous chemical compounds as well as very rare and valuable resources. These resources are very difficult to recycle and therefore many broken or outdated electronic devices are thrown away. Students have to be aware of these problems and change their behaviours, and to act responsibly and in a sustainable way.
   In this paper, we present the concept of our project "Schrotty" (Schrott stands in German for waste) intended to find possible solutions to create this awareness and we will share results and lessons learnt from the first project year.
   Awareness can only be created if people understand the underlying technology. To achieve this, teachers have to provide students with appropriate situations and possibilities to learn about electronics. Also they should understand possibilities and problems of prototyping platforms, mobile devices and 3D-Printing.
   Two problems often reported are - especially in primary schools- the lack of knowledge of teachers about the technical background in physics, chemistry or electricity and the limited financial resources of schools. In our project, we bring together schools and organizations dealing with electronic waste. Therefore knowledge and resources can be provided by the participating companies and children learn about the work and goals of these companies.
   By using obsolete devices and electronic parts students can learn about the basics of electronics in a constructivist way by trial and error. Since abandoned electronic components are free of charge, students are able to learn from their mistakes without fearing consequences when something is broken.
   We have created an Internet platform to exchange pedagogical material as well as experience of teachers and students. We intend to start a process where organizations and teachers work together to develop courses and workshops to increase their knowledge on these topics as well as to create awareness. Students who participate in this project and who the results are aimed at are between 10 to 18 years old. The workshops can either be conducted in the fields of art (making decorations and jewellery out of broken or discarded electronic equipment), technology (reusing parts of abandoned devices for building e.g. robots, microphones and speakers) or didactics (students research and create learning materials about sustainability). With a special video platform we intend to give students the possibility to publish their experience and to motivate and help other students.

AB Purpose The main purpose of this paper is to explore innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain in the future by focusing on investigating the impacts of COVID-19 on the fashion supply chain and review sustainable supply chain. Design/methodology/approach A systematic literature review (SLR) and a case study have been undertaken to explore the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain developed after the COVID-19 outbreak. Having conducted a comprehensive literature search in electronic databases Google Scholar, Emerald Insight, ScienceDirect and ProQuest, 69 articles were selected and reviewed. A case of the Kering Group was used to explain the results. Findings This paper highlighted the basic concepts of a sustainable supply chain, reviewed the 10 principles of the United Nation Global Compact and their connections to promoting supply chain sustainability, as well as the three components of a sustainable supply chain: green supply chain, transparent supply chain and circular supply chain. Based on the results of a SLR and a real case of Kering Group, the paper identified 12 innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain: (1) biodegradable and natural materials, (2) textile recycling, (3) nearshoring, (4) artificial intelligence (AI), (5) robot, (6) 3D printing, (7) Internet of Things, (8) blockchain, (9) reverse resources; (10) bio-packaging, (11) augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and (12) digital runway. Research limitations/implications The epidemiological situations of the COVID-19 pandemic and the corresponding innovative ideas for a sustainable supply chain may change over time. While this paper provides a comprehensive literature review and case study, further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts in the development of a sustainable fashion supply chain through collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Practical implications Embracing the issues from the COVID-19 pandemic, the results of this study are further explained by the case of Kering Group in the fashion industry. The managerial implications of the results and discussion are the need to adopt innovative ideas for a more sustainable fashion supply chain in the future. The success of sustainable supply chains work by leveraging the best available technologies such as robot, 3D printing, AR and VR, setting consistent standards for sustainability such as Environmental Profit and Loss and Kering & Textile Exchange and communicating with all parties throughout the supply chain, such as blockchain and AI. Investment in developing technology and innovative ideas will be the key of future to supply chain sustainability. Nonetheless, the specific approach used by each organization must be tailored to its characteristics, goals and circumstances. Social implications Bringing upon unprecedented challenges, the pandemic has shown both companies and consumers just how fragile our planet is. Thus, to protect our planet in the long run, we need to not only make businesses more sustainable but also live more eco-friendly lifestyles. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first work that conducts a systemic review of the relevant academic journal articles addressed to the managerial audience on sustainable (fashion) supply chain. In addition, this paper also adds some consideration to this gap by exploring the innovative ideas for a sustainable fashion supply chain in the future and using a case to illustrate how these ideas can be put in a real-life context.
   This paper discusses the impact of COVID-19 on different stages of the supply chain and gives innovative ideas that can be used in response to the changing epidemiological situations of the pandemic.

AB Hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid (13-HPODE) can be obtained from safflower oil in an enzyme cascade utilizing lipase, lipoxygenase (LOX), and catalase for in situ oxygen generation. The application of immobilized enzymes may open a new path to a cost-efficient production of 13-HPODE, which is used for the synthesis of green note aroma hexanal. Ten immobilization supports are compared for immobilization of lipoxygenase-1 from Glycine max (LOX-1) and oxirane-based Immobead 150 P proves to be best with a maximum LOX-1 activity of 22 470 U g(-1). The immobilizate is successfully recycled in eight consecutive batches and maintains full activity over a period of 16 h using a 3D-printed column reactor. Catalase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus and LOX-1 are co-immobilized on Immobead 150 P allowing a constant production of 13-HPODE for up to six cycles with a maximum product conversion of 45% and a 13-regioselectivity of 83%. In this two-enzyme system with H2O2-dosage, foam generation is significantly reduced. Co-immobilization of LOX-1 and lipaseis possible; however, rapid lipase deactivation occurs. Therefore, a two-reactor approach with oil hydrolysis in the first reactor is proposed. Immobilized lipases from C. rugosa are suitable for safflower oil hydrolysis and maintain full activity over ten hydrolysis cycles.Practical applications: Linoleic acid hydroperoxide (13-HPODE) is the starting material for the synthesis of the green note aroma compound hexanal. The byproduct of the hydroperoxide splitting is omega-oxododecenoic acid, which is currently not employed industrially. The bifunctional oxodocecenoic acid is interesting as precursor for the synthesis of polymer building blocks. Simple one-step derivatization of the oxo-group can yield suitable C12 monomers such as dicarboxylic acids, omega-amino acids, or omega-hydroxy acids. Cost-efficiency is a key parameter to incorporate these new biobased building blocks for polymer applications. In this approach, immobilized enzymes are used for the synthesis of 13-HPODE starting from safflower oil with in situ oxygen generation to prevent excessive foam formation. A two-reactor concept is designed to circumvent hydroperoxide-induced lipase deactivation. Direct comparison of both batch and continuous process is performed and provides information for the implementation of the enzyme cascade and the design of an optimized reactor system.

AB Medical devices contribute to the carbon footprint generated by the healthcare sector. The development of implants and biomaterials using recycled waste materials promotes sustainable advances in tissue engineering. Additively manufactured (AM) bone-substituting biomaterials with multifunctional properties, e.g., biodegradability, antibacterial and osteogenic potential, can contribute to sustainable healthcare. Biodegradable biomaterials eliminate secondary surgeries to remove implants, reduce post-surgical complications, and enhance patient recovery, thus decreasing the energy usage and waste associated with medical treatments. Herein, we present porous iron (Fe) scaffolds incorporating 20 vol% waste-derived eggshell particles for bone substitution. The Fe-eggshell scaffolds were fabricated using direct ink writing (DIW) technique and underwent post-AM heat treatment. During sintering, the eggshell's main component - CaCO3, transformed into CaO. Atomic diffusion between alpha-Fe and CaO phases resulted in the formation of Ca2Fe2O5 phase at the interface. The scaffolds were 70 % porous and displayed a biodegradation rate of 0.11 mm/year. The mechanical properties were comparable to trabecular bone and the scaffolds endured 3 million loading cycles at 0.7 sigma(y) in r-SBF. The scaffolds showed apatite-forming ability, evidenced by the formation of (carbonaceous) hydroxyapatite, which are conducive to preosteoblast adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation. RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the osteogenic potential of the specimens as evidenced by the upregulated expression of osteopontin and osteocalcin as compared to Ti6Al4V controls. Furthermore, the scaffolds exhibited bactericidal activity (>3.9-log CFU reduction) against methicillin-sensitive and multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and delayed their biofilm formation. Our research showcases the exceptional multifunctionality of DIW Fe-eggshell composite scaffolds for the sustainable development of orthopedic biomaterials. Statement of significance We aim to improve the biofunctionalities and sustainability of biodegradable bone substitutes, by developing the extrusion-based 3D printed porous Fe composite scaffolds containing eggshell-derived CaO bioceramics. Our results demonstrated that Fe-eggshell scaffolds exhibited hydroxyapatite-forming ability in simulated body fluid, having mechanical properties in the range of trabecular bone even after 4 weeks biodegradation, supported the proliferation of preosteoblasts and upregulated the expression of osteogenic genes. Moreover, the scaffolds were bactericidal against methicillin-sensitive and multi-drug resistant strains Staphylococcus aureus and delayed their biofilm formation.

ID ANTIBACTERIAL; HEMOSTASIS
AB When skin injuries are healing, complex wound environments can be easily created, which can result in wound infection, excessive inflammation caused by neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory factors, and excessive reactive oxygen species, resulting in high levels of oxidative stress. As a result of these factors, cell membranes, proteins, DNA, etc. may become damaged, which adversely affects the repair function of normal cells around the wound, resulting in the formation of chronic wounds. The effectiveness of wound dressings as a treatment is well known. They can offer temporary skin damage protection, prevent or control wound infection, create an environment that is conducive to mending skin damage, and speed wound healing. Traditional dressings like gauze, cotton balls, and bandages, however, have the drawbacks of having no antimicrobial properties, having weak adhesive properties, having poor mechanical properties, being susceptible to inflammation, obstructing angiogenesis, needing frequent replacement, and being unable to create an environment that is conducive to wound healing. As an innovative bandage, self -assembled hydrogel has great water absorption, high water retention, superior biocompatibility, biodegradability and three-dimensional (3D) structure. With properties including hemostasis, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant, the synthesized raw material itself and the loaded active compounds have a wide range of potential applications in the treatment of skin injuries and wound healing. This research begins by examining and discussing the mechanism of cross -linking in self -assembled hydrogels. The cross -linking modes include non -covalent consisting of physical interaction forces such as electrostatic interactions, pi -stacking, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and metal-ligand bonds, covalent cross -linking formed by dynamic covalent bonding such as disulfide bonding and Schiff bases. And hybrid cross -linking with mixed physical forces and dynamic covalent bonding. The next part describes the special structure and excellent functions of self -assembled hydrogels, which include an extracellular matrix -like structure, the removal of exogenous microorganisms, and the mitigation of inflammation and oxidative stress. It goes on to explain the benefits of using self -assembled hydrogels as dressings for skin injuries. These dressings are capable of controlling cell proliferation, loading active ingredients, achieving hemostasis and coagulation, hastening wound healing, and controlling the regeneration of the injured area. The development of self -assembly hydrogels as dressings is summarized in the last section. The transition from purely non -covalent or covalent cross -linking to hybrid cross -linking with multiple networks, from one -strategy action to multi -strategy synergy in exerting antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects and from single -function to multi -functioning in a single product.
   Additionally, it is predicted that future developments in self -assembled hydrogels will focus on creating biomimetic gels with multi -strategy associations linkage from naturally self -assembling biomolecules peptides, lipids, proteins and polysaccharides; improving the properties and cross -linking of raw materials to enhance the storage capabilities of hydrogels and cross -linking techniques, realizing the recycling of hydrogels; conducting additional research and exploration into the cross -linking process of hydrogels; and realizing the gel's controllable rate of degradation. Furthermore, combining 3D printing and 3D microscopic imaging technology to design and build one-to-one specialized gel dressings; using computer simulation and virtual reality to eliminate the time factor, resulting in self -assembled hydrogels that perfectly fit the ideal dressing.

AB Currently, a range of industries is undergoing a major competitive shift away from unsustainable, energy and resource intensive high-tech to more resource efficient greentech products as a source of competitive advantage. This sustainability turn (although still sluggish in the automobile sector) will force the whole value chain, including small and medium sized suppliers, to diversify as the manufacturing of electric cars will need much less capacity and labour than the production of the combustion engine did and parts can increasingly be printed on demand using 3D printers. At the same time, this shift is characterized by inconsistencies that render this endeavour a particularly difficult one. Wind turbine and electric car manufacturers (considered the core sustainability transition industries), for instance, rely heavily on rare earth elements (Chen and Zheng, 2019) although these elements are at the same time highly risky ecologically due to the extraction of radioactive byproducts, emissions and high energy usage (Pell et al 2019). Therefore, the global sourcing of these sustainability transition industries (Markard, et al. 2012) is highly unsustainable.
   Although materials are central to the transition to more sustainable economies, the circularity implications of materials are currently often omitted from the discussion especially as regards design (Peck 2012). Complex materials (Fraunhofer Materials 2016) like plastics compounds used in a wide range of products from automobile parts to multi-layer packages pose particularly severe problems at the end of the use phase of products though. A higher sustainability level at the beginning of the value chain is therefore offset by a lower sustainability level at the end (due to highly complex waste streams) - hampering prolonged product usage and Recycling. Here is where an important role accrues to digitization and standardization in the transformation to sustainable value chains.
   The paper analyzes the sketched role of digitization and standardization on the materials/technology level and makes reference to the approach of technological innovation systems (Malhotra et al., 2019, Markard et al. 2012). On a practical level, materials recovered from end-of-life vehicles and post-consumer plastics waste serve as illustrative examples. Based on this, preliminary management implications (derived from the conceptual analysis and to be complemented by an empirical analysis in the mentioned sectors) are formulated for knowledge-based sustainable value chains in traditional industries "going circular".

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is a biodegradable aliphatic polyester obtained from renewable resources like corn and sugarcane. It has gained recognition as a viable sustainable substitute for fossil-based plastics in food packaging and biomedical applications. This review examines the physicochemical and biological characteristics of PLA, emphasizing its significantly reduced carbon footprint (up to 75 % lower than polyethylene terephthalate), impressive tensile strength (sigma m), and biocompatibility, establishing it as a prominent biomaterial. Recent developments in the synthesis of PLA, particularly through optimized ring-opening polymerization techniques, have significantly improved its mechanical characteristics and biodegradability. This progress is expected to result in a 30 % rise in demand for food packaging by the year 2025. The integration of food-derived additives such as fish gelatin, carvacrol, and lignin, along with natural oils including epoxidized soybean oil and ginger essential oil, as well as organic materials like bamboo fibers and cellulose nanocrystals, enhances the tensile strength of PLA by as much as 25 %, increases elongation at break (epsilon b) by up to 300 %, and improves barrier properties with a 30 % reduction in water vapor permeability. Additionally, the use of antimicrobial agents such as curcumin and zinc oxide nanoparticles can diminish bacterial growth by up to 99 %. Advanced processing techniques, including 3D printing, electrospinning, and melt extrusion, significantly improve the applicability of PLA in smart packaging and biomedical scaffolds. Notwithstanding these advancements, obstacles persist, such as insufficient data regarding additive migration, the durability over extended periods under diverse environmental conditions, and the scalability of methods developed in laboratory settings. This review highlights significant research gaps and suggests various recommendations, such as conducting dose-response studies, implementing standardized aging tests, performing techno-economic analyses, and executing thorough life cycle assessments (LCAs), to enhance the performance of PLA. Future investigations ought to concentrate on multifunctional PLA systems incorporating intelligent sensors, customized degradation profiles, and closed-loop recycling mechanisms to adhere to circular economy principles, thereby guaranteeing sustainable and highperformance solutions for food safety and biomedical applications.

AB Lignocellulosic biomass is an ideal feedstock for the next generation of sustainable, high-performance, polymeric materials. Although lignin is a highly available and low-cost source of natural aromatics, it is commonly burned for heat or disposed of as waste. The use of lignin for new materials introduces both challenges and opportunities with respect to incumbent petrochemical-based compounds. These considerations are derived from two fundamental aspects of lignin: its recalcitrant/heterogeneous nature and aromatic methoxy substituents. This Account highlights four key efforts from the Epps group and collaborators that established innovative methods/processes to synthesize polymers from lignin deconstruction products to unlock application potential, with a particular focus on the polymerization of biobased monomer mixtures, development of structure-property-processing relationships for diverse feedstocks, functional benefits of methoxy substituents, and scalability of lignin deconstruction.First, lignin-derivable polymethacrylate systems were probed to investigate the polymerization behavior of methacrylate monomers and predict thermomechanical properties of polymers from monomer mixtures. Notably, the glass transition temperatures (T gs) of lignin-derivable polymethacrylates (similar to 100-200 degrees C) were comparable to, or significantly above, those of petroleum-based analogues, such as polystyrene (similar to 100 degrees C), and the T gs of the complex, biobased copolymers could be predicted by the Fox equation prior to biomass deconstruction.Second, an understanding of structure-property relationships in polymethacrylates was applied to create performance-advantaged pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) using phenolic-rich bio-oil obtained from the reductive catalytic fractionation of poplar wood. The use of actual lignin-derived monomers as the starting material was an important step because it underscored that nanostructure-forming, multiblock polymers could be readily made despite the complexity of real lignin deconstruction products. This work also highlighted that lignin-based phenolics could be used to make colorless/odorless PSAs, without complex separations/purifications, and still perform as well as commercial adhesives.Third, an intensified reductive catalytic deconstruction (RCD) process was developed to deconstruct lignin at ambient conditions, and the deconstructed products were successfully employed in 3D printing. The reactive distillation-RCD process operated at ambient pressure using a low-volatility and biobased solvent (glycerin) as a hydrogen donor, which reduced capital/operating costs, energy use, and safety hazards associated with conventional RCD. Technoeconomic analysis showed that such optimization could lead to a 60% reduction in cost to make the PSAs described above.Fourth, lignin-derivable bisguaiacols/bissyringols were explored as potential alternatives to petroleum-derived bisphenol A (BPA) in diamine-cured epoxy resins. A distinguishing feature of the lignin monomers (vs. BPA/bisphenol F [BPF]) was the presence of methoxy groups on the aromatic rings, and these methoxy moieties enabled tuning of application-specific properties, such as T g, degradation temperature (T d), and glassy storage modulus (E '), to achieve improved processing and performance. The lignin-derivable thermosets exhibited T gs above 100 degrees C, T ds above 300 degrees C, and E ' s above 2 GPa, all values that were comparable to those of BPA-/BPF-based analogues.
   Moreover, the methoxy groups on these lignin-derivable compounds sterically hindered hormone receptor binding and could mitigate many of the toxicity concerns associated with BPA/BPF.This Account concludes with suggestions on future research needed to advance lignin-derived materials as sustainable and performance-advantaged alternatives by leveraging recycling/upcycling strategies and scaling-up/commercializing biomass waste.

AB Objective The compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) with asymmetric structures has the advantages of eliminating the shading phenomenon of array arrangement, reducing the center of gravity of the integrated system, and having small application site constraints. Additionally, the elimination of vacuum tube gap light leakage can recycle the light that should have escaped from the vacuum interlayer gap and improve the optical efficiency of the concentrator. Based on the existing no light escape CPCs (N-CPCs) with symmetric structures, we design a N- CPC with asymmetric structures, which further improves the optical efficiency of the shell- shaped CPC (SS- CPC) and eliminates the light leakage from its vacuum tube gap. However, the curved concentrating surface of the CPC results in uneven distribution of energy flow density on the heat- absorbing surface and thus a decrease in the efficiency of the photothermal/photovoltaic system, and is not conducive to long-term stable operation of the system. Meanwhile, the curved concentrating surface is expensive and difficult to transport and store, which is not favorable for realizing a wide range of applications. Thus, the construction of a concentrating surface composed of multiple planar mirrors can improve the inhomogeneous energy flow density distribution on the heat- absorbing surface, increase the operating time of the CPC, reduce the manufacturing cost of the concentrating surface, and improve the industrial application potential. Methods Based on the research results of the existing N-CPCs, we adopt the Monte Carlo ray tracing method and the principle of fringe ray, the geometric calculation method to derive the surface formula, and the design of the reflective surface to eliminate the light escape, and ultimately the mapping software to fit a novel N- CPC with asymmetric structures. Additionally, the 3D model of the concentrator is built to verify the existence of light escape via the optical simulation software. The no light escape multi- section CPC (NM- CPC) is constructed by screening the rotation angle with the smallest N- CPC isotropic planarization error based on program calculations, and the NM- CPC solid face shape is printed by a 3D printer. The reflective film and scale are pasted, and the solar rays are simulated by a laser to verify the reliability of the NM- CPC face structure and the correctness of the theoretical model. Meanwhile, the optical simulation software is employed to calculate the optical efficiency of the NM- CPC, and a program is written to calculate the energy flow density on the heat- absorbing surface and the amount of radiant energy collected in a typical meteorological year. Results and Discussions Inspired by the existing N-CPCs, we design an asymmetric N- CPC [Fig. 1(b)], which is simulated and verified to reflect the light escaping from the vacuum tube to the heat- absorbing surface to improve the optical efficiency of the concentrator system [Fig. 2(a)]. The NM- CPC heat- absorbing surface has more uniform energy flow density distribution and lower peak energy flow density ( Figs. 6 and 7), and superior radiant energy collection in Spring and Autumn (Fig. 8). Additionally, 4.73 mm increase in optical port width within the maximum acceptance angle (Fig. 9), and reflective surface consumables almost similar to SS- CPC, but at 1/4 of the cost (Fig. 10) are presented.
   Conclusions For N-CPCs with symmetric structures, we establish a N- CPC, and then construct a novel NM- CPC by isotropic planarization of curved reflective surfaces from the perspective of practical application engineering. Meanwhile, the solar vacuum tube is employed as the absorber, and the optical performance and energy concentration characteristics are analyzed and discussed by experiments and simulations. Finally, the following conclusions are drawn compared with the SS- CPC of the same specification. The simulation verifies the feasibility of N-CPCs to realize no light escape and provides references for the design of N-CPCs with asymmetric structures. The optical efficiency of NM-CPCs changes more gently at the maximum acceptance angle. The distribution of the energy flow density on the heat- absorbing surface is more uniform, and the peak energy flow density can be reduced by up to 39.1 kW/m2. Additionally, a better amount of radiant energy collection is shown in Spring and Autumn. The reflective surface of NM-CPCs not only saves 75 degrees o of the energy flow density but also reduces the energy flow density of the heat- absorbing surface. While saving 75.5 degrees o of the manufacturing cost, this surface features lower transportation and maintenance difficulties, and good engineering practicability.
