AB The increased use of plastics in industrial and agricultural applications has led to high levels of pollution worldwide and is a significant challenge. To address this plastic pollution, conventional methods such as landfills and incineration are used, leading to further challenges such as the generation of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, increasing interest has been directed to identifying alternative methods to dispose of plastic waste from agriculture. The novelty of the current research arose from the lack of critical reviews on how 3-Dimensional (3D) printing was adopted for recycling plastics, its application in the production of agricultural plastics, and its specific benefits, disadvantages, and limitations in recycling plastics. The review paper offers novel insights regarding the application of 3D printing methods including Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF), Hot Melt Extrusion (HME), and Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) to make filaments from plastics. However, the methods were adopted in local recycling setups where only small quantities of the raw materials were considered. Data was collected using a systematic review involving 39 studies. Findings showed that the application of the 3D printing methods led to the generation of agricultural plastics such as Polylactic Acid (PLA), Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET), and High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE), which were found to have properties comparable to those of virgin plastic, suggesting the viability of 3D printing in managing plastic pollution. However, limitations were also associated with the 3D printing methods; 3D-printed plastics deteriorated rapidly under Ultraviolet (UV) light and are non-biodegradable, posing further risks of plastic pollution. However, UV stabilization helps reduce plastic deterioration, thus increasing longevity and reducing disposal. Future directions emphasize identifying methods to reduce the deterioration of 3D-printed agricultural plastics and increasing their longevity in addition to UV stability.

AB This research explores the sustainability of recycling polymer composites using fused deposition modelling (FDM). The objective was to assess how different recycling cycles affect the mechanical integrity and energy efficiency of recycled polymers. The study employed quantitative assessments of tensile strength, energy consumption, and carbon emissions across multiple recycling cycles. Recycled materials were compared with virgin materials to establish a baseline for degradation and efficiency. Various additives were tested to evaluate their ability to stabilise material properties. Significant findings indicate that recycled polymers retain up to 90 % of their original tensile strength after the first cycle, declining to 80 % after three cycles. Energy usage during the recycling process decreased by 30 %, while the carbon footprint was reduced by 25 %, showcasing notable environmental benefits. The study confirms that FDM recycling of polymer composites can be optimised to achieve substantial sustainability benefits in terms of environmental impact and material preservation.

AB Due to their versatile properties and wide-ranging applications across various industries, including manufacturing, polymers are indispensable for today's society. However, polymer-based products significantly impact the environment since many are single-used plastics and require a long time to degrade naturally. A method to attenuate end-of-life polymers' ill effects is recycling them to bring them again into the production cycle, from grave to cradle. This investigation involves recycling PETG sheets used in face shield production during the COVID-19 outbreak to fabricate 3D printing filaments for FFF. We assessed poly(ethylene terephthalate) glycol (PETG) processability to up to five recycling cycles and obtained filaments with properties adequate for 3D printing. Rheological, thermal, morphological, and mechanical characterization were analyzed to verify the effect of the number of processing cycles on the properties of the polymer. The recycling cycles originated a decrease in viscosity and elasticity, and the gain in molecular mobility resulted, relatively, in solids with a higher degree of crystallinity and prints with more elliptical depositions. The mechanical properties of printed parts fabricated of recycled material were comparable to those from commercial filament, especially after three extrusion cycles. Both extrusion and additive manufacturing processes successfully recycle material into filaments and printed parts, indicating that the proposed methodology is a promising alternative to bring value back to polymers from solid waste.

AB This paper analysed the possibility of using recycled powders (<75 <mu>m) and recycling fine aggregates (<1.18 mm) obtained during the crushing and grinding of concrete waste (CoW), ceramic waste (CeW) and red clay brick waste (RCBW) when designing cementitious pastes and mortars for 3D printing. The effects of the type of powder (CoW-powder, CeW-powder and RCBW-powder) and of the liquid/solid (L/S) ratio on the mixture properties in the fresh and hardened states were studied. In the fresh state, the level of flowability (mini-slump), flow index (flow table), buildability and setting time characteristics of the cementitious pastes were evaluated. In addition, the rheological behaviour was analysed through a rotational rheometer. In the hardened state, the compressive strength was determined at 3, 7, 28 and 90 days. The effects of the type of recycled fine aggregate (RFA - CoW, RFA - CeW and RFA - RCBW) were evaluated for mortars with a cement:aggregate ratio of 1:0.5. Based on the results obtained, the most suitable mixtures were selected to carry out 3D printing tests on a laboratory scale. From the 3D printing of beam-type specimens, it was possible to determine the flexural and compressive strengths (28 days) of the selected mixtures. The results obtained validated the possibility of using recycled powders (CoW, CeW and RCBW) to replace 30 % of ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and to incorporate 100 % recycled fine aggregates in the design of cementitious materials (pastes and mortars) for 3D printing. In this regard, the recycled powders and recycled fine aggregates increase the buildability and thixotropy of cementitious mixtures. With an adjustment in the L/S (liquid/solids) ratio, their application in 3D printing becomes feasible. This alternative for the use of powders and fine aggregates from construction and demolition waste (CDW) could be considered a contribution towards the sustainability of the sector and the implementation of a circular economy.

AB The inefficient management of wastes recovered from electric and electronic apparatuses (the so-called WEEE or e-waste) has become a severe global concern in the last years, since the indiscriminate accumulation of wastes containing hazardous material poses serious risks for the environmental, as well as for the human health. Despite the continuous development of innovative and efficient technologies for the mechanical recycling of WEEE plastics, the effective re-utilization of these fractions is often limited by their poor value-added. In this work, we propose a strategy for the valorization of a typical WEEE plastic stream recovered from small appliances (mainly composed on polypropylene filled with talc particles) through the formulation of filaments suitable for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printing processes. Preliminary spectroscopic analyses on the WEEE plastics allowed separating the sample in two streams, according to the different content of talc. Both streams were first characterized from a rheological point of view, aiming at assessing their 3D printability. Then, the mechanical properties and the morphology of the filaments (obtained after a close optimization of the extrusion conditions) were evaluated; the obtained results indicated the achievement of a regular geometry and mechanical properties comparable to those of commercial filaments. Finally, 3D printed specimens showed a satisfactory quality in terms of resolution and definition, demonstrating the possibility of profitably enhancing the value-added of WEEE plastics, using them as feedstock to produce sustainable 3D printing filaments.

AB The outlook for space exploration, and the long-term sustainable presence of humans in space, rely upon the advancement of in -situ manufacturing capabilities. In -space additive manufacturing (AM) has gained significant attention due to its potential to produce spare parts in -situ and facilitate repairs for extending space missions. However, to date, there is no AM system capable of processing high-performance engineering thermoplastic polymers within uncontrolled space conditions (i.e., reduced gravity, vacuum, and radiation environment). Additionally, the effect of ultra -violet (UV) radiation on printed parts has remained unexplored. In this work, a custom-built filament extrusion AM breadboard has been developed and tested enabling the fabrication of engineering thermoplastic polymers, whereby the machine was placed inside a vacuum chamber to partly mimic the harsh space environment. Mechanical (tensile and flexural) and thermal (thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis) tests were conducted on the printed specimens before and after exposure to UV aging. Moreover, the printed geometries underwent a recycling process involved the shredding of the pristine 3D -printed polymeric samples, the drying of the obtained granulates and finally the extrusion of 3D -printable filaments. The polymeric recycled 3D -printed specimens were then subjected to further mechanical and thermal testing, offering valuable insights into the feasibility of in -space AM and the potential to augment the circularity of the printed parts. The results of the mechanical and thermal tests, together with the effect of vacuum printing, UV aging, and recycling, are provided within the manuscript. This work cements the basic building blocks to sustainably advance on -orbit and in -space infrastructure, and paves the way for longterm human space missions.

AB This perspective article describes the past, present, and future directions on TiO2 photocatalysis, 3D concrete printing, and recycling for developing innovative building envelope components from fa & ccedil;ade skins. Using a methodology consisting of three phases, first the historical evolution of TiO2 photocatalysis, 3D concrete printing, and recycling policies was investigated. Second, the rationale and positioning with regard to the state of the art were developed. Third, the cementitious mix design assessment for 3D printing of the building envelope components, evaluation of the photocatalytic activity, evaluation of the self-cleaning and air-purifying properties, and environmental and health assessment of the building envelope components were identified and discussed as major issues in developing innovative building envelope components that have the potential to mitigate urban air pollution, reduce building maintenance activities, and reduce building embedded carbon while, for example, recycling significant amounts of construction and demolition waste.

DT Article
ID ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT WEEE; PLASTIC WASTE
AB Recycling waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) for valuable materials is a critical aspect of the circular economy and sustainable waste management. Recycling these solid wastes into value-added products is one method for reducing landfill waste and pollution. The purpose of this research was to investigate the recyclability of plastic wastes of Polycarbonate Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene blends with Brominated Flame-Retardant additives (PC-ABS-FR). Two types of plastic wastes, PC-ABS-FR (GL) and PC-ABS-FR (DB), were collected and converted into polymer chips using a mechanical process. To study the effectiveness of waste recyclability, 3D printing filaments were produced through the extrusion process. Chemical elements, functional groups, and thermal and mechanical properties of recycled products were evaluated using EDX, FTIR, DSC, and universal tensile testing equipment, respectively. TGA, cone calorimetry, and melt flow index analyses were also carried out. The results showed that recycled PC- ABS-FR (GL) waste-based filament samples had better thermal and mechanical properties. On the contrary, PC- ABS-FR (DB) waste recyclability was not effective in filament extrusion. The mechanical properties of the 3D printing filaments produced from PC-ABS-FR electronic waste were found to be similar to those observed in commercially available and previously reported filaments. The strength, thermal property, cross-sectional homogeneity, and filament diameter of 1.8 +/- 0.03 mm of the 3D printer filament made from PC- ABS-FR (GL) were suitable for 3D printing applications such as children's toys, dust bins, and flower vases.

AB Polymer membranes employed in gas separation play a pivotal role in advancing environmental sustainability, energy production, and gas purification technologies. Despite their significance, the current design and manufacturing of these membranes lack cradle-to-cradle approaches, contributing to plastic waste pollution. This study explores emerging solutions, including the use of biodegradable biopolymers such as polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and membrane recycling, with a focus on the specific impact of mechanical recycling on the performance of biodegradable gas separation membranes. This research represents the first systematic exploration of recycling biodegradable membranes for gas separation. Demonstrating that PHB membranes can be recycled and remanufactured without solvents using hot-melt extrusion and 3D printing, the research highlights PHB's promising performance in developing more sustainable CO2 separations, despite an increase in gas permeability with successive recycling steps due to reduced polymer molecular weight. The study emphasizes the excellent thermal, chemical, and mechanical stability of PHB membranes, albeit with a marginal reduction in gas selectivity upon recycling. However, limitations in PHB's molecular weight affecting extrudability and processability restrict the recycling to three cycles. Anticipating that this study will serve as a foundational exploration, we foresee more sophisticated recycling studies for gas separation membranes, paving the way for a circular economy in future membrane technologies.

AB As global concerns about climate change and resource scarcity grow, the need for sustainable practices in manufacturing is becoming increasingly important. 3D printing, a rapidly developing technology, has the potential to mitigate environmental impacts by reducing material waste and enabling decentralised production. This article investigates the sustainability of 3D printing filament recycling, focusing on achieving net-zero emissions. We analyse the environmental impact, energy consumption, and potential for reducing waste in filament recycling and provide recommendations for improving sustainability. Recycling these filaments has been identified as a potential solution to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated. This paper explores the concept of achieving net zero on 3D printing filament recycling, focusing on the sustainable analysis of the process. A literature review was conducted to understand the current state of 3D printing filament recycling and the challenges of achieving net zero. The review was supplemented with interviews with industry experts to gain a more in-depth understanding of the challenges and potential solutions. The results show that achieving net zero on 3D printing filament recycling is possible. However, it requires a holistic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of the filament. The paper discusses the implications of achieving net zero on 3D printing filament recycling for sustainability and the circular economy.

AB Due to the rapid expansion of the electronics sector, e-waste is becoming a growing issue that requires immediate attention. In particular, the complex assemblies and miniaturisation of these devices makes it difficult to recycle them properly. Additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing, offers a potential solution to this problem. The ability to print structures in mu m- range makes it possible to print and manufacture electronic components in such a way that predetermined breaking points can be incorporated. Parts printed in this way are subject to the concept of Design for Disassembly, which describes the production of multi-material compounds or composites that can be easily separated or recycled. Using a multi-material approach in combination with Thermally Expandable Microspheres (TEMs) and processed by 3D printing, we produced easily separable compounds on demand. The compounds were characterized regarding their (thermo)mechanical behaviour. The study investigated the influence of the printed separation layer on the mechanical properties of the overall compound for various layer orientations. The printed parts were separated using heat as an external impulse, without requiring extensive force. This was achieved by subjecting the parts to a temperature of 200 degrees C for 10 minutes in a conventional oven.

AB Low-density polyethene (LDPE) is extensively used in single-end-use food packaging and contributes significantly to global waste plastic. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a sustainable approach to reclaim and valorise waste LDPE from milk packaging by converting them into 3D printing filaments. The process involves extruding shredded LDPE pouches into continuous filaments using a modified thermal extruder. The research comprehensively investigates the effects of two key extrusion parameters, nozzle temperature and screw speed, on the resulting filament's physical and mechanical properties. Characterisation efforts include dimensional analysis, morphological evaluation, chemical integrity assessment, thermal stability analysis, and tensile testing. The results show that filaments remain consistently close to 1.75 mm diameter, which is required by most commercial FDM 3D printers. The filaments are chemically intact, thermally stable, and have high toughness across the range of extrusion parameters. The results and a preliminary demonstration of 3D printing indicate that the LDPE waste can be effectively transformed into consistent filaments that have the potential for 3D printing. A carbon footprint assessment underscores the environmental benefits of this approach, showing substantial reductions in estimated CO2 emissions compared to conventional filament production methods. While challenges related to the quality of printed parts remain, the research opens avenues for optimizing 3D printing parameters and exploring multiple recycling cycles. This work represents a step towards sustainable plastic waste management and offers insights into transforming single-use plastic items into valuable resources.

AB This work investigates the sustainable reuse of expanded polystyrene (EPS) waste through a multi-cycle physical recycling process involving dissolution in acetone and subsequent manufacturing via Direct Ink Write (DIW) 3D printing and casting. Morphology and mechanical properties were evaluated as a function of the manufacturing technique and number of dissolution cycles. Morphological analysis revealed that casted specimens better replicated the target geometry, while voids in 3D-printed specimens aligned with the printing direction due to rapid solvent evaporation. These voids contributed to slightly reduced stiffness in 3D-printed specimens compared to casted ones, particularly for transverse printing orientation. The defoaming process during dissolution significantly increased the density of the material, as well as removed low molecular weight additives like plasticizers, leading to a notable enhancement in stiffness. Successive dissolution cycles led to increased removal of plasticizers, enhancing stiffness up to 52 times (cast), 42 times (longitudinally printed), and 35 times (transversely printed) relative to as-received EPS waste. The glass transition temperature remained unchanged, confirming the preservation of polymer integrity. This work highlights the potential of EPS inks for sustainable, multi-cycle recycling, combining enhanced mechanical performance with the flexibility of 3D printing for complex, cost-effective designs, aligning with circular economy principles.

AB 3D printing is a promising technology for recycling agricultural waste by liquid deposition modeling (LDM). In this paper, we propose a novel method for recycling agricultural waste to be used in liquid deposition 3D printing. The method involves converting agricultural waste into suitable powder by grinding and sieving procedures. Then, a paste is prepared based on the powder from agricultural waste, which is then subjected to mechanical and physical testing to study its properties. A 3D printing setup is used to print samples for applying mechanical testing to study the properties of 3D-printed agricultural waste. The results of the mechanical and physical testing showed that the agricultural waste paste has promising properties for 3D printing.

AB The increasing awareness in environmental safety has led to rapid development in production of electricity using wind energy with wind turbines. The widespread deployment of wind turbines has outpaced the effective recycling of End-of-Life wind turbines. This study explores the potential of mechanically recycling decommissioned wind turbine blades (WTB) as reinforcement material in 3D printing processes. Utilizing mechanical grinding, materials were extracted from the waste blades and subsequently analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Differential scanning calorimetry, and thermogravimetric analysis to determine optimal processing conditions. The reclaimed materials were then blended with recycled polypropylene through single-screw extrusion to fabricate tensile test samples via Fused Deposition Modeling. The impact of print orientation on mechanical strength was examined at 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90 degrees angles. Morphological analysis was conducted on the fractured specimens to assess the failure characteristics. The findings indicate that samples printed at a 90 degrees orientation exhibited superior mechanical properties, suggesting a viable pathway for incorporating wind turbine waste into sustainable manufacturing cycles.Highlights A decentralized-mechanical recycling technique to the waste WTB.

AB The use of polymer materials in various fields has increased significantly due to their ease of thermoforming and relatively low production costs. The production volume of these materials is extremely high, and according to forecasts from global statistical centers, it is expected to continue rising in the future. However, the extensive use and easy availability of polymeric materials have caused significant ecological problems. The world faces large amounts of polymer waste and environmental pollution. Plastic recycling remains challenging due to issues related to sorting polymer waste and separating it according to polymer types. Recycling certain plastics requires only a quarter of the energy needed to produce new plastic. To address this, circular economy principles should be applied to 3D printing products made from polymeric materials. A particularly wide application of these technologies is found when polymeric materials are used due to their low cost, low melting temperatures, and other advantageous properties. This paper investigates the impact of plastic recycling on the quality of 3D-printed products. During the research, samples were 3D printed and tested using both virgin and recycled PLA, ABS, and PET-G materials. The samples underwent static and dynamic tests to determine their mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, elongation, and impact resistance. The research results showed that the properties of recycled polymer materials deteriorate, with relative elongation of recycled and 3D-printed materials decreased by 16-45%. Despite this, recycled polymer materials can still be used, but it is necessary to account for the reduction in plasticity when creating products that will be exposed to dynamic loads. The impact strength is reduced by 6% for PLA, 54% for ABS, and 58% for PET-G. Additionally, the research included tests on samples printed with 3D printing technology that were exposed to UV irradiation. The results indicated similar dependences, as UV exposure also affects the reduction of material plasticity. After 66 Wh/m2 of UV radiation, the tensile strength of PET-G and PLA decreased by 17%, while ABS showed a reduction of about 5%.

AB The concept of the circular economy has emerged as a promising solution to address the mounting concerns surrounding plastic waste and the urgent need for sustainable resource management. While conventional centralized recycling remains a common practice for plastic waste, centralized facilities may prove inadequate in handling the ever-increasing volumes of plastic waste generated globally. Consequently, exploring alternative recycling methods, such as distributed recycling by additive manufacturing, becomes paramount. This innovative approach encompasses actively involving communities in recycling practices and promotes a circular economy. This comprehensive review paper aims to explore the critical aspects necessary to realize the potential of distributed recycling by additive manufacturing. In this paper, our focus lies on proposing schemes that leverage existing literature to harness the potential of distributed recycling by additive manufacturing as an effective approach to plastic waste management. We explore the intricacies of the recycling process, optimize 3D printing parameters, address potential challenges, and evaluate the mechanical properties of recycled materials. Our investigation draws heavily from the literature of the last five years, as we conduct a thorough critical assessment of DRAM implementation and its influence on the properties of 3D printing structures. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal the potential of recycled materials in delivering functional components, with insights into their performance, strengths, and weaknesses. This review serves as a comprehensive guide for those interested in embracing distributed recycling by additive manufacturing as a transformative approach to plastic recycling. By fostering community engagement, optimizing 3D printing processes, and incorporating suitable additives, it is possible to collectively contribute to a more sustainable future while combatting the plastic waste crisis. As progress is made, it becomes essential to further delve into the complexities of material behavior, recycling techniques, and the long-term durability of recycled 3D printed components. By addressing these challenges head-on, it is feasible to refine and advance distributed recycling by additive manufacturing as a viable pathway to minimize plastic waste, fostering a circular economy and cultivating a cleaner planet for generations to come.

AB The boom in 3D printing has revolutionized manufacturing capabilities across all industries, offering unprecedented flexibility, adaptability and, last but not least, efficiency. However, the wide use of thermoplastic materials in the rapid prototyping process represents a significant environmental challenge due to the number of individual prototypes and the resulting accumulation of plastic waste. This article explores the potential of recycling thermoplastics in the industry as a means of promoting sustainable innovation. By integrating recycled thermoplastic materials into the production cycle, it is possible to reduce waste. The article deals with the possibilities of recycling thermoplastics and its influence on the mechanical properties of recycled thermoplastics. As the industry moves towards more sustainable manufacturing practices, the importance of recycled thermoplastics not only in the 3D printing industry will be key to creating a greener and more responsible future.

AB In 3D printing process using fused deposition modeling (FDM), filaments are used, including polylactic acid (PLA), coming from sugar cane or corn, which is melted during printing to form parts in three-dimensional layers. However, with the growing demand for 3D printing in different sectors of society, the trend is towards irregular disposal and the accumulation of this material in the form of waste. Therefore, we aim to reuse 3D printing waste made from PLA through mechanical recycling conversion. To this end, we held a 3D printing waste recycling workshop with High School and Higher students from the Instituto Federal do Amazonas Campus Manaus Distrito Industrial (IFAM CMDI). During the workshop, we asked students about 3D printing and sustainability and taught a class on the basics of 3D printing and recycling their waste. Later, the students used the single-screw extruder to form the PLA filament that can be used again in a new print. The students learned how to develop filaments for 3D printers, combining Environmental Education and Professional and Technological Education, stimulating learning and making them makers, manufacturing their own material, being able, in the long term, to undertake and work in this area. Therefore, with this PLA recycling workshop, we promote the circular economy, so that products and materials are reused, increasing their useful life and reducing waste.

AB There is a growing need to address waste generated from Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printing activities. This study explores the mechanical recycling of waste polylactic acid (PLA) accumulated from failed 3D printing operations and PLA biocomposite filaments containing nanocellulose fibres. FFF 3D printable filaments were produced via melt mixing and extrusion of virgin PLA containing varying amounts of waste PLA. The chemical, thermal and thermomechanical characterisation of each specimen was evaluated using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), simultaneous thermal analysis (SDT), dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and uniaxial tensile analysis (UTA). A desktop FFF 3D printer was used to fabricate UTA and DMA test specimens. The thermal stability of the filament specimens containing waste derived from the failed 3D prints were comparable with that of the commercial filaments. However, a 11% decrease in the onset of thermal degradation is observed for the filament containing waste biocomposites. The specimens containing waste PLA exhibited higher crystallinity and storage modulus. UTA results revealed similar tensile strength and % elongation, except for the specimen containing 50% waste PLA which exhibited a 29% decrease in tensile strength. This work successfully demonstrates mechanical recycling as a viable waste management strategy for waste materials generated during FFF 3D printing.
   Mechanical recycling of PLA-based waste materials obtained from 3D printing offers a viable alternative to incineration and landfill disposal. Use of recycled materials also results in reduction of cost and carbon footprint of the final product and alignment to circular economy principles. This study explores mechanical recycling of waste polylactic acid (PLA) generated during filament production and failed 3D prints.image

AB Rigid3D printing materials often get defects such as cavities,voids, holes, or gaps when suffering from impact forces. Fast self-healingof these damages without bulk temperature increase is always desired.Besides, the recycling of dynamically cross-linked polymers was usuallyfocused on solvent- or heat-assisted strategies such as compressionmolding and dissolution-casting, which restricts the geometrical diversityof recycled materials and may cause environmental issues. Here wereport a rigid photocuring 3D printing material that can heal itscave-like damage quickly under UV light based on the dynamic ureabond. Besides, after grounding the printed objects into powders anddirectly refilling them into new printing resin, the re-3D printedobjects show similar mechanical properties to the original materialswithout any post-treatment.

ID FATIGUE LIFE PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR; MODEL
AB High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is a highly versatile plastic utilized in various applicative fields such as packaging, agriculture, construction, and consumer goods. Unfortunately, the extensive use of polyethylene has resulted in a substantial accumulation of plastic waste, creating environmental and economic challenges. Consequently, the recycling of polyethylene has become a critical concern in recent times. This work focuses on the recycling of HDPE parts recovered from end-of-life boats into materials suitable for the marine environment with additive manufacturing technology via screw-assisted extrusion 3D printing. In particular, rigid materials are obtained by adding glass fibers to HDPE to mitigate the loss of mechanical performance upon recycling. Eventually, the properties obtained with two different production methods were compared, namely compression molding and screw-assisted extrusion 3D printing. Since the developed materials will be exposed to an aggressive environment, an extended thermos-mechanical characterization (including fatigue resistance) and investigation of the stability to UV exposure were performed.

AB Fused filament fabrication (FFF) based additive manufacturing (AM) process is a widely used and emerging manufacturing process for polymer-based products. The recycled filaments are realized through wastage generated while extruding the constant diameter feedstock filament, which is otherwise dumped in landfills or incinerated, releasing hazardous and toxic gases that influence the ecological environment. The wastage of these filaments can be eliminated by recycling and reusing them, addressing materials circular economy effectively, presented in this paper. The functionalized MWCNT reinforced HDPE (high-density polyethylene) nanocomposite (NC) is realized through a brabender, which is further used for filament extrusion. The waste/unrecycled (W/UR) and the recycled filaments are checked for quality. The density of the recycled filaments increases compared to the W/UR filament in each extrusion pass. The crystallinity and tensile properties of the recycled filaments increase compared to the W/UR filament with each additional extrusion cycle. Further, these filaments are used for 3D printing, and investigated for density, XRD and tensile tests. It is observed that the density, crystallinity and tensile properties of the recycled prints increase compared to the W/UR print. The tensile strength and modulus of 1 x , 2 x and 3 x prints are 63.82, 67.11 and 67.76%, and 45.63, 55.34 and 97.81% respectively, higher than those of the W/UR print. The highest tensile strength and modulus are observed for 3 x print which is 67.76 and 97.81% respectively, higher than those of the W/UR print. 3D prints exhibited enhanced performance as compared to their respective filaments. Finally, the present tensile results are mapped on a property chart, and compared with the available HDPE composites.

AB The current high production of plastics has prompted the exploration of alternative pathways to facilitate recycling, aiming for a progressively sustainable society. This paper presents an alternative and affordable technology for treating waste expanded polystyrene (EPS) mixed with acetone in a 100:1 volume ratio to be used as 3D printing ink for Direct Ink Write technology. In order to optimize the printing parameters, a comprehensive study was conducted, evaluating different needle diameters, printing speeds, and bed temperature values to achieve homogenous pieces and a highly repeatable 3D printing process. Results showed that the main optimum printing parameters were using needles with diameters of 14 to 16 G and printing speeds ranging from 2 to 12 mm/s, which were found to yield the most uniform ribbons. Increasing the bed temperature, despite favoring acetone evaporation, led to the generation of more heterogeneous structures due to void growth inside the printed ribbons. Thus, employing room temperature for the bed proved to be the optimal value. Lastly, a comparative study between the starting material and the EPS after the printing process was conducted using FTIR-ATR and GPC analyses, ensuring the preservation of the original polymer's integrity during physical recycling.

AB Clay is of great interest as a 3D printing material thanks to its ease of use, recyclability and reusability. This paper analyses the technical aspects of the whole printing process. The behaviour of 3D printing clay is studied with respect to the environment and its specific application as a temporary or definitive formwork system for cement parts. The study addresses the performance of clay and the loss of its properties and characteristics according to the type of protection, whether it is in direct contact with air or cement, or protected with plastics, metal sheets, or combinations of both. A 3D printing system with various printers and 3D models has been considered, observing a direct relationship between the prototype shape, extrusion process and resulting material. The most important variables in 3D printing have been considered: layer height, line thickness, base definition, total model height, overhang angles, overlap between layers, etc. The main technical aspects have been analysed such as raw material properties, kneading, process control, post-treatments and material hardening. As a natural material, clay can be reused indefinitely under certain conditions to be part of a circular economy with low energy consumption and minimal resources. It is concluded that the option of using ceramics in 3D printing for very diverse uses in the architecture, engineering & construction (AEC) sector is very promising due to their ease of implementation, recycling capability and suitability to different environments.

AB In this work, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) copolymer from electronic waste (e-waste) was used to produce filaments for application in 3D printing. Recycled ABS (rABS) from e-waste was blended with virgin ABS (vABS) in different concentrations. By differential scanning calorimetry, it was observed that the values of the glass transition temperatures for vABS/rABS blends ranged between the values of vABS and rABS. Torque rheometry analysis showed that the processability of vABS was not compromised with the addition of rABS. Rheological measurements showed that the viscosity of vABS was higher than that of rABS at low frequencies and indicated that vABS and rABS are immiscible. Impact strength (IS) tests of the 3D printed samples showed an increase in the IS with an increase in the rABS content up to 50 wt%. Blending vABS with rABS from e-waste is promising and proved to be feasible, making it possible to recycle a considerable amount of plastics from e-waste and, thus, contributing to the preservation of the environment.

AB Virgin polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is widely used in numerous engineering and biomedical applications, hence requiring a scientific recycling solution to achieve the sustainable development goals of the United Nations. However, less has been stated on the effect of secondary (2 degrees) recycling of PVDF to ensure the 3D printing of functional sensors. This study compares virgin and 2 degrees recycled PVDF composite prepared by mechanical reinforcement (by wt.%) of 8% hydroxyapatite (HAp), and 2% chitosan (CS) with a single screw extruder (SSE) for the 3D printing of functional sensors. The 2 degrees recycled PVDF composite was compared with virgin PVDF based on mechanical, flow, thermal, surface characteristics, and dielectric properties. The study outlines that 2 degrees recycled PVDF composite may be used for the 3D printing of functional sensor prototypes with an improvement of Young's modulus (E) (45%), viscosity (122.6%), and surface roughness (Ra) (6.79%) for the selected composition. However, the modulus of toughness (MOT) was significantly reduced (88.37%). Overall thermal and dielectric properties have shown little variation after 2 degrees recycling.

AB There are considerable amounts of plastic waste generated in university campuses which led to seriously consider achieving sustainability with waste recycling. Digital manufacturing technologies are offering approaches to convert plastic waste into materials to produce new products. There is a need to identify appropriate strategies for recycling plastic waste. This paper aims at identifying them in a university campus using a participatory approach. The Delphi technique is utilized as a group judgement in the workshop conducted at Assiut university campus. The specific findings of this paper include that university community has identified litter bins, educational models, and lighting fixtures as the most popular 3D-printed products made from recycled plastic bottles. When determining the affordable prices of recycled 3D-printed products, the time spent creating them and the amount produced were found to be the most important factors among the top five. On the university campus, the top five locations for collecting plastic waste were found to be next to sales outlets and on pedestrian paths at road intersections. Regarding the collection of PET plastic bottles, empty bottles and clean bottles were the two most preferred conditions out of the top five. Five locations are identified for mobile-lab awareness tours.

AB The recycling of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) reinforced graphite through material extrusion (MEX) has been widely reported. But hitherto little has been reported on the recycling of PVDF-graphite composite using 3D gel printing. This study compares the sensing, dielectric, and mechanical properties of PVDF-reinforced graphite by 3D gel printing and the MEX (based on insertion loss (S21), return loss (S11), dielectric constant (epsilon r), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis). The study suggests that for recycled PVDF composite (with 50% graphite by wt.), 3D gel printing outsailed the MEX process as the peak load (PL), peak strength (PS), and epsilon r were improved by 48.49%, 264%, and 65.37% respectively. As regards crystallinity (%) and Young's modulus (E), a reduction of 13.11%, and 72.22% was noticed with 3D gel-printed components.

AB 3D printing PLA wastes were recovered from a well-known reference grade and from different sources. The recovered wastes were subjected to an energic washing step and then reprocessed into films by melt-extrusion, followed by compression molding to simulate the industrial processing conditions. The obtained materials were characterized and the optical, structural, thermal and crystallization behavior are reported. The mechanical recycling process leads to an increase of the crystallinity and a decrease of the intrinsic viscosity of the formulations, particularly in the sample based on blends of different 3D-PLA wastes. Moreover, the obtained films were disintegrated under composting conditions in less than one month and it was observed that recycled materials degrade somewhat faster than the starting 3D-PLA filament, as a consequence of the presence of shorter polymer chains. Finally, to increase the molecular weight of the recycled materials, the 3D-PLA wastes were submitted to a solid-state polymerization process at 110, 120, and 130 degrees C, observing that the recycled 3D-wastes materials based on a well-known reference grade experiences an improvement of the intrinsic viscosity, while that coming from different sources showed no significant changes. Thus, the results show that 3D printing PLA products provides an ideal environment for the implementation of distributed recycling program, in which wastes coming from well-known PLA grades can successfully be processed in films with good overall performance.

AB This review aims to provide an overview of sustainable approaches that can be incorporated into well-known procedures for the development of materials, pre- and post-treatments, modifications, and applications of 3D-printed objects, especially for fused filament fabrication (FFF). Different examples of conductive and non-conductive bespoke filaments using renewable biopolymers, bioplasticizers, and recycled materials are presented and discussed. The main final characteristics of the polymeric materials achieved according to the feedstock, preparation, extrusion, and treatments are also covered. In addition to recycling and remanufacturing, this review also explores other alternative approaches that can be adopted to enhance the sustainability of methods, aiming to produce efficient and environmentally friendly 3D printed products. Adjusting printing parameters and miniaturizing systems are also highlighted in this regard. All these recommended strategies are employed to minimize environmental damage, while also enabling the production of high-quality, economical materials and 3D printed systems. These efforts align with the principles of Green Chemistry, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), and Circular Economy concepts.

AB Recent research and initiatives increasingly propose a new approach, based on distributed plastic recycling for open-source (OS) 3D printing technologies, as a way to deal with the issue of plastic waste and to support the development of the circular economy (CE). Distributed recycling can be thought of as a sort of "smart grid", composed of small and coordinated recycling units. However, the operational complexity of this distributed approach limits its application. Furthermore, the environmental and economic advantages have yet to be demonstrated. This article therefore explores the economic and environmental feasibility of this distributed plastic recycling approach from a logistics perspective, as a step towards its validation. To achieve this, an optimization mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was used as an evaluation tool, representing a local closed loop supply chain (CLSC) network. The proposed model is illustrated using a case study of a university seeking to implement a distributed recycling demonstrator in order to recover 3D printing wastes from secondary schools in the northeast of France. Following this step, a sensitivity analysis was carried out considering the market variations (price of virgin plastic filament) and the amount of available plastic waste derived from the schools. The results obtained show positive economic and environmental benefits of carrying out this new method of plastic recycling. This work serves as a basis for continuing to explore the feasibility and replication of the distributed plastic recycling network in other contexts.

AB Plastic waste is one of the major challenges of our times. With a global recycling rate of only 9 % and a continuous rise in plastic production, it is crucial to explore solutions to mitigate this problem. Mechanical recycling of plastic materials is one of the most accessible and widely used methods to recover thermoplastic polymers. In this study, a short-carbon-fiber-reinforced polyamide is mechanically recycled and recovered through Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) 3D printing to print new parts. Chemical and mechanical analyses are conducted to investigate possible molecular alterations due to the recycling process, evaluating the effectiveness of the simplest recovery system. Additionally, FGF and Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) are compared to assess any significant difference between the two technological solutions. Chemical analyses show no substantial difference in the chemical and physical properties of pristine and recycled material. However, micro-CT scans and tensile tests show notable differences between FGF and FFF technologies in microstructure and mechanical properties. Recycled specimens result 24 % and 6 % denser than FFF and FGF pristine respectively (having the same volume). This results in a maximum increase in stiffness (up to 43 %) and ultimate strength (up to 20 %) for recycled dogbone specimens. Besides minor microstructural aspects, no relevant differences are found between pristine and recycled material printed using FGF. A case study on sandwich cores is presented showing the feasibility of the recycling process. Due to its higher density, the recycled core performs 26 % lower in energy absorption when compared to pristine ones at the same weight.

AB The in situ resource utilization of lunar regolith is of great significance for the development of planetary materials science and space manufacturing. The material extrusion deposition approach provides an advanced method for fabricating polylactide/lunar regolith simulant (PLA/CLRS-1) components. This work aims to fabricate 3D printed PLA-lunar regolith simulant (5 and 10 wt.%) components using the material extrusion 3D printing approach, and realize their solvent dissolution recycling process. The influence of the lunar regolith simulant on the mechanical and thermal properties of the 3D printed PLA/CLRS-1 composites is systematically studied. The microstructure of 3D printed PLA/CLRS-1 parts was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (XCT) analysis. The results showed that the lunar regolith simulant can be fabricated and combined with a PLA matrix utilizing a 3D printing process, only slightly influencing the mechanical performance of printed specimens. Moreover, the crystallization process of PLA is obviously accelerated by the addition of CLRS-1 because of heterogeneous nucleation. Additionally, by using gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) characterization, it is found that the 3D printing and recycling processes have a negligible influence on the chemical structure and molecular weight of the PLA/CLRS-1 composites. As a breakthrough, we successfully utilize the lunar regolith simulant to print components with satisfactory mechanical properties and confirm the feasibility of recycling and reusing 3D printed PLA/CLRS-1 components via the solvent dissolution recycling approach.

AB 3D printing technology has emerged as a high value-added industry with high efficiency that has dramatically broken away from the existing material and manufacturing industry's human-based production system. These technologies, ranging from small parts to large structures, are rapidly developing due to the challenge of various filament materials, whereas there are significant concerns about waste filler materials, and complimentary research is needed to improve them. Polylactic acid (PLA), the representative polymer of 3D printing, contributes to minimizing environmental risks. However, although thermoplastic PLA has excellent reversible properties for heat in terms of sustainable resources, it is degraded as a low value-added material afterward. Therefore, in this study, the effect of repetitive recycling on the mechanical and thermal properties of PLA filaments was analyzed to verify and re-evaluate PLA as a renewable resource. As a result, recycled PLA has decreased tensile and flexural strength by up to 69% and 53%, respectively, compared to initial neat PLA with the increase of the number of repetitive recycling, and this demonstrates the change in the thermal properties of recycled PLA.

AB 3D printing services are an increasingly popular offering in many academic library makerspaces. However, failed prints, and simply the printing process itself, can generate substantial waste. Through a grant from a regional library consortium, the feasibility of recycling waste 3D plastic and reconstituting it into new 3D printing filament was explored and tested. Other 3D printing makerspaces on campus have asked about recycling waste filament or providing that material to the library to recycle. This paper will discuss the methodology, benefits, and challenges of recycling 3D printing filament in an effort to make 3D printing more sustainable.

AB This study examined the reuse of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (RPET) from different PET sources as feedstock material for 3D printing. The filament for 3D printing was made using virgin PET pellets (VPET-P), RPET pellets (RPET-P), and commercially available RPET flakes (RPET-CF). The effect of different printing temperatures (250 degrees C, 260 degrees C, and 270 degrees C) on the physio-mechanical properties of 3D-printed samples was studied, and the properties were compared with those of 3D-printed VPET-P samples. The density analysis showed that VPET-P had optimal values at 260 degrees C (1.12 g/cm3). RPET-P and RPET-CF showed higher densities at 270 degrees C, which improved compaction. Higher temperatures reduced shrinkage in RPET samples, with warpage decreasing to 0.347 mm for RPET-P and 0.559 mm for RPET-CF at 270 degrees C. Surface roughness improved with increasing printing temperature, with the best results for RPET samples at 260 degrees C. Mechanical testing showed that RPET-CF performed best, especially at 270 degrees C, with the highest Young's modulus of 1354 MPa, yield stress of 27.9 MPa, and tensile strength of 47.3 MPa. This was attributed to increased crystallinity and molecular orientation. RPET-CF also showed the highest hardness of 79 SHD and strong flexural properties, making it suitable for rigid applications. Microscopy showed fewer layer delamination and voids in RPET-CF compared to the brittle fractures observed in VPET-P and RPET-P. RPET-CF proved to be a promising material for structural 3D printing applications. Higher temperatures enhance its interlayer bonding, rigidity, and durability, making it suitable for load-bearing uses in additive manufacturing.

AB As a way of recycling epoxy thermoset materials, they were blended with polycaprolactone (PCL) and processed in the form of filament to be used for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. Three different epoxy materials were considered: a lab-cured epoxy resin, a lab-cured epoxy/PCL blend, and a commercial epoxy composite containing fiberglass (FR4). These three thermosets were milled and mixed with pure PCL. The distribution of the epoxy in the PCL matrix was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) coupled to a microscope. The filler FR4 and DGEBA were adequately distributed in the matrix. The rheological study anticipated good adhesion between the layers, without clogging at printing temperatures. The rheological model also predicted filament buckling. Because of that, external assistance (PLA) was required to obtain appropriate printed samples, avoiding buckling. The mechanical properties of the specimens were determined by tensile tests and compared with injection molded specimens. It was observed that the incorporation of the epoxy thermoset to the PCL matrix enhanced Young's modulus of PCL. Very similar results were obtained between 3D printed and injected samples. The proposed method could be of significant interest in employing thermoset epoxy waste as a cost-effective reinforcement for fuse filament 3D printing materials.

AB The democratization of manufacturing, led by personal fabrication tools such as three-dimensional (3D) printers, demands evaluations of the sustainability of such practices. To demonstrate the circular economy potential of personal fabrication through 3D printing (3DP), this study seeks a better understanding of the barriers to distributed recycling of 3DP waste in a maker movement context. Interviews with those involved in the maker movement and related potential stakeholders reveal barriers that hinder local recycling of 3DP waste. An interpretive structural modeling (ISM) method clarifies the structures of the relationships among the barriers, to identify the most cumbersome ones that hinder the local recycling of 3DP waste. The findings provide academics and practitioners with deeper insights into the barriers to distributed recycling of 3DP waste, as well as ideas for accelerating innovative 3DP solutions for sustainability.

AB Aluminum-plastic packaging is a multilayer material composed of polymer and aluminum, which has been applied in food, medical, and other fields, due to the excellent fresh-keeping and barrier performance. However, it is difficult to recycle aluminum-plastic packaging waste (APPW) due to the complicated components and the low value of reclaim products. This paper reports a green way to recycle the APPW by solid-state shear milling ((SM)-M-3) technology and then fabricate APPW/expandable graphite (EG) composite parts with high thermal conductivity by fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. After the (SM)-M-3 treatment, the ultrafine APPW powder with the size of 7 similar to 8 um was obtained, and it showed excellent processibility and the APPW/EG composite parts were successfully processed by FDM technology. The APPW/EG three-dimensional (3D) printed parts showed excellent mechanical and heat transfer performance along the stretch direction (0 degrees), where the tensile strength and thermal conductivity reached 13.58 MPa and 2.71 W/mK for APPW/EG (80/20) composites, respectively, much higher than those of pure APPW composite (7.71 MPa and 0.62 W/mK). Theoretical calculations showed that the interfacial thermal resistances of APPW/EG 3D printed parts with aligned fillers were lower than other samples. Furthermore, the APPW/EG composites with 20 wt.% EG loading showed a low electrical conductivity of 10(-10) S/cm because the oxidation layer was formed on the surface of Al flakes during the (SM)-M-3 process, which can be used in the thermally conductive insulating field. The new strategy presented in this work provides a new sight to recycle APPW for value-add material.

AB The objective of this work is to investigate the potential of close-looped recycling of polylactic acid (PLA) that used in 3D printing, from the perspectives of material properties and environmental performance. A commercial grade of PLA was extruded into filament, then was subjected to fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing process. The printed products were later shredded and re-extruded for repeating 3D printing cycle. Samples were taken from each repeating cycle, were characterised in terms of mechanical, rheological, molecular, thermal and morphological properties. In the experiment, the material can only be reprocessed for two 3D printing cycles, as the reprocessed material can no longer be further processing. Although little changes are observed in the mechanical properties, the viscosity measurements suggest that PLA deteriorates significantly due to the repeated FDM 3D printing cycles. The reduced viscosity values are compatible with the decrements in average molecular weights and thermal stability, the increments of carbonyl bonds, crystallinity and pinholes in the materials' surfaces. Virgin PLA was blended into the recycled material to improve the viscosities, which enables the blends 3D printable. The results of life cycle assessment approach show that the environmental burdens associated with close looped recycling are lower than those of placing the 3D printed products in incineration or in landfill. Incineration might be another environmental alternative, due to the material embodies a relatively high calorific value; however, the material is not recuperated, thus incineration cannot satisfy the more stringent environmental legislations, in which recovery and reuse of materials are rigorously required.

AB The article presents new application of the material obtained from the recycling of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) - the material acquired from operating parts of industry Dimension Elite 3D printer by Stratasys. The operating parts were used to prepare the regranulate and to produce filament, the latter of which was applied used in the FFF technology (Fused Filament Fabrication). Manufactured in the FFF technology, test specimens were used to determine the selected mechanical properties and to compare the obtained results with the properties characteristic of molded pieces made of ABS regranulate that were produced by injection molding. The paper presents results of tests performed on a filament, obtained from the ABS regranulate and indicates characteristic processing properties of that material. It also discusses beneficial processing parameters for injection molding (IM) and 3D printing (FFF). The study also presents selected results of tests of functional properties of ABS products in the FFF technology. The research results have allowed to assess the possibility of recycling of the operating parts of 3D printers in FFF.

AB As global plastic production reaches unprecedented levels, the increasing amount of plastic entering our oceans poses serious environmental risks. The Circular Economy (CE) concept plays a key role in this shift, from linear to circular, by promoting waste reduction, improved recycling methods, and innovative technologies that convert waste into value-added products. Among waste polymers, poly (ethylene terephthalate) PET, known for its enhanced properties like chemical resistance and mechanical properties, which is widely used for water bottles and food containers, is a prime candidate for recycling efforts. Taking advantage of 3D printing and recycled PET as a feedstock emerged as one of the potential solutions to reuse waste PET. However, 3D printing recycled PET (r-PET) is challenging due to the deterioration of physical properties after recycling compared to virgin PET, like reduced viscosity and melt strength, as well as chain scission. To address these challenges and direct 3D printing of r-PET, this study, for the first time, modified r-PET using a proprietary additive, to make it compatible with 3D printing and enhance properties. Through analysis of flow behavior and examinations of thermal stability, chemical structures, and mechanical properties, it is found that 0.75% is the optimum amount of additive added to r-PET, which improves the printability of r-PET feedstock. After the addition of 0.75% additive, the complex viscosity of the modified r-PET increased from 200 Pa.s to around 1000 Pa.s, which meets the viscosity requirements for 3D printing. In addition, ultimate tensile strength of modified r-PET reached around 51 MPa which is comparable with commercial filaments like ABS, PETG and PLA. The findings of this study highlight the importance of using modifiers as additives to enhance the properties of recycled waste plastic, rendering them suitable for 3D printing. This facilitates the reprocessing and remanufacturing of new products within the framework of a circular economy with the aid of 3D printing.

AB Concrete 3D printing is a promising manufacturing technology for producing geometrically complex structures efficiently and cost-effectively, by eliminating the need for formwork, reducing labor, and minimizing waste. This method has the potential to lower carbon emissions and resource use. However, it does not mitigate the carbon emissions associated with cement production. Nonetheless, utilizing waste materials in concrete 3D printing may reduce concrete carbon emissions and support recycling. This study investigates the use of two industrial waste materials-fly ash (FA) and ground waste glass (GWG)-as partial substitutes for ordinary Portland Cement (PC) in 3D printable cement paste. The chemical composition, particle size distribution, rheological properties, and flexural strength of the mixtures were analyzed. Results show that specimens containing waste materials achieved strengths comparable to traditional cement mixtures. The flexural strength reduction in 3D printed versus cast specimens varied across mixtures: control (66% reduction), FA20 (35%), FA10-GWG10 (35%), GWG10 (32%), FA10 (11%), and GWG20 (4%). Hence, incorporating waste materials in concrete 3D printing is recommended, as it maintains mechanical integrity while promoting recycling and upcycling of industrial waste.

AB In 2014, the digital file for a needed 4.48-inch ratcheting wrench was sent from designers on Earth to the 3D printer on the International Space Station (ISS). The wrench was fabricated on ISS in less than four hours without need to wait for an Earth resupply mission; it was the first useful tool 3D printed in space. Emerging space-borne manufacturing facilitated by 3D printing strongly parallels terrestrial residential recycling programs. These similarities are being leveraged to create a recycling-focused learning module for middle school students at Ignite School House, an educational non-profit organization. By studying why recycling is valuable and how it is accomplished in the closed and highly-controlled environment of a manned space vehicle, middle school learners internalize why terrestrial residential recycling programs are important for energy and resource preservation on Earth. In the middle school module, plastic waste will be recycled into 3D printer filament, which will then be used to 3D print custom objects valuable for education. To advance this program, Ignite School House and social enterprise Engineer Inc. created Customer Needs specifications for a custom-built multi-material filament extruder to perform the plastic recycling process. Indoor classroom air quality near operating filament extruders and 3D printers emerged as a critical unresolved human health concern. However, safe indoor air quality parameters for terrestrial filament extruders and 3D printers have not yet been established. To quantify air pollution levels for the Ignite School House classroom, concentrations of particulate matter, formaldehyde, and total volatile organic compounds were experimentally measured for an unenclosed 3D printer. ABS filament was found to the most polluting, followed by PETG then PLA. Further testing using an open source IKEA Lack table enclosure and a fan-vented enclosure demonstrated that these enclosure barriers are generally effective in reducing indoor air pollution during 3D printing. These results recommend that all classroom-based 3D printers and filament extruders be enclosed, at least until safe air quality levels for human health are established for these technologies.

AB Light-based 3D printing has received significant attention due to several advantages including high printing speed and resolution. Along with the development of new technologies, material design is key for the next generation of light-based 3D printing. Conventional printable polymeric materials, also known as photopolymers or photoresins, often lead to thermosets-polymer networks cross-linked by permanent covalent bonds which bring limited adaptability and restricted reprocessability. Dynamic bonds that can reversibly break and reform enable network rearrangement, thereby offering unprecedented properties to the materials such as adaptability, self-healing, and recycling capabilities. Hence, introducing dynamic bonds into materials for light-based 3D printing is a promising strategy to further expand and meet the diverse application scenarios of 3D printed multi-functional materials and moreover meet more demanding sustainable and nature-inspired design considerations (e.g., adaptability and self-healing). Herein, an overview of recent advances in dynamic photopolymers for light-based 3D printing, aiming to bridge these two promising research fields is presented. Importantly, the current challenges are also analyzed and perspectives for further developing dynamic photopolymers for light-based 3D printing and their potential applications are provided.

AB Additive manufacturing is an attractive technology due to its versatility in producing parts with diverse properties from a single material. However, the process often generates plastic waste, particularly from failed prints, making sustainability a growing concern. Recycling this waste material presents a potential solution for reducing environmental impact while creating new, functional parts. In this study, the feasibility of creating printable filaments from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) waste and virgin PLA pellets was explored. Filaments were manufactured in the lab using a single-screw desktop extruder with four temperature zones, with compositions ranging from 100% virgin PLA to 100% recycled PLA in 10% composition increments. Test samples were 3D printed using a Material Extrusion 3D printer and subjected to tensile testing in conjunction with digital image correlation to evaluate their ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, Young's modulus, ductility, toughness, and strain distribution. The results indicated that the optimal mechanical properties were observed in specimens made from 100% virgin PLA, 100% recycled PLA, and a 50% virgin/50% recycled PLA blend. Additionally, comparisons with a commercially produced PLA filament revealed that 100% virgin and 100% recycled blends have a 50.33% and 48% higher tensile strength than commercial filament, respectively. However, commercial filaments exhibited higher ductility and toughness than the lab-made extruded filament.

AB In a world grappling with environmental challenges and the need for sustainable manufacturing practices, the convergence of 3D printing and recycling emerges as a promising solution. This research paper explores the potential of combining these two technologies and comprehensively analyses their synergistic effects. The study delves into the printability of recycled materials, evaluating their suitability for 3D printing and comparing their performance with conventional materials. The environmental impact of 3D printing with recycled materials is examined through a sustainability analysis and a life cycle assessment of recycled 3D printed objects. The findings reveal significant benefits, including enhanced resource efficiency, waste reduction, and customisation possibilities. The research also identifies challenges and opportunities for scaling up the use of recycled materials in 3D printing, highlighting the importance of collaboration, innovation, and regulations. With potential applications spanning various industries, from prototyping to construction and healthcare, the implications of this research are far-reaching. By embracing sustainable practices, industry collaboration, and innovation, the integration of 3D printing and recycling can pave the way for a more sustainable future, where resource conservation, circularity, and customised production are at the forefront of manufacturing.

AB The objective of this work is to evaluate the reprocessing of PLA 3D printing waste from different origins, into filaments and films, and without the addition of any additive. Two types of waste were considered: a blend of different printing wastes (masks, visors, other components) of personal protective equipment coming from an association of Spanish coronamakers, and PLA waste from a single known commercial source. Both types of materials were subjected to repeated extrusion cycles and processed into films by compression molding. Samples were characterized after each cycle and their mechanical and viscosity properties evaluated. Diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments were also carried out to estimate molecular weights. The results show a better performance for the PLA waste from the known origin, capable of withstanding up to three re-extrusion cycles per two for the waste blending, without significant degradation. Additionally, a model to address collection and mechanical recycling cycles under two different scenarios (full traceability and not full traceability) was proposed.

AB In this study, 3D printing filaments were produced from hemp hurd fibre-reinforced polylactide (PLA) composites. Hemp hurd microfibres were obtained through alkaline digestion followed by a bleaching treatment and were used to produce PLA-based composites with 20-40 wt% fibre content for fused deposition modelling. Tensile testing of 3D printed composites revealed a gradual increase of Young's modulus with the addition of fibres, reaching a maximum of 7.1 GPa for the 40 wt% composite - a two-fold increase to neat PLA. However, tensile strength was only improved for the 20 wt% formulation, with an increase of 8% in comparison with neat PLA. Nevertheless, the thermo-mechanical properties of the composites were significantly enhanced with the addition of fibres. In addition, physical objects were printed from the recycled filaments to assess their recyclability and printability. It was found that the recycled filaments maintained comparable mechanical properties and printability after three recycling cycles.

AB In recent years, plastics recycling has become one of the leading environmental and waste management issues. Along with the main advantage of plastics, which is undoubtedly their long life, the problem of managing their waste has arisen. Recycling is recognised as the preferred option for waste management, with the aim of reusing them to create new products using 3D printing. Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging and evolving rapid tooling technology. With 3D printing, it is possible to achieve lightweight structures with high dimensional accuracy and reduce manufacturing costs for non-standard geometries. Currently, 3D printing research is moving towards the production of materials not only of pure polymers but also their composites. Bioplastics, especially those that are biodegradable and compostable, have emerged as an alternative for human development. This article provides a brief overview of the possibilities of using thermoplastic waste materials through the application of 3D printing, creating innovative materials from recycled and naturally derived materials, i.e., biomass (natural reinforcing fibres) in 3D printing. The materials produced from them are ecological, widely available and cost-effective. Research activities related to the production of bio-based materials have gradually increased over the last two decades, with the aim of reducing environmental problems. This article summarises the efforts made by researchers to discover new innovative materials for 3D printing.

AB In order to realize high-quality and environment-friendly recycling of carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) waste and high-value reuse of recycled carbon fiber (rCF), this paper proposes an additive remanufacturing process of recycled carbon fiber reinforced composite (rCFRP). The material attribute of rCF recycled by the thermally activated oxide semiconductor was analyzed and the effect of fused deposition modeling-3D (FDM-3D) printing parameters on mechanical properties of rCFRP was investigated, and FDM-3D printed rCFRP products for automotive were prepared. The results illustrate that rCF possesses the same excellent material attribute as the virgin carbon fiber, and optimizing FDM-3D printing parameters can effectively improve the mechanical properties of rCFRP. FDM-3D printed rCFRP products are of promising application in the field of automotive lightweighting due to its characteristics of personalized customization and low cost, which verifies the feasibility of the additive remanufacturing process mentioned above.

AB Additive manufacturing technologies are gaining more and more attention, resulting in the development or modification of 3D printing techniques and dedicated materials. On the other hand, economic and ecological aspects force the industry to develop material recycling strategies. In this work, the multiple reprocessing of a commercially available PLA conductive composite with carbon black filler, dedicated to 3D printing, was investigated. The effects of extrusion temperature (190 degrees C and 200 degrees C) and reprocessing steps (1-5 steps) on the rheology, morphology, thermal and electrochemical properties of the conductive PLA 3D-printing filament were evaluated. The results showed deterioration of the thermal stability and material strength, as well as the influence of reprocessing on the melting point, which increases after initial melting. The electronic conduction mechanism of the composite depends on the percolation paths and it is also affected by the multiple processing. The reversibility of the [Fe(CN)(6)](3-/4-) redox process diminishes with a higher degradation level of the conductive PLA. Importantly, the material fluidity was too high after the multiple reprocessing, which should be considered and suitably corrected during CB-PLA application as a 3D-printed electrode material.

AB In the context of the preservation of natural resources, researchers show a growing interest in developing eco-friendly materials based on recycled polymers and natural fiber biocomposites to minimize plastic and agroindustrial waste pollution. The development of new materials must be integrated within the circular economy concepts to guarantee sustainable production. In parallel, fused deposition modeling, an additive manufacturing technology, provides the opportunity to use these new materials in an efficient and sustainable manner. This review presents the context of plastics and agro-industrial fiber pollution, followed by the opportunity to give them added value by applying circular economy concepts and implementing these residues to develop new materials for the manufacture of fused deposition modeling 3D printing technique feedstock. Colombian perspective is highlighted since 3D printing technology is growing there, and Colombian biodiversity represents a high reservoir of materials. Also, recycling in Colombia promotes compliance with the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.

AB Metal powders for additive manufacturing are expensive, and producing new ones from mined metals has a negative ecological impact. In this work, recycled and reused metal powders from MS1 steel for direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) 3D printing were evaluated in the laboratory. The powders were recycled by melting followed by gas atomizing. Virgin, recycled, and reused metal powders were evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), metallography analysis, microhardness measurements, particle size distribution (PSD), shape factor by digital image processing (DIP), and flowability testing. The results showed that the particle distribution was modified after recycling. Kurtosis analysis revealed a reduction from -0.64 for virgin powders to -1.29 for recycled powders. The results demonstrated a positive skewness, indicating that the recycled powder contained a greater proportion of smaller particles. The shape factor was also modified and changed from 1.57 for virgin powders to 1.28 for recycled powders. The microstructure also changed, and austenite was found in the recycled powders. The microhardness of recycled powder decreased by 39% compared to the virgin powder. Recycled powders did not flow, using two different funnels to evaluate their flowability. The flowability of used powder was reduced from 4.3 s to 2.9 s.

AB Polylactic acid, a biodegradable thermoplastic derived from renewable sources, has notable environmental advantages and versatile properties. However, recycled PLA often experiences reduced mechanical strength and altered chemical composition due to the recycling process, limiting its suitability for 3D printing filament applications. Recognizing the inherent limitations of recycled PLA (rPLA), this research employs a unique method of coating rPLA with dopamine (DA) and reinforcing it with kenaf fibers (KF) at various weight fractions, introducing a novel multiscale modeling approach to address the challenges of interfacial bonding and tensile performance in recycled polymers. The methodology integrates experimental single filament tensile testing with multiscale finite element modeling to accurately predict the composite's mechanical behavior across different scales. The findings reveal that a 5% kenaf fiber weight/volume fraction provides the optimal balance between tensile strength, stiffness, and toughness, achieving a significant 49.3% improvement over the unreinforced rPLA. However, increasing the kenaf fiber content beyond 5% leads to a decline in mechanical properties, attributed to higher fiber agglomeration and suboptimal fiber-matrix interactions. The novelty of this research lies in its combined use of PDA coating, natural kenaf fiber reinforcement, and advanced multiscale modeling to enhance and predict the performance of rPLA-PDA/kenaf composites, paving the way for sustainable, high-performance materials in 3D printing applications.

AB The automotive sector plays a fundamental role in the search for solutions for the reuse, remanufacturing and recycling of materials, parts and components of vehicles produced to mitigate their environmental impacts. The automotive sector has requested to mitigate its environmental impacts through the reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling of materials, parts, and components of the vehicles produced. This work presents a proposal to reuse discarded automotive parts made of talc-reinforced polypropylene (20 and 40% w/w) to produce filaments used for 3D printing. To produce the filament, firstly discarded parts were cleaned, washed, and dried. Afterward, they were ground and extruded through a machine, then used to print test samples using a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. Filaments were characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), thermogravimetry (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Melt flow index techniques. Results showed that adding talc did not significantly influence the filament's diameter, density, extrusion temperature, and roughness. Also, talc enhanced the compatibility, increasing the interaction between the composite components. This led to a reduction in the melt flow index, as the chain mobility was decreased. The developed composite filaments (20 and 40% w/w) were successfully 3D printed and the amount of talc reinforced in PP influenced the Shore D hardness values. Thus, the possibility of including plastic parts produced by FDM technology is an innovative option for car manufacturers, representing an opportunity to empower small-scale producers of polymers.Highlights 3D printing provides agile prototyping and expands design possibilities.

AB Combining recycling and additive manufacturing (AM) can bring significant environmental and economic advantages. Using recycled materials can help reduce waste and the need for virgin materials, which can be resource-intensive to extract and process. Recycling is also more energy-efficient than extracting and processing virgin materials. This paper reviews and discusses the current trends and limitations of using recycled materials for AM, an essential step toward a more sustainable manufacturing process. Specifically, this paper reviews the research on waste materials transformed into resins for stereolithography (SLA), digital light projection (DLP) printers, filaments for fused deposition modeling (FDM), as well as metal powders for selective laser melting (SLM) and selective laser sintering (SLS) printing processes. The goal is to provide an overview of the recycled materials used in AM, their recycling methods, and the mechanical and thermal properties of the resulting materials and manufactured parts. The paper also discusses potential improvements in the process and areas for future research.

AB This study aimed to examine an innovative approach for recycling and repurposing used disposable face masks to create a new 3D printing filament and to compare the mechanical properties of the developed 3D printing filament (DF) with recycled filament (RF) and commercial filament (CF). The development of the new 3D printing filaments involved examining three key pieces of information: (1) optimal melting point ranges, (2) weight, and (3) visual colors for each layer of the face mask. Using an experimental research design, the researchers melted-down disposable face masks to create the filament and analyzed its properties in comparison with RF and CF. No significant differences were identified in terms of strength among CF, RF, and DF types. The findings highlight the potential effectiveness of using disposable face masks as an alternative 3D printing material, contributing to the design and production in the 3D printing industry.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA), a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic commonly utilized in 3D printing filaments, undergoes changes in properties upon recycling. This study investigates the impact of extrusion temperature and screw speed on the properties and dimensional attributes of recycled polylactic acid (PLA) filament, a widely used biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic in 3D printing. Recycled PLA pellets (3D850D) were extruded using a single filament extruder machine at temperatures ranging from 145 to 165 degrees C and screw speeds varying from 2 to 6 rpm. The extruded filaments were 3D printed into specimens with specific parameters, and mechanical testing was conducted according to ASTM D695 standards. The results revealed a significant influence of extrusion parameters on the filament's compressive strength, yield strength, and diameter. Optimal extrusion conditions of 155 degrees C and 5 rpm yielded the highest compressive strengths, while 5 rpm and 155 degrees C parameters produced filament diameters closest to commercial standards. These findings highlight the potential for optimizing the properties of recycled PLA filament by carefully controlling the extrusion parameters. The study supports using recycled PLA filament in the 3D printing industry as an environmentally friendly and performance-efficient material, contributing to sustainable additive manufacturing practices.

AB The recycling of waste plastics primarily involves physical modification and the addition of modifiers, often utilizing equipment such as twin-screw extruders for miscible modification. Considering the widespread use of single-screw 3D printing, improving the mixing efficiency of the single-screw is crucial to achieve a "one-stop" recycling modification that is suitable for 3D printing. This paper introduces a 3D printer equipped with a mixing screw (MS) and compares it with a conventional screw (CS). We conduct numerical simulations to investigate the pressure build-up capacity, velocity streamline distribution, and the mixing effect of the MS. The mechanical properties, thermal characteristics, and molecular orientation of the recycled Polypropylene (rPP) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) mixture are investigated through experiments. The results show that the MS provides more effective elongational flows compared to the CS by breaking down the reinforcing materials into smaller particles. Additionally, toughening and modification experiments are performed on rPP and HDPE. The composites treated with the MS showed improved elongation at break (increased by similar to 111%), a stable melt crystallization temperature, and an enhanced mixing effect. This study on single-screw 3D printers lays the groundwork for streamlining the plastic recycling process and increasing the reuse rate of recycled plastics.

AB A 3D printing approach for fully recyclable continuous fiber self-reinforced composites (CFSRCs) utilizing supercooled polymer melts was proposed. Continuous autologous fibers were added to the supercooled melt zone below the polymer matrix melting temperature avoiding fiber melting which successfully enlarged the processing temperature window. Through controlled supercooled melt conditions and heat transfer simulation, the supercooled melting temperature gradient control strategy for 3D printing CFSRCs were established. The processing temperature window enlarged from 2 & DEG;C to 30 & DEG;C. Then the intrinsic connection among the printing temperature, crystallization behavior and mechanical properties of 3D printed CFSRCs were analysed. Furthermore, the interlaminar shear strength and transverse tensile property of CFSRCs were excellent than carbon fiber reinforced composites. Lastly, confirmation of the full recyclability of self-reinforced composites by mechanical recycling without mechanical property loss compared with virgin matrix. Fully recyclable CFSRCs based on 3D printing potentially establish a closed-loop recycling strategy for space applications.

AB The increase in amount of polyester textile waste is contributing to the severity of environmental pollution because polyester cannot be easily recycled. To reduce the limits of its recyclability, a value-added recycling approach should be explored. This work introduces an approach for recycling polyester textiles into 3D printable filaments. To increase recyclability of polyester textiles, the polyester materials are modified by ADR4468 additive. After the polyester is 3D printed, the sample with 1.0 wt% of ADR4468 shows the highest tensile and compressive strength properties compared with 1.5 and 2.0 wt%, owing to its fewer voids between the printed lines, a fish scale-like morphology that spreads out, and a higher degree of crystallization. Moreover, the mechanism of modification suggests that ADR4468 extends and crosslinks the polyester chains by ring-opening reactions of epoxy groups of ADR4468 and forms sea-island structures. The sea-island structures of bonded polyester branched cores with tangled polyester shell interface areas and unbonded polyester chain areas performed suitable rheological behaviors to recycle polyester textiles for 3D printable filaments production. The filaments can be used to replace commercially available filaments, offer a sustainable option for consumers, and impact both the polyester textile-related recycling and 3D printing industries.Highlights An approach is proposed to recycle polyester textiles for 3D printing filament The approach uses a mechanical method to recycle polyester textiles Recycled polyesters were modified by ADR4468 to form core-shell structures Core-shell structures were separated by short polyesters(sea-island structure) The structures met rheological behaviors for 3D printing filament

AB In light of mounting environmental concerns surrounding the overuse and accumulation of plastic waste, the United Nations (UN) has turned its attention towards sustainable materials and the Circular Economy (CE). Polymer recycling technologies have the potential to reduce the environmental impact and carbon footprint of plastic waste production, thereby contributing to the achievement of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In response to this challenge, students enrolled in the fourth year of secondary education, specializing in technology, during the 2021-2022 academic year, developed an open-source prototype that automatically transforms polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles into recycled rPET filament for 3D printing using an automated pultrusion model. In this working group, one of the students identified as gifted developed the pultrusion prototype using challenge-based learning and the project method (PM), which is now known as project-based learning. The resulting prototype has the capacity to transform PET bottles into rPET filament with mechanical properties comparable to those of commercial filaments, thereby enabling the manufacture of a wide range of products through 3D printing. It is not the intention of this work to create a commercial product. Rather, it is designed to promote social and sustainable entrepreneurship, CE, and the values of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) through the recycling of polymers by means of 3D printing production. In addition, it seeks to develop the key competences for sustainability described in the methodological framework established by UNESCO in 2017.

AB In the polymeric 3D printing process, composite material development is based on preparing feedstock material such as polymeric filaments. The present work focuses on recycling crab shell particles as bio fillers for devel-oping Polylactic Acid feedstock material. The extruded filament's intrinsic properties, such as tensile strength, diameter deviation, and surface roughness, were measured to its crab shell composition of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 wt %. The results depict that the maximum tensile strength of 61.3 MPa was achieved on the 8% crab shell-reinforced PLA polymeric filaments. A minimum diameter deviation of 0.001 was observed on the 2% crab shell -reinforced PLA filaments. The surface morphology of the extruded PLA/crab shell filaments of 8% possesses uniform distribution of added particles in the polymeric matrix. From the overall results, the PLA/crab shell filament of 8% composition is an optimal composition feedstock material for the 3D printing application to develop biomaterials like bio-scaffolds.

AB Additive manufacturing, otherwise known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, is a rapidly growing technique that is increasingly used for the production of polymer products, resulting in an associated increase in plastic waste generation. Waste from a particular class of 3D-printing, known as vat photopolymerization, is of particular concern, as these materials are typically thermosets that cannot be recycled or reused. Here, we report a mechanical recycling process that uses cryomilling to generate a thermoset powder from photocured parts that can be recycled back into the neat liquid monomer resin. Mechanical recycling with three different materials is demonstrated: two commercial resins with characteristic brittle and elastic mechanical properties and a third model material formulated in-house. Studies using photocured films showed that up to 30 wt% of the model material could be recycled producing a toughness of 2.01 +/- 0.55 MJ/m3, within error of neat analogues (1.65 +/- 0.27 MJ/m3). Using dynamic mechanical analysis and atomic force microscopy-based infrared spectroscopy, it was determined that monomers diffuse into the recycled powder particles, creating interpenetrating networks upon ultraviolet (UV) exposure. This process mechanically adheres the particles to the matrix, preventing them from acting as failure sites under a tensile load. Finally, 3D-printing of the commercial brittle material with 10 wt% recycle content produced high quality parts that were visually similar. The maximum stress (46.7 +/- 6.2 MPa) and strain at break (11.6 +/- 2.3%) of 3D-printed parts with recycle content were within error the same as neat analogues (52.0 +/- 1.7 MPa; 13.4 +/- 1.8%). Overall, this work demonstrates mechanical recycling of photopolymerized thermosets and shows promise for the reuse of photopolymerized 3D-printing waste.

AB This research addresses the grave issue of plastic waste in the Pacific. By using Samoa as a case study, it was considered that distributed recycling combined with 3D printing offers an opportunity to (1) repurpose and add new value to this difficult waste stream and (2) engage diverse local communities in Samoa by combining notions of participatory design with traditional Samoan social concepts. Fieldwork in Samoa established the scope of the issue through interviews with stakeholders in government, waste management businesses, the arts and crafts community and education. Based on the information obtained from the fieldwork, potential product areas and designs were explored through material and 3D printing experiments using low-cost, open- source equipment. The experiments informed the design of speculative scenarios for workable, economically viable, socially empowering and sustainable systems for repurposing and upcycling plastic waste, which then enabled production of practically useful and culturally meaningful 3D printed objects, artefacts and products. Building upon the outcome and with a view towards implementation, Creative Pathways, an educational initiative aimed at propagating 3D printing and contextual design, was established and is being delivered in local schools.

AB A large number of waste gypsum was reused of low-value or landfilled which caused serious waste of resources. In this study, a high value-added recycling scheme for waste building gypsum to synthesize a 3D printable material with high-precision was designed. The alpha-hemihydrate gypsum (alpha-HH) was synthesized from waste plasterboard by the salt solution hydrothermal method. A synergistic optimization strategy was proposed involving the effect of sodium succinate and pH on the morphology and mechanical strength of alpha-HH. The properties of recycled alpha-HH were modified to meet the requirements of 3D printing, including fluidity, setting time and green strength. When the modifier dosage is 0.05 wt% and the pH is 5, the best morphology of alpha-HH crystals with an average aspect ratio of 1.07 (length of 10 mu m) are synthesized. The converted product has close interlocking and intergrowth after hydration, which exhibits excellent mechanical strength (25.5 MPa). The 3D printing materials prepared by the composite modification of recycled alpha gypsum powder has proven to achieve good printable. The print errors smaller than 4% for pore objects larger than 4.0 mm, and satisfactory results are shown in terms of the strength and resolution of printing high detail cavity structures. This work provides a high value-added upcycling scheme for waste building gypsum that has great potentiality for future industrial application.

ID REUSE
AB The benefits of space recycling lie in reducing launch mass and achieving self-sufficiency. For 3D printed continuous fibre-reinforced composites (CFRCs), a reverse melt recycling technology was proposed, involving heating resin opposite to the 3D printing path and continuously peeling-off the fibres from the melt. An infrared radiation heating recycling device suitable for a vacuum environment was designed and the temperature distributions were optimised, achieving recycling of continuous carbon fibre-reinforced polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) thin-walled rotational structures. The recycled filaments with diameters of 0.7 and 0.8 mm could achieve good surface quality and low pore defects. The porosity decreased from 11.2% of original samples to 5.7% of remanufactured samples, leading to improvements in mechanical properties with flexural strength and modulus increased by 4.8% and 50.8% respectively. Overall, the recycling technology emphasised a non-degradation recycling solution for 3D-printed CFRCs in space to form a full lifecycle application model for space composites.

AB This study investigated the closed-loop recycling of 3D-printed wood fiber (WF)-filled polylactic acid (PLA) composites via fused filament fabrication (FFF). The WF-PLA composites (WPCs) were extruded into WPC filaments (WPCfs) to produce FFF-printed WPC parts (WPCps). The printed WPCps were reprocessed three times via extrusion and 3D-printing processes. The tensile properties and impact strengths of the WPCfs and WPCps were determined. To further investigate the impact of closed-loop recycling on the surface morphology, crystallinity, and molecular weight of WPCfs, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), respectively, were used. After closed-loop recycling, the surface morphology of the WPCfs became smoother, and a decrease in the pore sizes was observed; however, the tensile properties (tensile strength and elongation at break) deteriorated. With increasing numbers of recycling iterations, the molecular weight of the PLA matrix decreased, while an increase in crystallinity was observed due to the recrystallization of the low-molecular-weight PLA molecules after recycling. According to the SEM images of the recycled WPCps, their layer heights were inconsistent, and the layers were rough and discontinuous. Additionally, the color difference (Delta E*) of the recycled WPCps significantly increased. Compared with those of the WPCps after recycling them only once, the tensile strength, elongation at break, and impact strength of the WPCps noticeably decreased after recycling them twice. Considering the changes in various properties of the WPCfs and WPCps, the FFF-printed WPC parts can be reprocessed only once through 3D printing.

AB Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is one of the most widely used thermoplastic materials for 3D printing, particularly in the Fused Filament Fabrication technique. However, the printing process generates waste products and even though PLA is compostable, the possibility of recycling it provides ecological and economical benefits. In this work, a study on the stabilization of recycled PLA using charcoal (CC) was carried out, with the aim of overcoming the well-known problem of degradation (reduction in molecular weight) of PLA, during remelting. Microscopic investigations showed good dispersion of the filler in the polymer matrix, as well as better adhesion between the printed layers. Thermal analyses (Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetry) indicate a stabilization of PLA waste because of the addition of small concentrations of CC to the recycled polymer matrix. These data are confirmed by GPC analyses, which show that the addition of filler is associated with higher molecular weight. Mechanical analysis indicated improved elongation at break and elasticity. Finally, a key ring was printed as an example of the better printability of the filament containing CC. The results indicate that a stabilization of the recycled PLA with a very low concentration of CC has been achieved. Improved 3D printability and properties of the 3D printed objects can be attained through recycling and recovery of wasted PLA, according to sustainability and circular economy matters.

AB The search for sustainable polymer systems is key to tackling the current climate crisis. However, the use of biobased polymers does not suffice to achieve this goal. Additionally, chemical approaches enabling the recycling or upcycling of polymer materials need to be explored. Herein, we exploit lactate esters with different substituents as readily available biobased molecules for the synthesis of printable monomers. The synthesis of these lactate ester-based monomers follows green chemistry principles by establishing a solvent-free, one-pot approach, relying on a reusable catalyst, and achieving high conversions (84-100%) under mild conditions. Further, these monomers are utilized in 3D printable ink formulations for digital light processing (DLP) for the first time in combination with a recycled crosslinker. The resulting 3D printed structures display complex geometries with high resolution. A key attribute of the presented system is that the 3D printed polymer material can be upcycled via aminolysis affording a precursor of the crosslinker, which is in turn incorporated into further ink formulations, introducing a material circularity into the system. These results demonstrate a strategic combination of a biobased monomer and chemical upcycling with sustainable 3D printing techniques.

AB Fused deposition modelling (FDM) three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is one of the most common additive manufacturing (AM) technologies due to the relatively low cost of the printing units and materials. Although cost-effective, this technology is not conceived to convert 100% of the raw material into a complete product, creating a potential plastic waste problem. To recycle the plastic waste from the FDM machine into reusable filaments, the concept of a 3D printer material-recycling machine (3DP-MRM) was developed using CREO Parametric 9.0 software. A prototype with four systems, including a spooler system, extruder system, display system, and filament-positioning system, was manufactured in-house with complete run experiments. The tests of the 3DP-MRM were applied, and the machine worked successfully among all the designed functions with minor issues.

AB Non-woven disposable masks play a unique role in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic threat in transmission between people, but the huge amount of disposable non-woven masks generated every day are currently posing a serious challenge to our environment on a global-wide scale. In line with this emerging problem, a series of recycling processes were designed and conducted to evaluate the performance of material recovered from those waste masks for potential use in three-dimensional (3D) printing. A composite filament from recycled polypropylene (rPP) and an additive material, glass fiber (GF), was fabricated by melt-blending processing followed by single-screw extrusion. A variety of material properties, including the chemical/mechanical/microstructure property, thermal stability, printability, rheology performance, and geometrical accuracy toward GF/rPP composite filaments, were comprehensively analyzed. Our results demonstrated that two important mechanical properties, the compression strength and the tensile strength, to a 3D printed object by fused deposition modeling (FDM) from the GF/rPP composite were significantly higher than that of a FDM 3D printed object from GF/polypropylene composites. The specific warpage parameter (Wsp) and the surface roughness (Sa) for a 3D printed object from the GF/rPP composite at 30 wt% GF additive would have printing accuracy of 0.54% +/- 0.0014 and 21.1 +/- 0.76 mu m, respectively, and no clogging phenomenon was observed in the printer nozzle channel during the printing processing, suggested that this recycling method for a large number of non-woven waste masks was potentially applicable in serving as a FDM 3D printing material.

AB This article introduces a one-step extrusion-based fused deposition modeling (FDM) approach for the challenging separation of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) during recycling. A shear screw printer (SSP) with shear elements was designed, and it was compared to a conventional single-screw printer (CSP) to investigate the differences in print stability, degradation levels, tensile performance, molecular orientation, and crystallization when preparing recycled PP and recycled PET blends. Although the retention effect of the SSP screw slightly increases the degradation of the blended rPP/rPET, the strong shear (2.6 x 104 s-1) applied near the extrusion exit improves the blending efficiency. The SSP also enhances molecular orientation, modulus of the parts, and reduces performance fluctuations. Additionally, the SSP has the potential to simplify the recycling process, enabling the transformation of blended recycled materials into products with just one melt process.

AB Vitrimers, a type of dynamically crosslinked polymers that combine the solvent- and heat-resistance of thermosets with the reprocessability of thermoplastics, offer a new solution to the problem of plastic pollution. However, the current recycling approaches of vitrimers greatly constrain the shapes of recycled vitrimers to simple geometries, thus significantly limiting the application scopes of recycled vitrimers. Here, a simple but universal method for upcycling vitrimer wastes is reported by developing a UV curable recycling (UVR) solution system. Conventional unprintable vitrimer powders can be mixed with the UVR solution, and the resulting mixture is compatible with digital light processing based 3D printing to fabricate 3D structures with high resolution (up to 20 mu m) and high geometric complexity. Heat treatment triggers bond exchange reactions in the printed structures, and greatly enhances the mechanical properties. This method allows to cyclically print vitrimer wastes multiple times. Moreover, the UVR-vitrimer mixture solution can work as an adhesive to bond printed small parts together to build a larger and more complex structure which cannot be printed. The upcycling method reported in this work extends the application scope of recycled vitrimers and provide a practical solution to address environmental challenges associated with plastic pollution.

AB Concrete construction is one of the largest producers of CO2 emissions and waste from discarded formwork. 3D printing of formwork using polymer extrusion 3D printing can increase the sustainability of concrete construction by allowing the fabrication of optimized geometry. However, polymer extrusion printed formwork must be discarded after being used several times. Therefore, this paper explores the potential of recycling 3D printed formwork. We describe a workflow in which a formwork is 3D printed, filled with concrete, removed, recycled, and reprinted into a new formwork. Two case studies are presented: filament-printed PET-G formwork for a concrete column, and pellet-printed PIPG formwork for a series of columns. The results indicate that the printing material can be fully recycled for at least one cycle.

AB According to research findings of many peer-reviewed studies, up to 90% of household items may be made of plastic. But nowadays, just a small portion of plastic waste is recycled. Plastic pyrolysis and polymer breakdown are environmentally hazardous. Processing is, therefore, necessary for recycling. Plastics are constantly being manufactured and require minimal processing, necessitating innovation. Plastic recycling is becoming a major issue for environmentalists and waste management professionals. Fused deposition modelling, or FDM, is one of the most popular types of additive manufacturing. It uses the melt extrusion process to deposit filaments of thermal polymers in a predetermined pattern. Using a computer-generated design, 3D printing, sometimes referred to as additive manufacturing, is a technique for building three-dimensional objects layer by layer. A 3D item is produced by the additive method of 3D printing, which involves building up layers of material. To make a three-dimensional object, FDM printers eject a thermoplastic filament that has been heated to its melting point layer by layer. 3D printing is a rapidly expanding industry and the market in this field has grown up to 23% by 2021. Several experiments on new 3D printing materials have been carried out to reduce pollution and the supply of plastic. Various additives have been investigated to increase recycled polymers' molecular weight and mechanical properties. The most frequent type of fibre found in that is thermoplastic fibre. In this instance, waste ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic from industrial FDM printers was gathered and examined in a bustling open shop. In this review, we discussed the use of recyclable polymers in 3D printing for waste material management.

DE Filament; 3D printing; Recycling; Composite
AB Additive Manufacturing (3D Printing, and specifically Material Extrusion) is a rapid and convenient manufacturing method using raw material in filament form and is a potential candidate process for the use of recycled plastics and fibres gathered from industrial waste and domestic recycling. In this research, off-cuts of basalt fibre and recycled mushroom trays made of Polypropylene (PP) have been collected, recycled and com-bined in an extruder to make short fibre reinforced filaments as material extrusion feedstock filament material. A Noztek Touch Dual PID filament maker was utilized to make reinforced PP with 0%, 2%, 5%, and 8% basalt fibre weight fractions. The extruding parameters including motor speed, heating temperatures, cooling fan status, extrusion tension have been optimized to produce a filament made from these waste materials with the desired surface quality, void content, and profile. Microscopic assessment has been carried out to verify the fibre dispersion and above mentioned quality measures in the upcycled filaments. Differential scanning calorimetry has been done to measure the melting and crystallization temperatures of collected polypropylene and recycled filaments, and the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the reinforced recycled polypropylene have been measured in presence of different percentages of short basalt fibres with 4.5 mm length. The produced filaments with 5% wt. of basalt are a good candidate for use as feedstock in manufacturing using 3D printing.

AB This work aimed at investigating the effects of recycling on the mechanical properties of recycled polypropylene (PP)-based composites and improving the mechanical properties of recycled materials by adjusting the remanufacturing temperature. In this study, 3D printing was selected as the remanufacturing approach and the composites were ground and reextruded up to nine times to simulate mechanical recycling. The gel permeation chromatography results indicated that the recycling led to a reduction in molecular weight, increasing the melt fluidity of the materials. Excessive melt flow of material during printing caused the poor quality of printed parts with macro and micro defects, deteriorating the mechanical properties of the printed specimens. To improve the final quality and mechanical properties of the printed specimens, melt flow during the printing of recycled materials was adjusted by tuning the printing temperature. The results found that the mechanical properties of the recycled PP-based composites were well enhanced by using tuned printing temperature.

AB In the last years, the excessive use of plastic and other synthetic materials, that are generally difficult to dispose of, has caused growing ecological worries. These are contributing to redirecting the world's attention to sustainable materials and a circular economy (CE) approach using recycling routes. In this work, bio-filaments for the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printing technique were produced from recycled polylactic acid (PLA) and artisanal ceramic waste by an extrusion process and fully characterized from a physical, thermal, and mechanical point of view. The data showed different morphological, thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of the two produced filaments. Furthermore, the 3D objects produced from the 100% recycled PLA filament showed lower mechanical performance. However, the results have demonstrated that all the produced filaments can be used in a low-cost FFF commercial printer that has been modified with simple hand-made operations in order to produce 3D-printed models. The main objective of this work is to propose an example of easy and low-cost application of 3D printing that involves operations such as the reprocessing and the recyclability of materials, that are also not perfectly mechanically performing but can still provide environmental and economic benefits.

AB Producing lightweight structures with high weight-specific strength and stiffness, self-healing abilities, and recyclability, is highly attractive for engineering applications such as aerospace, biomedical devices, and smart robots. Most self-healing polymer systems used to date for mechanical components lack 3D printability and satisfactory load-bearing capacity. Here, we report a new self-healable polymer composite for Digital Light Processing 3D Printing, by combining two monomers with distinct mechanical characteristics. It shows a desirable and superior combination of properties among 3D printable self-healing polymers, with tensile strength and elastic modulus up to 49 MPa and 810 MPa, respectively. Benefiting from dual dynamic bonds between the linear chains, a healing efficiency of above 80% is achieved after heating at a mild temperature of 60 degrees C without additional solvents. Printed objects are also endowed with multi-materials assembly and recycling capabilities, allowing robotic components to be easily reassembled or recycled after failure. Mechanical properties and deformation behaviour of printed composites and lattices can be tuned significantly to suit various practical applications by altering formulation. Lattice structures with three different architectures were printed and tested in compression: honeycomb, re-entrant, and chiral. They can regain their structural integrity and stiffness after damage, which is of great value for robotic applications. This study extends the performance space of composites, providing a pathway to design printable architected materials with simultaneous mechanical robustness/healability, efficient recoverability, and recyclability.

AB Sustainabi l i t y of 3D printing can be reflected in three main aspects: deployment of renewable inks, recycling of printed products, and applications for energy-and materials-savings. In this work, we demonstrated sustainable vat-photopolymerization (VPP)-based 3D printing in a whole life-cycle process by developing a renewable ink made of soybean oil and natural polyphenols and recycling the ink for reprinting or conver t i n g printed biocomposite to flash graphene (FG) as reinforcing nanofillers in the biocomposite. We also realized its applications in fabricating lightweight, materials-saving 3D structures, acoustic metamaterials, and disposable micro-reactors for time-saving and efficiency-improving synthesis of metal-organic framework nanostructures. In addition to enhancing the tensile strength and Young's modulus of the biopolymers by 42% and 232% with only 0.6 wt % FG nanofillers, respectiv e l y , FG improved the printabi l i t y of the ink in forming 3D tubula r structures, which are usually very hard to be achieved in transparent resin. Success of this work wil l inspire further development for sustainability in 3D printing.

AB The purpose of this study is to limit the environmental impact of packaging applications by promoting the recycling of waste products and the use of sustainable materials in additive manufacturing technology. To this end, a commercial polylactide acid (PLA)-based filament derived from waste production of bio-bags is herein considered. For reference, a filament using virgin PLA and one using a wood-based biocomposite were characterized as well. Preliminary testing involved infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of printing parameters (namely bed temperature, layer thickness, top surface layers, retraction speed, and distance) on the final aesthetics of 3D printed parts was verified. The results allow us to attest that the thermal properties of recycled polymer are comparable to those of virgin PLA and biocomposite. In the case of recycled polymer, after the extrusion temperature, bed temperature, and printing speed are estabilished the lowest allowable layer thickness and an appropriate choice of retraction movements are required in order to realize 3D-printed objects without morphological defects visible to the naked eyes. In the case of wood biocomposite, the printing process was complicated by frequent obstructions, and in none of the operating conditions was it possible to obtain an aesthetically satisfying piece of the chosen geometry (Lego-type bricks) Finally, mechanical testing on the 3D printed parts of each system showed that the recycled PLA behaves similarly to virgin and wood/PLA filaments.

AB As additive manufacturing rapidly expands the number of materials including waste plastics and composites, there is an urgent need to reduce the experimental time needed to identify optimized printing parameters for novel materials. Computational intelligence (CI) in general and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms in particular have been shown to accelerate finding optimal printing parameters. Unfortunately, the implementation of CI has been prohibitively complex for noncomputer scientists. To overcome these limitations, this article develops, tests, and validates PSO Experimenter, an easy-to-use open-source platform based around the PSO algorithm and applies it to optimizing recycled materials. Specifically, PSO Experimenter is used to find optimal printing parameters for a relatively unexplored potential distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) material that is widely available: low-density polyethylene (LDPE). LDPE has been used to make filament, but in this study for the first time it was used in the open source fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication system. PSO Experimenter successfully identified functional printing parameters for this challenging-to-print waste plastic. The results indicate that PSO Experimenter can provide 97% reduction in research time for 3D printing parameter optimization. It is concluded that the PSO Experimenter is a user-friendly and effective free software for finding ideal parameters for the burgeoning challenge of DRAM as well as a wide range of other fields and processes.

AB 3D printing of commercial thermosetting epoxy resin is of great significance for the rapid and low-cost construction of high-strength objects with complex structures. Meanwhile, recycling these commercial epoxy resins is essential for environmental protection and sustainable development. This paper reports direct ink writing 3D printing of a multifunctional composite material based on commercial bisphenol A epoxy resin and a 3D printing compatible technique to recycle the printed composite material. Graphene nanoplatelet is designed as an efficient functional thixotropic additive that turns the liquid epoxy resin prepolymer shear-thinning and suitable for direct ink printing. Composite materials with high resolution and high mechanical strength are printed with epoxy resin/graphene nanoplatelet inks, and they also show high thermal and electrical conductivity and fast thermo-induced shape memory response. The printed objects can be recycled by comminuting them into micropowders, which are then used as a thixotropic agent to prepare recycled DIW ink The physical properties of the materials printed with recycled inks maintain unchanged for successive four recycling cycles. The graphene nanoplatelets at the surface of recycled comminuted powder are found to modulate the surface energy of the powder, thus making the powder able to serve as a thixotropic agent for the recycled inks. The method here provides a new solution to process commercial epoxy resin and opens a new direction to the more sustainable use of thermosetting plastics.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA)-hydroxyapatite (HAP)-chitosan (CS)-based thermoplastic composite matrix has proven scaffolding and implant applications. But hitherto little has been reported on the recycling of PLA-HAP-CS-based 3D printed biomedical scaffolds/implants collected as waste (for tunable mechanical, rheological, morphological, voltage (V)-current (I), and shape memory properties). This paper reports the fabrication of PLA composite-based filament for 3D printing of smart biomedical scaffolds. The composite was prepared by melt processing of recycled PLA with reinforcement of HAP and CS (for possible online health monitoring) by tuning mechanical, rheological, morphological, V-I, and shape memory properties. For 3D printing of biomedical scaffolds/implants, a single screw extruder was used in this study with input parameters; the number of shredding cycles (for ensuring recyclability), screw rpm, and processing temperature (for ensuring uniform blending). The mechanical properties such as ultimate tensile strength, Young's modulus (E), and modulus of toughness were explored for the fabrication of functional prototypes. The results have been supported by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, Fourier transformed infrared, and X-ray diffraction analysis. For enhancing the functional capabilities of scaffolds 4D capabilities for one-way programming (in terms of shape memory characterization) were ascertained. Finally, possibilities for 3D printed biomedical scaffolds with the capability of online health monitoring (based on V-I characteristics) have been established.

AB 3D printing of various polymers has attracted great attention and developed rapidly in recent years. Digital light processing (DLP) has recently emerged as a fast growing 3D printing technique due to its high resolution and high speed. However, the lack of printable high-performance materials limits its broad applications. In addition, with the increasing adoption of DLP 3D printing, the efficient recycling of printed thermosetting materials is highly desired. Herein, we proposed a two-stage curing approach involving dynamic reactions by using the acrylate-epoxy hybrid resin for the recyclable DLP 3D printing of high-performance thermosetting polymers. Bond exchange reactions (BERs) could establish covalent bonds between the acrylate network and the epoxy network, thus partially triggering the copolymerization. The resulting new polymers exhibited excellent mechanical properties. A small-molecule assisted BER method was then used to efficiently depolymerize the thermosetting printed parts into soluble oligomers, which were formulated with fresh photopolymers for the next round of printing. The reprinted samples still showed good mechanical properties comparable to the virgin ones. In addition, the new polymers demonstrated potential applications in 4D printing of smart actuators. This work opens a novel avenue for green manufacturing technologies. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB Continuous fiber-reinforced composites 3D printing can significantly improve strength but make materialize recycling more difficult. This study explores the feasibility of recycling and remanufacturing in practical applications by simulating the change in mechanical properties during outdoor aging of continuous aramid fiber-reinforced 3D printed parts. First, a Fermat's Spiral based globally continuous path was used to fabricate recyclable fiber-reinforced prints. Then, the continuous aramid fiber-reinforced PLA (CF/PLA) composites were recycled from the printed parts and re-impregnated in the subsequent production. Finally, the CF/PLA composite specimens were exposed to UV irradiation and moisture cycling in an aging test chamber, and the aging process of the whole experiment lasted for 516 h. It was found that for the first recycled and remanufactured specimens, the tensile strength was 204 MPa, which was higher than that of the originally printed specimens (196 MPa), and the flexural strength and modulus were 159 MPa and 6.4 GPa, higher than those of original specimens, which were 141 MPa and 5.6 GPa, an increase of 12.77% and 14.29%, respectively. For the specimens aged 172, 344, and 516 h, the tensile strength increased by 4.32%, 3.60%, and 17.36%, respectively after recycling and remanufacturing. The reduction rate of the tensile strength of the remanufactured specimens was 15.3% lower than that of the raw materials in the aging process. Our experiments estimated the change in properties of remanufactured specimens from recycled fiber-reinforced materials after natural aging, demonstrating the feasibility of the manufacturing process for recycled fiber-reinforced materials in practical applications.

AB Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) thermoplastic polyester is durable, formable material that is widely used to manufacture consumer products like sailcloth, sailing spinnakers, food-grade containers, etc. for commercial and engineering applications. The recycling of PET is still a challenge because of its abundance, especially in low-income/developing countries. The present study reports the recycling of PET by utilizing the primary (1 degrees) recycled PET (R-PET) for 3D printing-based sensor applications with the idea of converting waste to wealth. The investigations were performed on PET-based waste collected from institute campus canteens (in form of used food containers/soft drink bottles) after ascertaining their rheological, mechanical, morphological, bonding, and sensing capabilities. The sensing capabilities of R-PET were explored by performing a ring resonator test of a 3D-printed substrate using a vector network analyzer (VNA). The result of the study outlined that R-PET-based sensors may be used in sailcloth, and sailing spinnakers to monitor the location of boats in a shipyard/dock.

AB The revolution of 3D-printing technology has caused an additional source of plastic waste, especially the new generation of composite filaments that are linked with the commercial fused deposition modeling process, adding pressure to find a sustainable solution to tackle the emerging waste problem. This study aims to investigate the mechanical and thermal properties of a blended recycled composite material produced by mixing two different 3D-printed reinforced composite wastes, carbon fiber CF/nylon, and glass fiber GF/nylon filaments that were mixed at different percentages using a hot extrusion procedure, tested by a tensile testing machine, and processed with five different weight ratios to study the impact of blend ratios on the material characteristics of the recycled composites and to find the optimum weight ratios with the most preferred properties. The results revealed that the maximum tensile strength of the GF/nylon composite was achieved with 60 wt%. The highest elastic modulus value was recorded at 60 wt% GF/nylon. Moreover, it was noted that at 80 wt% of GF/nylon, the ductility is at the peak value among the composites.

AB As the demand for thermoplastic composite materials continues to surge across diverse industries, the imperative for efficient waste management, collection, and recycling of domestic thermoplastic materials has become increasingly evident. This study presents a novel approach to upcycling non-printable domestic High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) waste and industrial waste fibres into viable feedstock for 3D printing manufacturing, addressing critical technical challenges such as adhesion to the build plate, nozzle clogging, and warpage. The investigation focused on the incorporation of various glass fibre weight fractions-2 wt%, 5 wt%, 8 wt%, 15 wt %, 30 wt%, 45 wt%, and 60 wt%-into HDPE waste. The optimisation of filament production and 3D printing parameters was performed, resulting in the highest tensile strengths for both filament (54.5 MPa) and printed specimens (29.83 MPa) at a glass fibre content of 45 wt%. It was observed that exceeding a glass fibre content of 45 wt% led to fibre agglomeration, subsequently diminishing tensile strength in both filaments and printed samples. In contrast, the samples with 30 wt% glass fibre exhibited the highest flexural strength. The study further employed optical microscopy to evaluate fibre distribution and internal defects within the filaments and printed samples, while Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was utilised to analyse the fracture surfaces of 3D printed coupons. The findings revealed that the dominant fracture mechanism in these composites was fibre pullout. The research successfully fabricated a demonstrator, showcasing the potential of HDPE domestic thermoplastic waste, reinforced with glass fibre, to be processed into functional industrial composite components via 3D printing.

AB Poly-[Methyl Methacrylate] (PMMA)-based filaments are steadily gaining popularity among other polymers for material extrusion additive manufacturing (AM). Considering the multi-billion $ market of PMMA and the volume of scrap and/or manufacturing remnants and trimming, their mechanical recycling in the AM industry holds economic and sustainability potential. Herein, PMMA sheet trimmings were deployed as feedstock material and shredded into washed and dried pellets. The feedstock was melt extruded to produce filaments for the 3D printing of the specimens for 17 different tests. After completion of the qualitative and quantitative evaluation of their structural, thermal, rheological, mechanical, and quality scores, the specimens were shredded again into pellets, and the entire process was repeated for six (6) successive cycles. This massive experimental effort involved dozens of specimens and yielded excellent material-property scores. PMMA exhibited thermomechanical stability, marginal thermal degradation, and persistent printability indices throughout the mechanical recycling course. Substantial enhancements of 9.2% and 5.2%) in the tensile and flexural mechanical properties, respectively, were documented in the second thermomechanical cycle. These findings motivated the reuse of PMMA 3D printed parts at the end of their lifecycle.

TI 3D Printing with Recycled PET as a Sustainable Thermoplastic Alternative

AB Filament-based 3D printing offers significant advantages but faces sustainability challenges due to its reliance on seldom recycled thermoplastics. Utilizing recycled PET presents a promising sustainable alternative leveraging the global PET recycling infrastructure. This study investigates the feasibility of using rPET for 3D printing filaments by comparing mechanical properties against common commercial filaments (PLA, ABS, and PETG). The paper establishes a baseline by characterizing the tensile properties of the filaments and comparing these to standardized 3D printed specimens in both in-plane and layer adhesion orientations. Results showed a quantifiable loss in mechanical performance between the filament and the printed part across all materials, with XY-axis properties generally showing better correlation to filament properties than Z-axis properties, influenced by interlayer adhesion. PET filaments exhibited modulus values comparable to ABS but lower than PETG and PLA. While PET and rPET demonstrated printability using modern equipment, they showed significant strength reductions in printed form, particularly in the Z-axis, potentially linked to crystallization effects impacting layer bonding. PET lost approximately 30% of modulus strength in the XY-axis, similar to PETG. This work establishes filament testing as a valuable baseline for material comparison independent of printing complexities and furthers rPET's potential as a more sustainable filament option.

AB In recent times, the issue of plastic recycling has become one of the leading issues of environmental protection and waste management. Polymer materials have been found an application in many areas of daily life and industry. Along with their extended use, the problem of plastic wastes appeared because, after withdrawal from use, they became persistent and noxious wastes. The possibility of reusing polymeric materials gives a possibility of valorization-a second life-and enables effective waste utilization to obtain consumable products. The 3D printing market is a well-growing sector. Printable filaments can be made from a variety of thermoplastic materials, including those from recycling. This paper focuses on a review of the available literature on the production of filaments for 3D printers from recycled polymers as the alternative to present approach of central selective collection of plastics. The possibility of recycling of basic thermoplastic materials and the impact of processing on their physicochemical and mechanical properties were verified (Lanzotti et al.2019). In addition, commercially available filaments produced from recycled materials and devices which allow self-production of filaments to 3D printing from plastic waste were reviewed.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) or additive manufacturing is regarded as an environmentally friendly and sustainable form of manufacturing, which allows circular manufacturing as the 3D printed waste and products can be recycled for further 3DP operations. Due to the fact that the reclaimed material is commonly perceived to have poorer quality than the virgin material, the pricing of materials and printed products are crucial for consumers to decide their printing and material selection decisions. We consider a closed-loop competitive circular supply chain comprising (1) a 3DP platform that provides 3DP services to print products from virgin and recycled materials, (2) material suppliers that provide virgin and recycled materials (filaments) for the platform, and (3) end users who use the platform to print their products. We derive the prices, demands, and profits of the 3DP platform and material suppliers in Stackelberg equilibrium. We also conduct numerical studies using real-life data to generate practical insights from the analytical findings. Most interestingly, we find that while the platform prefers, both types of suppliers avoid, printing high-quality products from recycled material. We derive management insights and policy implications from the analytical and numerical findings for the closed-loop competitive circular supply chain.

AB The additive manufacturing of a bio-based, UV active, recyclable and reshapable polybenzoxazine is demonstrated. A new ditelechelic benzoxazine monomer (CHDM-PA-mea) was prepared by esterification of phloretic acid (PA) and cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM)-both chosen for sustainability-and then reacting the product with monoethanolamine (mea) and paraformaldehyde (PFA). This yielded a molecule with two benzoxazine rings, two ester groups and two aliphatic hydroxyls. UV-curability was obtained through partial acylation of the aliphatic hydroxyls to form methacrylates. The modified benzoxazine monomer was then 3D printed via UV-assisted materials extrusion, with thermal post-treatment yielding complex parts composed of a fully cured polybenzoxazine vitrimer. The influence of the degree of methacrylation on vitrimer characteristics was explored with the aim of balancing photopolymerisation and printability with vitrimeric properties, as assessed by reshaping and recycling abilities. This work identifies an optimal benzoxazine precursor enabling the production of complex 3D printed vitrimer parts that can be reshaped and recycled, with a T alpha of 105 degrees C, a compressive modulus of 810 MPa and excellent dimensional stability. Ground 3D printed parts were used as viscosity modifiers for new prints, closing the successful recycling loop for this material.

ID STRATEGIES
AB Introduction In the last decades, 3D printing has demonstrated its potential across various sectors, including healthcare. However, there remains a notable gap in the integration of circular economy principles to recycle plastic waste into functional, high-quality 3D printing filaments, particularly in clinical settings. This work addresses this gap by exploring the sustainability of 3D printing in healthcare through the recycling of plastic waste into 3D printable filaments.Methods The process involves the collection, shredding, extrusion, and spooling of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) water bottle caps, collected from hospital setting. Key steps, such as extrusion and printing processes, were optimised, and the mechanical properties of the filament were thoroughly assessed. An economic and an environmental impact analysis was also conducted to evaluate the overall process. Optimization of each phase of the circular economy process led to the production of a functional recycled filament, with homogeneous diameter and surface finish quality.Results Despite HDPE being challenging to print, targeted adjustments significantly enhanced the print quality. The study not only aimed to obtain a usable filament but also to assess the economic and environmental impact of the whole process. The results indicated cost saving from in-house filament production compared to commercial options and a notable reduction in the environmental impact measured in carbon dioxide (CO2) emission equivalent. The recycled filament was successfully used to print a patient-specific anatomical model of an intracranial aneurysm, as a support for surgical planning.Discussion This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating sustainable 3D printing practices in healthcare, offering economics and environmental benefits while enhancing clinical support.

AB As part of a project that aims to provide people with disabilities with simple assistive devices in Colombia, the possibility of creating a PET filament that can be printed by Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) from beverage bottle waste was investigated, with the aim to remain as simple as possible in terms of plastic collection, sorting, processing, and printing. Recycled PET filaments were thus produced by extrusion from collected PET bottles, with the potential addition of HDPE, which comes from caps and rings. The microstructure, mechanical performance, and printing quality of parts produced with these filaments were investigated in comparison to commercial PET virgin and recycled filaments. HDPE presence as an immiscible blend did not affect the ease of extrusion or the quality of the printing, which were all satisfactory. In some conditions, the addition of 5 wt% of HDPE to recycled PET had a toughening effect on otherwise brittle samples. This behavior was attributed to the presence of elongated HDPE inclusions resulting from shear forces induced by the layer-by-layer printing, provided that the interface temperature remained high between layer depositions. This confirms that the mechanical performance of recycled PET is very sensitive to the processing conditions, especially in the case of 3D printing. Nonetheless, this low-cost process that did not require sophisticated compatibilization schemes allowed for the printing of parts with mechanical properties comparable to those obtained with high purity, commercially recycled filaments, opening interesting perspectives for a low-cost PET recycling process.

DE 3D printing waste; Distributed Waste Recycling; Service System
AB In recent years, desktop 3D printers have become popular due to their affordability and compact size, being used by designers for prototypes, students for models, and families for DIY projects. As 3D printing technology becomes more accessible, it has led to the development of localized community "FabStores" and promoted distributed manufacturing. Some researchers have suggested a distributed recycling system using 3D printing to process plastic waste within communities, reducing transportation-related losses. While 3D printing is often viewed as environmentally friendly, its widespread use generates significant transportation costs, including packaging and emissions. Additionally, the low entry barrier has increased consumer demand, leading to frequent user errors, unsatisfactory prints, and waste ending up in landfills. Many 3D printing users have recognized this issue and conducted research to address it. This paper explores 3D printing waste and examines how to transition toward a more environmentally sustainable 3D printing service system, including the development of a distributed waste recycling system through literature research, case studies, and internet data analysis.

AB 3D printing is a versatile technique to produce polymer mechanical parts. Acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) plastic has been widely used in fused deposition modeling (FDM), due to its good mechanical and thermoplastic properties. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of incorporating recycled ABS without compromising the mechanical integrity of pieces, by using a core-shell configuration. Test specimens with a virgin ABS shell and a recycled ABS infill are made with a commercial dual-extruder 3D printer. The impact of thermal extrusion cycles on the mechanical properties of ABS used in FDM 3D printing was evaluated. The results indicate a gradual decline in mechanical performance with increasing number of recycling cycles. However, specimens with a hybrid composition (virgin ABS shell and recycled ABS infill) maintained acceptable mechanical properties, demonstrating the potential of this approach for sustainable 3D printing practices. The findings highlight the viability of using recycled ABS in additive manufacturing, offering a sustainable approach without compromising structural integrity.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is 3D printing technology that is used in many fields in today's world. In dentistry, FDM is mainly used to produce dental models and appliances by using polymers in filament form. This study aimed to evaluate the usage of recycled nylon filament in terms of surface hardness, surface roughness and build-up thickness. In this study, the recycling process was conducted by polymer compounding extrusion machine at a temperature of 250 degrees C. Two groups of Nylon samples were used, control nylon and recycled nylon. Each group consisted of 10 specimens. The specimens were printed by Creality Ender 3 Neo FDM printer with printed standards followed for Nylon filament. The study samples were submitted to Shore D surface hardness test and surface roughness measurement, while the sample thickness values were recorded by digital caliper. The study results showed that the mean surface hardness was not significantly different after recycling, while surface roughness was significantly decreased for the recycled group. However, there was a significant increase in the specimens' thickness mean values. In conclusion, dental prosthetic work requires a high level of surface properties and accuracy. This study showed that recycled nylon filament would significantly improve surface roughness despite the increase in the printing layers' buildup thickness which can be managed digitally by proper setup of the printing parameters.

AB Recycled polyethylene terephthalate filament (R-PET) and recycled polypropylene filament (R-iPP) were successfully obtained from a recycling device called Polyformer which were reinforced with graphene oxide (GO) by dip-coating technique for use in 3D printing. The filaments were characterized by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) to obtain the main thermal transitions of the composite, such as its glass transition temperature (Tg), melting, and crystallization temperature (Tm and Tc, respectively). The specimens were printed according to ASTM D4065 standard and were characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) to observe the impact of graphene oxide as reinforcement on the storage modulus of the material. The thermomechanical results indicate enhanced performance of the iPP-G composite, exhibiting a 21% increase in storage modulus and a shift in the glass transition temperature (Tg), indicative of effective interfacial bonding between the graphene oxide and the recycled iPP matrix.Graphical abstract Reinforcement of recycled commodity polymers for 3D printing

AB ColdGlass is a new material and workflow for accessible, affordable, and full-color glass 3D printing. We present: 1) a recipe for a 3D printable glass paste, 2) software and hardware that enable 3D printing, and 3) a firing schedule for sintering printed parts into solid glass. We evaluate our recipe and firing schedule by comparing the look, feel, shrinkage, porosity, and density of a collection of printed objects. We then present a range of functional and decorative glass artifacts that we 3D printed from ColdGlass including earrings, tiled glass sheets, sculptures, and functional vessels. We also describe methods for reusing and recycling glass in our workflow. We conclude by discussing the unique affordances of ColdGlass and the creative opportunities it provides for digital fabrication, design, and HCI.

AB Rapid plastic consumption has increased global plastic waste, with polyethylene terephthalate (PET) widely used in packaging. Recycling PET is challenging, as conventional methods often fail to manage the growing waste stream. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a way to repurpose PET waste into useful products. Preserving the mechanical and physical properties of recycled PET (rPET) during printing is essential. This study used a design of experiments approach to optimize AM parameters, including nozzle temperature, bed temperature, and print speed. Mechanical tests evaluated tensile strength, Young's modulus, and failure strength. Results revealed optimal conditions that improve part quality and performance. The study identified optimal printing parameters that significantly enhance both dimensional accuracy and mechanical properties of rPET parts, validating their suitability for functional AM applications and advancing circular economy efforts.

AB The subject of composite waste from the wind turbine blades has become more serious and challenging. Inspired by the recent popularity of the 3D printing industry, this work presents a step-by-step recycling solution to manufacture fiber reinforced filaments for fused filament fabrication. Polylactic acid filaments reinforced with 3, 5, and 10 wt% recyclate content are manufactured and tested using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and micro computed tomography (mu CT). TGA results elucidate that an increase in the recyclate content translates into a reduction in the mean fiber length. Visualizing mu CT results, it is confirmed that fibers are predominantly aligned along the filament length. Tensile specimens per ASTM D636 standard are manufactured and tested with results showing an improvement of, respectively, 20% and 28% in the specific tensile strength and modulus compared with pure PLA samples. The mechanical performance of the newly introduced recycled parts is also assessed through a coherent set of theoretical models, where an excellent agreement between the experiments and predictions is observed.

AB This study concerns the evaluation of several properties/characteristics of 3D printed poly(lactic acid) (PLA) polymer and acrylonitrile-butadienestyrene (ABS) copolymer, recycled from food packages and car dashboards, respectively. The aim is to evaluate the potential of recycled polymers that are recovered from solid polymer waste (SPW) to be reused for functional components/parts for add-value applications. The study compared the performance of the recycled material with the obtained from the 3D printing of virgin polymer. The characterization was made considering the chemical, thermal and mechanical properties as well as surface roughness and wettability. Although the thermal characterization did not indicate significant variations between recycled and virgin material, the mechanical recycling process induced some chain scission in PLA.
   Consequently, the semi-crystalline polymer revealed losses of 33% both in tensile stress and flexural strength. On the contrary, recycled ABS did not show changes in the mechanical properties of the printed specimens. Both recycled polymers produced smoother surfaces with a decrease of the mean surface roughness between 55% and 65%. Considering the properties required by manufacturers of food containers and car dashboards, this study indicates that recycled materials can be reused for the same applications.

AB The reinforcement of polymers with carbon or glass fibers is the reason for their incredible success as ideal lightweight construction materials. However, one challenge with these materials is their recyclability. True recycling, meaning achieving the same performance level as virgin material, is impossible, especially with mechanical recycling processes, because the reinforcement structure is destroyed. Additionally, thermoplastics undergo molecular degradation and changes in the properties of the materials. Therefore, polymer fiber-reinforced plastics may have an advantage here, as polymer fibers are much more flexible than glass or carbon fibers. We investigated the production and recyclability of microfibrillar composites (MFCs) made of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The samples were produced using extrusion-based 3D printing with different parameters, and their morphology and mechanical properties were examined. The samples were crushed, and the residue was fed back into the production line. The process was repeated with the samples produced from regenerate. The results prove that the printing process can be controlled to ensure the presence of fibers in samples made from recycled material. However, it is important to note that the mechanical properties decrease with each additional processing cycle. The choice of manufacturing parameters, especially in 3D printing, is crucial for achieving good properties.

AB Vulcanized and devulcanized ground tire rubber microparticles have been used as a minor phase in acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer (ABS) and thermoplastic polyolefins (TPO) for the development of materials with desired functionalities by 3D printing. These polymers have been selected because they (i) present part of the plastic waste generated by the automotive industry and (ii) have totally different properties (ABS for its stiffness and robustness and TPO for its softness and ductility). The study aims to improve the circular economy of the automotive industry by proposing a promising route for recycling the generated tire rubber waste. In this respect, emergent technology for plastic processing such as 3D printing is used, as part of the additive manufacturing technologies for the prolongated end of life of recycled plastics originated from automotive waste such as ABS and TPO. The obtained results revealed that (i) the composites are suitable for successful filament production with desired composition and diameter required for successful 3D printing by fused deposition modeling, and that (ii) the optimization of the composition of the blends allows the production of materials with interesting mechanical performances. Indeed, some of the investigated ABS-recycled rubber tire blends exhibit high impact properties as TPO-based composites do, which in addition exhibits elongation at break higher than 500% and good compression properties, accompanied with good shape recovery ratio after compression.

ID ACID COMPOSITES
AB 3D printing enables sustainable product innovations through novel design, reduced use of materials, and local manufacturing. Sustainable 3D printing can further be realized using recyclable materials. Cellulose is an abundantly available renewable material. Modified celluloses, such as thermoplastic cellulose esters, are widely used in injection molding applications. The aim of this research was to study the properties of a cellulose-based composite (cellulose acetate propionate (CAP) polymer matrix with 20 wt. % microcellulose) in injection molding and granular extrusion-based 3D printing processes over multiple recycles. The impact of the processing methods on the composite's properties were investigated. Both injection molded and 3D printed samples were ground with plastic grinding mill to particle sizes below 3 mm after each preparation stage and reused as such in the next process cycle. Morphology, mechanical and thermal properties, and material degradation were analyzed. The thermoplastic cellulose-based compound was found to be directly recyclable for both processes without the need for any additional compounding steps. The polymer matrix was able to withstand at least seven processing cycles without degradation. However, microcellulose was found to be more sensitive to thermal stress. The mechanical and thermal properties of the cellulose-based composites remained close to initial levels throughout.

AB Some studies have reported the tertiary (3 degrees) recycling of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) with material extrusion (MEX) based 3D printing. As a melt flow index (MFI) based process, MEX has limitations concerning the amount of reinforcement in a polymer matrix. This study reports a novel 3D dispenser printing technique for 3 degrees recycling of PVDF that may allow higher composition/ proportion of reinforcement for sensing applications. The dispenser printing-based PVDF functional prototypes were prepared by dissolving PVDF granules in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and the gel was 3D printed as a substrate of 48 x 50 x 2 (mm) for a microstrip patch antenna (MPA). The 3 degrees recycling of PVDF involves a substantial difference between dispenser printing and MEX. The sensing capability of the PVDF substrate was explored using a ring resonator (RR) test, and its resonance frequency (Rf) was observed by using a Vector network analyzer (VNA). Further, its sensing capability in the industrial scientific and medical (ISM) band was explored using reverse transmission (S21), reflection coefficient (S11), and specific absorption ratio (SAR) values. The calculated values of S21, S11, and SAR for PVDF were -93.90493 dB, -10.17671 dB, and 1.175 W/kg, respectively. The results are supported by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).

AB Nowadays 3D printing has excellent potential and attention over the traditional manufacturing technology and has more recycling possibilities. The present study focuses on the conversion of 3D printing raft support waste from the Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process and this waste can be converted into usable ecofriendly composites using ultrasonic joining technique. The joining study was done on the 3D printed supports of Poly Lactic Acid (PLA), Carbon fibre reinforced Poly Lactic Acid (CPLA), and Ceramic reinforced Poly Lactic Acid (CEPLA) samples. The samples are welded with 6 different combinations such as similar welding of PLA, CPLA and CEPLA, and dissimilar welding of CEPLA/CPLA, CEPLA/PLA, and CPLA/PLA. Similar and dissimilar ultrasonic welding was done with respect to varying the printing process parameters such as layer height, raster orientation and printing speed. The impact of various printing parameters on the joint possessions of the 3D printed supports was analysed in terms of the mechanical properties such as tensile strength and shore hardness value. The results show that, the maximum tensile strength was observed on the similar joints of Carbon fibre reinforced Poly Lactic Acid (CPLA) samples with layer height of 0.1 mm, printing speed of 20 mm/s and raster orientation of 90 degrees. Fractured samples clearly shows that all the samples are failed under brittle mode of fracture and at lower printing speed the samples are evenly deposited, which results in proper bonding or fusion of the Joined raft support samples. This kind of refabrication method provides more benefit with lesser energy utilization compared to filament extrusion method for recycling of the 3D printed waste.

AB The amount of plastic waste generated is causing damage to the environment, such as sea and soil pollution, and one of the alternatives for disposing of polymers is recycling. This work proposes recycling expanded polystyrene using a biodegradable solvent, its plastification with glycerol, and the preparation of the composite with post-consumer recycled gypsum for applications to manufacturing by 3D printing and for finishing materials for construction. Specimen for tensile testing and shore D hardness were prepared by injection process and by 3D printing. In addition, Thermogravimetric (TG), Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), Differential scanning calorimeter, Scanning electron microscope (FESEM) analyses, and flame propagation tests were also carried out. TG and FTIR analyses show that the recycling process did not degrade the material, and the addition of glycerol and gypsum improved the thermal stability of the composite. The mechanical properties of the injected and 3D printed samples with gypsum were similar, due to the dimensional stability of the manufactured filament, which improved the speed and quality of the specimen printing. The increase in ductility and the reduction in the glass transition temperature showed that the recycled expanded polystyrene (RPS) were effectively plasticized with the addition of 2 wt% glycerol, preserving their flame self-extinguishment when subjected to the flame propagation test. Due to these properties, the plasticized RPS can be used to manufacture articles for finishing in civil construction, and the RPS composite can be used to manufacture 3D printed prototypes.

AB Multi-material 3D printing combines the functional properties of different materials (e.g., mechanical, electrical, color) within a single object that is fabricated without manual assembly. However, this presents sustainability challenges as multi-material objects cannot be easily recycled. Because each material has a different processing temperature, considerable effort must be used to separate them for recycling. This paper presents a computational fabrication technique to generate dissolvable interfaces between different materials in a 3D printed object without affecting the object's intended use. When the interfaces are dissolved, the object is disassembled to enable recycling of the individual materials. We describe the computational design of these interfaces alongside experimental evaluations of their strength and water solubility. Finally, we demonstrate our technique across 9 multi-material 3D printed objects of varying structural and functional complexity. Our technique enables us to recycle 89.97% of the total mass of these objects, promoting greater sustainability in 3D printing.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) and recycled PLA (Re-PLA) samples were produced using a 3D printer with 50 % fill rate, vertical and horizontal truss orientation, and layer thickness of 0.10, 0.15, and 0.20 mm. Mechanical, wear, and SEM analyses were performed. Results show that printing orientation has a stronger influence on tensile, bending, and compression strength than layer thickness. Vertically printed PLA and Re-PLA samples exhibited higher strength and ductility, while Re-PLA horizontal samples lacked a clear yield point. The highest hardness (76 shore D) was measured in PLA-V at 0.20 mm thickness. Surface roughness increased with layer thickness and was greater in horizontal and Re-PLA samples. Friction behavior varied by filament type and thickness, with 0.1 V samples showing the highest values. SEM images revealed brittle fractures in PLA and more ductile but structurally irregular fractures in Re-PLA, with more cracks and gaps-factors contributing to its reduced mechanical performance.

AB Plastic waste is a major concern for marine environment care, and many researchers and projects face the problem from different points of view. The European CircularSeas project aims to encourage the development of greener maritime industries through the combination of principles of Circular Economy, plastic recycling and 3D printing. However, while 3D printing has shown its benefits for conventional industry environments, the first issue discussed in this paper is whether 3D printing technology can also bring benefits to the maritime-port sector, where parts manufacturing, new prototyping trends and even product customization have not traditionally been major business issues. A secondary issue is how 3D printing and this specific user scenario could accommodate recycled plastic in a Circular Economy strategy in a feasible way. In an attempt to address both of these issues, the paper reviews some particularities of 3D printing open technologies and proposes a new integrated and user-oriented 3D printing framework, independent of hardware and adaptable to non-standard recycled plastic raw material from marine waste.

AB In this paper, a novel geometric model of plain weft knitted structures, considering self-supporting conditions and process requirements is first proposed for 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced nylon composite, where the material extrusion additive manufacturing of a plain weft knitted structure is realized. Next, a recycling process of 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced nylon composite plain weft knitted structures is developed, to obtain recycled filament that can be directly used for 3D printing. The scanning electron microscope micrographs and the interfacial performance of the composite parts, manufactured from the original filament and the recycled one, were compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the performance of the recycled filament is continuously improving, because the recovery process enhances the infiltration of the nylon matrix into the surface of the carbon fiber. In the same printing condition, the tensile strength of composite printed with recycled filament is 56 MPa, which is improved by 16.7% compared to the composite printed using the original filament.

AB This research validates the viability of a recycling and reusing process for end-of-life glass fiber reinforced wind turbine blades. Short glass fibers from scrap turbine blades are reclaimed and mixed with polylactic acid (PLA) through a double extrusion process to produce composite feedstock with recycled glass fibers for fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing. Reinforced filaments with different fiber contents, as high as 25% by weight, are extruded and used to 3D print tensile specimens per ASTM D638-14. For 25 wt% reinforcement, the samples showed up to 74% increase in specific stiffness compared to pure PLA samples, while there was a reduction of 42% and 65% in specific tensile strength and failure strain, respectively. To capture the level of impregnation of the non-pyrolyzed recycled fibers and PLA, samples made from reinforced filaments with virgin and recycled fibers are fabricated and assessed in terms of mechanical properties and interface. For the composite specimens out of reinforced PLA with recycled glass fibers, it was found that the specific modulus and tensile strength are respectively 18% and 19% higher than those of samples reinforced with virgin glass fibers. The cause for this observation is mainly attributed to the fact that the surface of recycled fibers is partially covered with epoxy particles, a phenomenon that allows for favorable interactions between the molecules of PLA and epoxy, thus improving the interface bonding between the fibers and PLA.

AB Dopamine readily adsorbs onto almost all kinds of surfaces and develops cohesive strength through self polymerization; hence, aqueous solutions of dopamine can be used as adhesives. These properties were used to prevent the degradation in the mechanical properties of recycled PLA fabricated by 3D printer. The mechanical properties of 3D printed PLA play a critical role in determining its applications. To reduce the manufacturing cost as well as environmental pollutants, recycling of 3D printed materials has attracted many attentions. However, recycling of polymeric materials causes the degradation of the mechanical properties. Our study is aimed at advancing the current knowledge on the adhesion behavior of polydopamine coatings on PLA pellets used in 3D printing process. Polydopamine was synthesized by oxidative polymerization and used to coat PLA specimens. The adhesion behavior and mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens were evaluated by tensile tests. It was found that the mechanical properties of recycled specimen with polydopamine coating have been improved. Microstructural and chemical characterization of the coated specimens was carried out using FE-SEM, FTIR, and XPS analyses. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a highly automated platform that facilitates material deposition in a layer-by-layer approach to fabricate pre-defined 3D complex structures on demand. It is a highly promising technique for the fabrication of personalized medical devices or even patient-specific tissue constructs. Each type of 3D printing technique has its unique advantages and limitations, and the selection of a suitable 3D printing technique is highly dependent on its intended application. In this review paper, we present and highlight some of the critical processes (printing parameters, build orientation, build location, and support structures), material (batch-to-batch consistency, recycling, protein adsorption, biocompatibility, and degradation properties), and regulatory considerations (sterility and mechanical properties) for 3D printing of personalized medical devices. The goal of this review paper is to provide the readers with a good understanding of the various key considerations (process, material, and regulatory) in 3D printing, which are critical for the fabrication of improved patient-specific 3D printed medical devices and tissue constructs.

AB Recyclable 3D printing of thermosets was realized by utilizing the solvent-assisted recycling of covalent adaptable networks (CANs). The printouts, if damaged or after usage, were fully depolymerized in an organic solvent, and they were partially cured into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. This work presents fundamental studies to understand the influences of ink composition and rheological properties on the printability, recyclability, and thermomechanical properties of printed CAN components. A polyimine-based CAN is used as the material platform for the direct-ink-writing (DIW) 3D printing, which exhibits lower processing temperature and catalyst-free features. This study reveals that the incorporation of nano-clay maintains the recyclability, malleability, and thermomechanical properties of polyimines, and it dramatically improves the shear modulus and yielding stress of inks for the 3D printing of complex structures with dangling features. The developed inks are shown to be recycled five times and still retain an excellent printability. The 3D-printed polymer structures usually exhibit notable anisotropic mechanical properties due to their weak interfaces. However, the DIW printing of CANs is shown to create structures with comparable properties in different printing directions because of the strong interfaces connected by covalent bonds. It, thus, possesses the great potential to tackle this long-standing challenge in the 3D printing field.

AB Electronic waste (e-waste) plastics from end-of-life printers, predominantly polycarbonate, were upcycled and transformed into sustainable 3D printing filaments. Results from mechanical testing indicate that the e-waste plastics filaments and its 3D prints exhibit up to 76 and 83% of breaking and tensile strength respectively of its virgin counterparts produced from a widely used plastic for 3D printing, i.e., ABS. The 3D prints from e-waste plastic were more flexible compared to those from virgin plastics. SEM analysis of the fractured surface of the 3D prints post tensile testing is also presented in the paper. Furthermore, LCA studies on our filament production process indicate 28% reduction in CO2 emissions while using e-waste plastics as feedstock as compared to virgin plastics. Effects of repeated recycling, up to four extrusion cycles, on the virgin and e-waste plastic filaments were studied, and a comprehensive semiquantitative degradation mechanism for the same was proposed using results from C-13 NMR and TGA analysis.

AB 3D printing of polymeric materials for various applications has been quickly developed in recent years. In contrast to thermoplastics, 3D printed thermosets, although desirable, are inherently non-recyclable due to their permanently crosslinked networks. As 3D printing is becoming more popular, it is desirable to develop recycling approaches for 3D printed parts in view of increasing polymer wastes. Here, we present a new thermosetting vitrimer epoxy ink and a 3D printing method that can 3D print epoxy into parts with complicated 3D geometries, which later can be recycled into a new ink for the next round of 3D printing. In the first printing cycle, a high-viscous ink is first slightly cured and is then printed at an elevated temperature into complicated 3D structures, followed by an oven cure using a two-step approach. To be recycled, the printed epoxy parts are fully dissolved in an ethylene glycol solvent in a sealed container at a high temperature. The dissolved polymer solution is reused for the next printing cycle using similar printing conditions. Our experiments demonstrate that the ink can be printed four times and still retains very good printability. In addition, the vitrimer epoxy can be used for pressure-free repairs for the 3D printed parts.

AB The disposal of post-consumer glass has been a major issue due to its inert properties that may cause environmental effects, while recycling of these glasses is only feasible if the waste glass recovered is sorted into its different colour to prevent chemical incompatibility in the manufacturing process. 3D printing in building and construction has gain increasing attention in the past decade and provides a potential to sustainably utilize the recycled unsorted glasses. This paper examines the use of recycled glass as the fine aggregates for 3D concrete printing applications. Despite the several studies done on the use of recycled glass in concrete, there is a lack of focus on the rheology of the material which is essential to the performance of the material in 3D concrete printing. Although results have shown that the mechanical strength for the recycled glass concrete is lower than the sand aggregates concrete, yet the flow properties of the former is better than the latter. Nonetheless, a balance between the mechanical strength and flowability of the mix design should be studied. The future work revolves around the optimization of the mix design using a combination of sand and recycled glass, adjusting the gradation of recycled glass particles and addition of accelerators to improve its buildability and mechanical strengths.

ID PRODUCTION/RECYCLING MODEL; SUSTAINABILITY
AB In recent years, additive manufacturing technologies have been playing an important role in the global economy. Consequently, low-cost 3D printers rose in the domestic environment, accelerating the development of startup companies and new market segments. Nevertheless, with regard to 3D printing based on fused filament fabrication, several challenges still need to be overcome, such as those related to surface finishing and mechanical strength. Moreover, 3D printing in the domestic environment also generates untreated plastic waste, which can cause environmental problems. For these reasons, the main goal of this work is to introduce and characterise 3D printing surface finishing post-processing using recycled plastic waste. As the main results of this work, the proposed recycling process was confirmed to improve object properties. Whereas surface roughness was reduced from 27 to 3 mu m, while mechanical strength was increased in 20 times. The application of recycled material for chemical welding was also seen to be feasible.

AB Recycling of rare earth elements, such as Sm and Nd, is one technique towards mitigating long-term supply and cost concerns for materials and devices that depend on these elements. In this work recycled Sm-Co powder recovered from industrial grinding swarfs, or waste material from magnet processing, was investigated for use in preparation of filament for 3D printing of bonded magnets. Recycled Sm-Co powder recovered from swarfs was blended into polylactic acid (PLA). Up to 20 vol.% of the recycled Sm-Co in PLA was extruded at 160 degrees C to produce a filament. It was demonstrated that no degradation of magnetic properties occurred due to the preparation or extrusion of the bonded magnet material. Good uniformity of the magnetic properties is exhibited throughout the filament, with the material first extruded being the exception. The material does exhibit some magnetic anisotropy, allowing for the possibility of the development of anisotropic filaments. This work provides a path forward for producing recycled magnetic filament for 3D printing of permanent magnets. (C) 2018 Author(s).

AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) and 3D printing are drivers for material savings in manufacturing. Owing to the continuous diffusion of 3D printing driven by low-cost entry-level material extrusion printers, sustainability of a so popular AM technology is of paramount importance. Therefore, recycling 3D printed wastes and 3D parts again at the end of their life is an important issue to be addressed. Research efforts are directed towards the improvement of the biodegradability of 3D printing filaments and the replacement of oil based feedstock with bio-based compostable plastics. The aim of this work is to describe the state of the art about development and use of recycled or biodegradable filaments in 3D printing. Beyond a critical review of the literature, open issues and research opportunities are presented.

AB The high volume of plastic waste and the extremely low recycling rate have created a serious challenge worldwide. Local distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) offers a solution by economically incentivizing local recycling. One DRAM technology capable of processing large quantities of plastic waste is fused granular fabrication, where solid shredded plastic waste can be reused directly as 3D printing feedstock. This study presents an experimental assessment of multi-material recycling printability using two of the most common thermoplastics in the beverage industry, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and the feasibility of mixing PET and HDPE to be used as a feedstock material for large-scale 3-D printing. After the material collection, shredding, and cleaning, the characterization and optimization of parameters for 3D printing were performed. Results showed the feasibility of printing a large object from rPET/rHDPE flakes, reducing production costs by up to 88%.Highlights Study: multi-material recycling printability of PET-HDPE.

ID THERMOPLASTIC COMPOSITES; PERFORMANCE
AB A cleaner production pattern for high-performance continuous carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) has been proposed on the base of recycling and remanufacturing of 3D printed continuous carbon fiber reinforced (CFR) PLA composites. Continuous carbon fiber and PLA matrix was recycled in the form of PLA impregnated carbon fiber filament from 3D printed composite components and reused as the raw material for further 3D printing process. The original printing trajectory is reversely applied, allowing for a 100% recycling of the continuous fiber without any effect on the mechanical properties. Tensile performance of recycled carbon fiber filaments was evaluated, which was higher than that of originally printed composites. Remanufactured CFRTPCs specimens also exhibited a 25% higher bending strength than that of original ones, which experimentally demonstrated the first non-downgrade recycling process for CFRTPCs. A material recovery rate of 100% for continuous carbon fiber and 73% for PLA matrix were achieved for a better environmental impact. Energy consumption of 67.7 and 66 MJ/kg respectively for recycling and remanufacturing processes was detected and compared with conventional methods. The proposed cleaner production pattern offered a potential strategy for the low-cost industrial application of fully recyclable composites. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The large-scale retirement and high recycling difficulty of wind turbine blades (WTB) pose great challenges to environment and society. To explore the practical applicability of recycled WTB in 3D printed concrete (3DCP), a systematic experimental study was conducted on the printability and physical -mechanical properties of 3DCP incorporating RWTB fiber. The distribution of RWTB fiber and porosity were analyzed using X-ray CT scan and Scanning Electron Microscopy, with the aim of unveiling the reinforcing and anisotropic mechanisms of 3DCP with RWTB fiber. The concrete with 3% -7% of RWTB fiber presented good extrudability and buildability, although slightly decreased the fluidity. Due to the directional effect and the layer -by -layer stacking process inherent in 3D printing, the RWTB fiber exhibited enhanced alignment along the printing direction, leading to modifications in the porosity. Incorporating 5% RWTB fiber in 3DCP significantly improved mechanical properties, with notable increases of 13.2% -29.9% in unconfined compressive strength and up to 147.4% -465.4% in bending toughness in the Y and Z loading directions, as compared to samples without fiber. Moreover, the mechanical anisotropy of 3DCP with RWTB fiber was less significant than that with the fiber having higher tensile strength, leading to a promising way to repurpose WTB and promote sustainability of 3DCP.

AB Post-consumer glass existing in co-mingled waste to be used for landfill poses a serious environmental issue due to its non-biodegradable nature. Therefore, glass materials are often extracted and recycled for other applications. The building and construction (B&C) field present an attractive application for recycled glass as replacement of fine aggregates in cementitious materials, the second most consumed material in the world after water. With the growth in interest towards 3D printing for the B&C field in recent years, much research has been conducted with respect to 3D cementitious material printing (3DCMP). 3DCMP has gained its stand in the B&C field as it does not require any formwork and human intervention and permits designing for structural optimization. Hence, with the accompanying advantages of both 3DCMP and the need for recycling glass waste, this study aims to replace the fine aggregates of the cementitious material by the processed recycled glass to be used for 3D printing. This paper studies the gradation of the recycled glass aggregates in the 3D printable cementitious material. Three different gradations were designed using the different particle size of recycled glass materials supplied and investigated using the same binder mix design. For each gradation, the fresh and hardened properties were investigated. Printing investigations were also conducted on the studied recycled glass gradations.

AB Old additively manufactured one-shotsensing platforms arerecycled into two new filaments for 3D printing: one conductive andone non-conductive. These filaments are used to print a fully recycledcell, in an identical design, that matches the original cell in electroanalyticalperformance toward the detection of acetaminophen. This feeds intothe concept of an electrochemistry circular economy.
   Recycling used mixedmaterial additively manufactured electroanalyticalsensors into new 3D-printing filaments (both conductive and non-conductive)for the production of new sensors is reported herein. Additively manufactured(3D-printed) sensing platforms were transformed into a non-conductivefilament for fused filament fabrication through four different methodologies(granulation, ball-milling, solvent mixing, and thermal mixing) withthermal mixing producing the best quality filament, as evidenced bythe improved dispersion of fillers throughout the composite. Utilizingthis thermal mixing methodology, and without supplementation withthe virgin polymer, the filament was able to be cycled twice beforefailure. This was then used to process old sensors into an electricallyconductive filament through the addition of carbon black into thethermal mixing process. Both recycled filaments (conductive and non-conductive)were utilized to produce a new electroanalytical sensing platform,which was tested for the cell's original application of acetaminophendetermination. The fully recycled cell matched the electrochemicaland electroanalytical performance of the original sensing platform,achieving a sensitivity of 22.4 +/- 0.2 mu A mu M-1, a limit of detection of 3.2 +/- 0.8 mu M, and a recoveryvalue of 95 +/- 5% when tested using a real pharmaceutical sample.This study represents a paradigm shift in how sustainability and recyclingcan be utilized within additively manufactured electrochemistry towardpromoting circular economy electrochemistry.

AB 3D printing is one of the plastic recycling processes that deliver a mechanically sustainable product and may be used for 4D printing applications, such as self-assembly, sensors, actuators, and other engineering applications. The success and implementation of 4D printing are dependent on the tendency of the shape memory with the action of external stimuli, such as heat, force, fields, light, and pH. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) are the most common materials for fused filament fabrication-based 3D printing processes. However, the low-shaped memory tendency on heating and weaker and less rigidity of ABS limit the application domains. PLA is an excellent responsive behavior when the action of heat has high stiffness. The incorporation of PLA into ABS is one of the solutions to tune the shape memory effect for better applicability in the 4D printing domain. In this study, the primary recycled PLA was incorporated into the primary recycled ABS matrix from 5 to 40% (weight%), and composites were made by extrusion in the form of cylindrical filaments for 4D printing. The tensile and shape memory properties of the recycled ABS-PLA composites were investigated to select the best combination. The results of the study were supported by fracture analysis by shape memory analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and optical microscopy. This study revealed that the prepared ABS-PLA-based composites have the potential to be applied in self-assembly applications.

AB The traditional 3Rs - "Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle" provide an effective measure to reduce consumption rates of natural resources. This process is however considered as "down-cycling". The quality of recycled materials degrades over time with waste accumulation. To minimize or even eliminate waste accumulation, a Cradle to Cradle (R) design framework for 3D-printed products interconnecting five elements - plastic recycling, pre-treatment, extrusion to filaments, 3D printing and users, is hereby proposed. The ultimate goal is to essentially prevent any generation of wastes via healthy, regenerative and cost-effective manufacturing cycles that consider materials as assets. A distributed recycling platform for 3D printed products with an international recycling code system is recommended to help the recirculation of regenerated materials. Utilisation of renewable energy and water stewardship are also suggested to reduce both carbon and water footprints. Finally, a standard certification system for 3D printing filaments is also crucial to improve extrusion and 3D printing processes using shredded recycled plastics.

AB The use of recycled polymers in additive manufacturing (AM), a. k.a. three-dimensional printing (3DP), has gained recognition recently due to its potential to minimize plastic waste and support sustainable manufacturing practices. Recycled polymers offer numerous benefits and potential uses in 3DP, making them an attractive option for sustainable production and waste management practices. Reinforcements can enhance the properties of recycled polymers, allowing for the production of complex objects with diverse properties. Optimizing printing parameters is crucial for understanding the specific needs of each material to enhance recycling outcomes and preserve material integrity. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current knowledge on 3DP using recycled polymers, chemical and mechanical recycling methods, and the effects of reinforcements, multiple recycling cycles, and printing parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed objects. Despite progress, research gaps remain regarding economic feasibility, environmental impact, and long-term durability. Filling these gaps could unlock the full potential of 3DP with recycled polymers and support the transition towards a circular economy.

AB Sustainable manufacturing practices are becoming increasingly necessary due to the growing concerns regarding climate change and resource scarcity. Consequently, material recycling technologies have gradually become preferred over conventional processes. This study aimed to recycle waste polylactic acid (PLA) from household-disposed cups and lids to create 3D-printed parts and promote sustainable manufacturing practices. To achieve this, the current study utilised virgin and post-consumer PLA (PC-PLA) (sourced from household waste) blends. The PC-PLA wastes were shredded and sorted by size with the aid of a washing step, resulting in a filament with a 1.70 +/- 0.5 mm diameter without fragmentation or dissolution. A 50:50 wt.% blend of virgin PLA (vPLA) and PC-PLA was selected as the standard recycling percentage based on previous research and resource conservation goals. The study investigated the impact of three 3D printing parameters (layer height (LH), infill density (I), and nozzle temperature (NT)) on the quality of 3D-printed parts using a three-level L9 Taguchi orthogonal array. The findings revealed that blending PC-PLA with vPLA led to significant improvements in tensile, flexural, and impact strengths by 18.40%, 8%, and 9.15%, respectively, compared to those of recycled PLA (rPLA). This conclusion was supported by the investigation of the fracture surface area, which revealed fractographic features associated with printing parameters, such as plastic deformation and interfilament debonding. An ANOVA analysis revealed a positive influence of a greater layer height and high nozzle temperature on mechanical properties. Subsequently, the optimal printing parameters (LH: 0.3 mm, I: 100%, and NT: 215 degrees C) were determined using the S/N ratio, and a confirmation test using the optimum printing parameters exhibited a strong correlation with the statistically predicted outcomes. Finally, the study used optimum printing parameters to fabricate 100% PC-PLA 3D-printed parts, demonstrating their potential for low-strength applications. The findings suggest that employing vPLA and PC-PLA blended filaments for fabricating 3D-printed components presents an effective means of promoting plastic recycling within a closed-loop recycling system and achieving a circular economy.

AB With a view to achieving sustainable development and a circular economy, this work focused on the possibility to valorize a secondary waste stream of recycled carbon fiber (rCF) to produce a 3D printing usable material with a PA6,6 polymer matrix. The reinforcing fibers implemented in the research are the result of a double-recovery action: starting with pyrolysis, long fibers are obtained, which are used to produce non-woven fabrics, and subsequently, fiber agglomerate wastes obtained from this last process are ground in a ball mill. The effect of different amounts of reinforcement at 5% and 10% by weight on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed thermoplastic composites was investigated. Although the recycled fraction was successfully integrated in the production of filaments for 3D printing and therefore in the production of specimens via the fused deposition modeling technique, the results showed that fibers did not improve the mechanical properties as expected, due to an unsuitable average size distribution and the presence of a predominant dusty fraction ascribed to the non-optimized ball milling process. PA6,6 + 10 wt.% rCF composites exhibited a tensile strength of 59.53 MPa and a tensile modulus of 2.24 GPa, which correspond to an improvement in mechanical behavior of 5% and 21% compared to the neat PA6,6 specimens, respectively. The printed composite specimens loaded with the lowest content of rCF provided the greatest improvement in strength (+9% over the neat sample). Next, a prediction of the "optimum" critical length of carbon fibers was proposed that could be used for future optimization of recycled fiber processing.

AB Additive manufacturing (3D printing) can transform low-income societies with underdeveloped infrastructure and inadequate manufacturing capabilities. However, uptake in sub-Saharan Africa is still very low. This study adopted a transdisciplinary approach which included critical synthesis of the extant literature, laboratory experiment and a cross sectional engagement with stakeholders, to examine the potential of converting plastic waste to 3D printed products in sub-Saharan Africa. The study showed that while several extruders have been developed in the last decade, there are still many challenges some of which include difficulty to produce filaments with consistent diameter, degraded mechanical properties and health hazards from emissions during extrusion. Furthermore, it was observed that communities across sub-Saharan Africa are interested in 3D printing but do not have sufficient understanding. The study highlights the need for building local capacity to develop, operate and maintain technologies associated with 3D printing.

AB This study presents an upscaling re-use strategy for a recycled thermoplastic which is obtained starting from a chemical recycling approach for a bio-based fully-recyclable epoxy resin system. The recycling approach used relies on the selective cleaving of the epoxy-cured network under mild conditions. The re-use strategy proposed in this work consists in the use of the recycled thermoplastic (rTP), as obtained at the end of the recycling process and without any additional treatments, as raw material for a 3D printing process falling within the material extrusion category. The used 3D printing technique relies on the use of a thermoplastic printhead equipped with a metallic cartridge, fillable with the rTP material, to which a suitable pressure value is applied in order to start the extrusion process. The recycled material is characterized through thermal and rheological analysis in order to find the correct printing conditions, such as extrusion temperature and pressure applied. Next, the printability of specimens having different type of infill is investigated and the mu CT analysis is used to evaluate the quality of the 3D printed samples.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA), recognized for its biodegradable and biocompatible attributes, serves as a popular choice for 3D printing filaments. However, its properties undergo transformations upon recycling. This study aimed to elucidate the specific effects of varying extrusion temperatures and screw speeds on the mechanical strength and dimensional properties of recycled PLA filaments. For the purpose of this study, recycled PLA pellets (3D850D) were processed using a single filament extruder machine, with the extrusion temperature set between 145 and 165 degrees C, and the screw speed ranging from 2 to 6 rpm. The produced filaments were then 3D printed into test samples using a 0 degrees raster angle, line infill pattern, and a complete, 100% infill density. These samples were then tested in compliance with ASTM D790 mechanical standards. The study's findings unveiled a significant correlation between extrusion parameters (extrusion temperature and screw speed) and the filament's ultimate flexural strength, yield strength, and diameter. It was found that an extrusion temperature of 155 degrees C coupled with a screw speed of 5 rpm led to the highest mechanical strengths. Moreover, these conditions also yielded filament diameters most comparable with commercial standards. These findings underscore the potential for enhancing the properties of recycled PLA filaments through the precise control of extrusion parameters. As a result, this study bolsters the prospect of using recycled PLA filaments in the 3D printing industry as a sustainable, performance-optimized material, marking a significant step toward eco-friendly additive manufacturing practices.

AB Wind turbines are important for clean electric energy, but the increasing number of end-of-life wind turbine blades has become a hazardous waste problem worldwide. A novel recycling approach based on mechanical grinding and combined with 3D printing techniques is a promising solution that will reduce waste at a low cost while retaining the excellent mechanical properties of recycled fabricated samples. Considering the material structure complexity of 3D printed samples, the Representative Volume Element (RVE) is a promising simulation model. This paper proposes a Modified Random Sequential Adsorption (MRSA) algorithm for the efficient generation of RVEs with hybrid and arbitrary-geometry reinforcements. Compared with the classical RSA algorithm, MRSA is advantageous in fiber intersection computational cost. The error between FEA and experiments is lower than results obtained from Mori-Tanaka and Halpin-Tsai. The effects of fiber content, fiber aspect ratio, fiber orientation and local fiber density are discussed. The model will be helpful for accurately predicting properties of 3D printing materials that use recycled wind turbine waste.

AB The rapid advancement of additive manufacturing (AM) technology, combined with the growing accumulation of plastic waste, has generated significant interest in utilizing materials derived from plastic waste and their composites within the AM industry. This paper examines the methods and approaches currently employed in recycling and blending thermoplastic waste into additive manufacturing feedstocks, aiming to enhance understanding and guide future advancements in this field. A systematic literature review including 82 papers from 2014 to 2024 was performed using the Scopus and Web of Science databases. The review findings indicate that approximately 83 % of the research is concentrated in production of new materials combining various polymer waste with recycled bio-sourced materials, recycled fillers or other additives for property enhancement. The evaluation and characterization of these new materials was carry out mostly using 3D printing, predominantly employing fused filament fabrication technology (63 %). The remaining 17 % focus on the improvement of the printing quality and optimization, development or adaptation of 3D printers for the utilization of new materials, and material reprocessability. This review highlight the need of evaluating the behavior of recycled blends over multiple life cycles, the cost and environmental assessments, and primary end-use applications of these materials, including as well as further development and design of printers.

AB This article focuses on the possibility of using biodegradable polymer-composite materials in additive manufacturing via fused deposition modelling (FDM) 3D printing. The main objective was to experimentally verify the technical feasibility of the repeated use of recycled PLA and PLA composites containing 10% natural coffee-ground (CG) filler in a print-degradation-recycling-print cycle. Special attention was paid to simulated ultraviolet radiation as a degradation factor affecting the materials' mechanical properties. Pure PLA and PLA_CG were compared at four levels of degradation time and after subsequent recycling. The results show that the inclusion of coffee-ground filler slightly reduces the initial strength but enhances the 3D-printed material's resistance to UV degradation and thus extends its functional service life. Unlike pure PLA, which loses its processability after 12 weeks, PLA_CG retains structural integrity and mechanical functionality. The research confirms the potential of recycled PLA composites with natural fillers for sustainable manufacturing and supports their use within a circular economy framework.

AB An innovative recycling method that does not require separation of the reinforcement and matrix is been pro-posed based on 3D printing of continuous fiber self-reinforced composites. The continuous fiber self-reinforced polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) composites were mechanically ground and directly remanufactured by screw extrusion 3D printing. The recycling procedure was accelerated and the thermal processing of the material was reduced. This recycling paradigm of self-reinforced composites with in-situ resource utilization is ideally suited to the space environment. The recycled self-reinforced composites showed no significant loss in tensile properties and even exhibited a slight increase after multiple recycling cycles owing to the melted PPS fiber in comparison with original PPS matrix. Since recycled material didn't separate the fiber from the matrix, its flexural strength and modulus increased by 34.11% and 51.81%, respectively, when compared to original PPS matrix. Molecular structure, rheological changes, and crystallization behavior were systematically investigated to elaborate the thermal degradation mechanism of recycled composites. The results obtained from systematical characterizations indicated that the recycled composites formed the cross-linking structure when subjected to multiple screw extrusion processing. The energy consumption of the screw extrusion-based 3D printing method was also con-ducted. The total energy intensity of recycling and remanufacturing processes were only about 17.9 MJ/kg. Spatial suitability, considering the advantages of self-reinforced composite recycling for space applications, were analyzed. Finally, theoretical material recovery rate of 100% for self-reinforced composites opens the prospect to reduce maintenance logistics in space. A future application scenario for fully recyclable self-reinforced composites in space was explored.

AB Traditional casting methods are losing their appeal due to poor working conditions. Integrating additive manufacturing into traditional Casting is a popular solution. Among the seven additive manufacturing categories, binder jet 3D printing is most suitable for 3D printing sand molds. However, issues like waste management and environmental problems in binder jetting need to be solved. The investigation proves that utilizing recycled sand as a raw material for 3D printing sand products can reduce the environmental impacts associated with binder jet 3D printing while achieving adequate mechanical properties. This study shows that recycled sand can produce mechanical properties comparable to new sand, while reducing waste and environmental impact. The study examines samples of new sand and recycled sand obtained from one to nine cycles of recycling. It reveals that the compressive and flexural strengths of sand recycled one to three times outperform new sand, while surface hardness remains unaffected by the recycling cycle. However, the permeability of the sand decreases as the number of recycling cycles increases. Recycled sand required less binder and hardener, which reduced costs and improved the environmental impact. This study highlights the importance of waste management and sustainability in 3D-printed sand mold processes and offers a promising solution for recycled sand powders in binder jetting.

AB The use of recovered materials in building construction is one of the most effective strategies for reducing the environmental impacts of the construction sector. Innovative technologies such as 3D construction printing can be applied in combination with recycling strategies in order to optimise their performances also from an environmental point of view. In fact, several studies have proposed the processing of waste material into printable material. At the same time, performance studies must be conducted on the building components produced by these methods. This study proposes a methodological approach to design a 3D printable building component made with recycled materials considering the improvement of thermal performances. In particular, the approach is based on three steps: reuse strategy conception; target performance definition, modelling and iterative simulation; 3D printing setting. The methodological approach has been applied to a 3D printable block using as printable material a cement-based mortar with recycled aggregates and recycled insulating material. As a result, the component's shape (interlocking and inspired by honeycombs) can be customised to achieve the required thermal performance by using recycled materials in the printing process.

AB The rapid technical evolution of additive manufacturing (AM) enables a new path to a circular economy using distributed recycling and production. This concept of Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is related to the use of recycled materials by means of mechanical recycling process in the 3D printing process chain. This paper aims to examine the current advances on thermoplastic recycling processes via additive manufacturing technologies. After proposing a closed recycling global chain for DRAM, a systematic literature review including 92 papers from 2009 to 2019 was performed using the scopus, web of science and springer databases. This work examines main topics from six stages (recovery, preparation, compounding, feedstock, printing, quality) of the proposed DRAM chain. The results suggested that few works have been done for the recovery and preparation stages, while a great progress has already been done for the other stages in order to validate the technical feasibility, environmental impact, and economic viability. Potential research paths in the pre-treatment of recycled material at local level and printing chain phases were identified in order to connect the development of DRAM with the circular economy ambition at micro, meso and macro level. The development of each stage proposed using the open source approach is a relevant path to scale DRAM to reach the full technical potential as a centerpiece of the circular economy.

AB This study explores the potential of polycarbonate (PC) using a novel 3D printing technique such as fused granulate fabrication (FGF), focusing on the effects of multiple recycling cycles on thermal stability, mechanical properties and microstructural integrity. Thermal stability analysis of FGF-printed recycled polycarbonate (rPC) shows a 12.5 % decrease in glass transition temperature (Tg) and slight degradation in onset degradation temperature Tonset after 10 recycling cycles. FTIR spectra shows initial improvements in the rPC structure after the 1st cycle, followed by degradation in subsequent cycles, confirming chain scission and reduced functional groups. Mechanical testing indicates that tensile strength increases from 54.96 MPa at the 1st cycle-68.59 MPa at the 3rd cycle due to improved polymer chain alignment but reduced significantly to 27.31 MPa by the 10th cycle due to degradation. The maximum flexural strength of 76.4 MPa was oberved at the 3rd cycleand then begins to decline from the 5th onwards. Impact strength shows a steady decrease, from 3.29 kJ/m2 at the 1st cycle-2.4 kJ/m2 at the 10th cycle, reflecting molecular breakdown and reduced ductility. Fracture surface analysis reveals a transition from ductile to brittle failure as the number of recycling cycles increased. In terms of 3D printing efficiency, FGF significantly reduced printing time compared to fused filament fabrication (FFF), with up to an 84 % time saving, demonstrating the FGF potential as a cost-effective and sustainable alternative for rPC. These results contribute to comprehensively understanding the trade-offs and benefits of using rPC in Additive Manufacturing, providing insights into the sustainable use of rPC for FGF-printed products.

AB The recycling of filaments used in three-dimensional (3D) printing systems not only mitigates the environmental issues associated with conventional 3D printing approaches but also simultaneously reduces manufacturing costs. This study investigates the effects of successive recycling of polylactic acid (PLA) filaments, which were used in the printing process, on the mechanical properties of recycled filaments and printed objects. The mechanical strengths of the printed PLA and the adhesion strengths between 3D-printed beads were evaluated via the tensile testing of the horizontally and vertically fabricated specimens. Gel permeation chromatography analysis revealed a reduction in the molecular weight of the polymer as a result of recycling, leading to a decrease in the mechanical strength of the 3D-printed product. Additionally, scanning electron microscopy images of the cutting plane showed that the fabricated beads were broken in the case of the horizontally fabricated specimen, whereas in the case of the vertically fabricated samples, the adhesion between the beads was weak. These findings indicate that the mechanical strength in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions must be improved by increasing the mechanical strength of the bead itself as well as the adhesion strength of the beads.

AB Sustainability is critical nowadays, with a growing interest in polymers, due to their increasing usage in products. Mechanical recycling of polymers involves grinding/shredding and thermal extrusion of the material. This is a thermomechanical process, which negatively affects the bulk mechanical performance of the polymer and may potentially introduce contamination. This work investigates the response of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) in material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing, after multiple recycling courses. Each course comprises two thermal cycles, one in the extruder for filament fabrication and a second one in the 3D printer's nozzle, for the manufacturing of the parts, following corresponding standards. The response of the material after up to six repetitions of the process was studied in this work. In each repetition, the effect of the process on the mechanical (tensile, flexural, impact, microhardness, Dynamic Mechanical Analysis), thermal (Thermogravimetric Analysis), morphological (Scanning Electron Microscopy), and structural (Micro X-Ray Computed Tomography Scanning & Analysis) behavior of the material was studied. The results of the study show a reasonable potential for the sustainability of the TPU material, exploiting 3D printing advantages. The highest tensile strength is reported in the sixth repetition of the thermal reprocessing of the material, indicating that TPU mechanical recycling is a viable option.

AB This paper presents a feasibility study for the production of recycled glycol modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) material for additive manufacturing. Past studies showed a variety of results for the recycling of 3D-printing material, therefore the precise effect on the material properties is not completely clear. For this work, PETG waste of the same grade was recycled once and further processed into 3D printing filament. The study compares three blend ratios between purchased plastic pellets and recycled pellets to determine the degradation effect of one recycling cycle and possible blend ratios to counter these effects. Furthermore, the results include a commercially available filament. The comparison uses the filament diameter, the dimensional accuracy of the printed test specimen and mechanical properties as quality criteria. The study shows that the recycled material has a minor decrease concerning the tensile strength and Young's modulus.

AB Different percentages of talc were added to polypropylene deriving from pristine surgical masks in a small scale extrusion equipment to confer specific rheological and thermal properties to the resulting materials. This is not a fully satisfactory solution, thus the quantity of masks has been partially replaced by a first-use polypropylene copolymer. Two selected formulations with 35 and 50 wt% of material deriving from pristine masks and 30 wt% of talc have been identified as suitable for the 3D printing process.Finally, the formulations were scaled up with a lab twin-screw extruder and by recycling sanitized after use masks to be as close as possible to field recycling conditions. The extruded pellets were processed to produce printing filament and finally validated as extrusion material for 3D printing. 3D printed tensile specimens were characterized for the mechanical properties and observed for their microstructure even comparing them with a commercial 3D printable material. For the first time is verified that a 3D printable extrusion material recycled from the disposable face masks can be obtained and shows comparable stiffness and strength to a commercial one.

AB The continuous demand for thermoplastic polymers in a great variety of applications, combined with an urgent need to minimize the quantity of waste for a balanced energy-from-waste strategy, has led to increasing scientific interest in developing new recycling processes for plastic products. Glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) is known to have some enhanced properties as compared to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) homopolymer; this has recently attracted the interest from the fused filament fabrication (FFF) three-dimensional (3D) printing community. PET has shown a reduced ability for repeated recycling through traditional processes. Herein, we demonstrate the potential for using recycled PETG in consecutive 3D printing manufacturing processes. Distributed recycling additive manufacturing (DRAM)-oriented equipment was chosen in order to test the mechanical and thermal response of PETG material in continuous recycling processes. Tensile, flexure, impact strength, and Vickers micro-hardness tests were carried out for six (6) cycles of recycling. Finally, Raman spectroscopy as well as thermal and morphological analyses via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractography were carried out. In general, the results revealed a minor knockdown effect on the mechanical properties as well as the thermal properties of PETG following the process proposed herein, even after six rounds of recycling.

AB Sustainability in additive manufacturing refers mainly to the recycling rate of polymers and composites used in fused filament fabrication (FFF), which nowadays are rapidly increasing in volume and value. Recycling of such materials is mostly a thermomechanical process that modifies their overall mechanical behavior. The present research work focuses on the acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) polymer, which is the second most popular material used in FFF-3D printing. In order to investigate the effect of the recycling courses on the mechanical response of the ABS polymer, an experimental simulation of the recycling process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters (i.e., contamination, ageing, etc.) has been performed. To quantify the effect of repeated recycling processes on the mechanic response of the ABS polymer, a wide variety of mechanical tests were conducted on FFF-printed specimens. Regarding this, standard tensile, compression, flexion, impact and micro-hardness tests were performed per recycle repetition. The findings prove that the mechanical response of the recycled ABS polymer is generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of repetitions. An optimum overall mechanical behavior is found between the third and the fifth repetition, indicating a significant positive impact of the ABS polymer recycling, besides the environmental one.

AB 3D printing technology is a versatile technology. The waste of 3D printed plastic products is a matter of concern because of its impact on the circular economy. In this paper, we discuss the current status and problems of 3D printing, different methods of 3D printing, and applications of 3D printing. This paper focuses on the recycling and degradation of different 3D printing materials. The degradation, although it can be done without pollution, has restrictions on the type of material and time. Degradation using ionic liquids can yield pure monomers but is only applicable to esters. The reprocessing recycling methods can re-utilize the excellent properties of 3D printed materials many times but are limited by the number of repetitions of 3D printed materials. Although each has its drawbacks, the great potential of the recycling of 3D printed waste plastics is successfully demonstrated with examples. Various recycling approaches provide the additional possibility of utilizing 3D printing waste to achieve more efficient circular application.

AB With the objective of giving a new economic life to postindustrial waste poly(lactic acid) (PLA), bio-composites based on recycled PLA were manufactured using conventional melt blending, and the strands produced were successfully used for three-dimensional (3D) printing of American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) samples by means of the fused deposition molding (FDM) method. This article further discusses the processing advantages and challenges associated with void formation, anisotropic behavior, and the quality of the 3D printed (3DP) samples in comparison with injection-molded (IM) counterparts. The blends were manufactured containing 30 wt % of recycled PLA in a matrix of virgin PLA. Similarly, blends were also prepared with addition of an epoxy-based chain extender (CE) and as well as with the CE and a reinforcing phase of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC). One of the limitations of recycled PLA in FDM-based 3D printing is its high melt flow due to the reduced molecular weight after recycling, which results in excessive material flow during extrusion, and hence limits its application in FDM-based 3D printing. Consequently, the main effect of the CE, Joncryl, was to control the Melt Flow Index (MFI) of the biocomposites containing the recycled PLA. The addition of CE also resulted in improvement of the impact strength of 3DP samples. In general, the CE in combination with the natural fibers (MCC) allowed the incorporation of postindustrial PLA. Data suggest that more recycled PLA may be incorporated by using this blend combination. In general, owing to the void formation, 3DP samples presented lower values of density (lightweight) and mechanical properties as compared with IM samples. However, the tensile strength, modulus and Izod impact strength of 3DP biocomposites were increased by up to 88%, 127%, and 11%, respectively, by the addition of 5 wt % MCC, as compared with 3DP samples based on postindustrial PLA without additives.

AB Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is the most common and widespread additive manufacturing (AM) technique, but it requires the formation of filament. Fused granular fabrication (FGF), where plastic granules are directly three-dimensional (3D) printed, has become a promising technique for the AM technology. FGF could be a key driver to promote further greening of distributed recycling thanks to the reduced melt solidification steps and elimination of the filament extruder system. However, only large-scale FGF systems have been tested for technical and economic viability of recycling plastic materials. The objective of this work is to evaluate the performance of the FFF and FGF techniques in terms of technical and economical dimensions at the desktop 3D printing scale. Recycled and virgin polylactic acid material was studied by using five different types of recycling feedstocks: commercial filament, pellets, distributed filament, distributed pellets, and shredded waste. The results showed that the mechanical properties from the FGF technique using same configurations showed no statistical differences to FFF samples. Nevertheless, the granulometry could have an influence on the reproducibility of the samples, which explains that the critical factor in this technology is to assure the material input in the feeding system. In addition, FGF costs per kg of material were reduced to less than 1 euro/kg compared with more than 20 euro/kg for commercial recycled filament. These results are encouraging to foster FGF printer diffusion among heavy users of 3D printers because of reducing the cost associated to the filament fabrication while ensuring the technical quality. This indicates the possibility of a new type of 3D printing recycled plastic waste that is more likely to drive a circular economy and distributed recycling.

AB A type of polyurethane with high mechanical performance, excellent recycling ability and shape memory property based on Diels-Alder (DA) reactions has been fabricated through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Firstly, polyurethane acrylate with DA-adduct is synthesized, and then compounded with reactive diluent and photoinitiators to get a series of photopolymer resins. Benefiting from the high curing rate and good fluidity, one type of photopolymer is applied in DLP 3D printing. The excellent mechanical and recycling properties of the cured polymers are proved through tensile tests. The printed samples exhibit remarkable shape memory performance with the shape fixity and recovery ratios of 96.4 +/- 0.1% and 99.3 +/- 0.3%, respectively and high shape recovery stress of 10.1 MPa, which is very high for shape memory polymers.

AB Recyclable electronics are important in green manufacturing and sustainable development, but in infancy, printing strategies still need more exploration and improvement. Metal drop-on-demand (DOD) printing is an ideal candidate for fabricating recyclable circuits, owing to its advantage of inherent direct recyclable feedstocks. Liquid metals with melting points at room temperature have been utilized to print circuits. However, developing liquid metal-based composites or encapsulation is still needed to maintain shapes of printed patterns and improve the adhesion between liquid metals and substrates, restricting the directly recycling of printed circuits. Herein, tin solder is utilized to directly print recyclable circuits via metal drop-on-demand printing method. The molten tin solder droplets directly melt plastic substrates and partially embed the substrate to obtain good adhesion. Molten droplets solidify timely to maintain the shapes of printed 2D conductive patterns and 3D microstructures without encapsulation. Moreover, the electrical conductivity of printed lines is close to the homogeneous bulk metal due to the direct metallurgical bonding between droplets. The conductive traces can be directly recycled by mechanically peeling from the substrate and remelting in the crucible. To validate this concept, a 555 circuit is successfully printed and recycled to fabricate a new 3D cross circuit. This work opens a new direction to directly fabricate recyclable circuits by using metal drop-on-demand printing.

AB This study explores the potential to reach a circular economy for post-consumer Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) packaging and bottles by using it as a Distributed Recycling for Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) feedstock. Specifically, for the first time, rPET water bottle flake is processed using only an open source toolchain with Fused Particle Fabrication (FPF) or Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) processing rather than first converting it to filament. In this study, first the impact of granulation, sifting, and heating (and their sequential combination) is quantified on the shape and size distribution of the rPET flakes. Then 3D printing tests were performed on the rPET flake with two different feed systems: an external feeder and feed tube augmented with a motorized auger screw, and an extruder-mounted hopper that enables direct 3D printing. Two Gigabot X machines were used, each with the different feed systems, and one without and the latter with extended part cooling. 3D print settings were optimized based on thermal characterization, and both systems were shown to 3D print rPET directly from shredded water bottles. Mechanical testing showed the importance of isolating rPET from moisture and that geometry was important for uniform extrusion. The mechanical strength of 3D-printed parts with FPF and inconsistent flow is lower than optimized fused filament, but adequate for a wide range of applications. Future work is needed to improve consistency and enable water bottles to be used as a widespread DRAM feedstock.

AB Petroleum-based polymer materials heavily rely on nonrenewable petrochemical resources, and damping materials are an important category of them. As far as green chemistry, recycling, and damping materials are concerned, there is an urgent need for renewable and recyclable biobased materials with high damping performance. Thus, this study designs and synthesizes a series of polylactic acid-based thermoplastic polyurethanes (PLA-based TPUs) composed of modified polylactic acid polyols, 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate, and 1,4-butanediol. PLA-based TPUs, as prepared, display excellent mechanical properties, damping performance, and biocompatibility. Otherwise, they can be used for three-dimensional printing (3D printing). Under multiple recycling, the overall performance of PLA-based TPUs is still maintained well. Overall, PLA-based TPUs, as designed in this article, show a potential application in damping materials under room temperature and personalized shoes via 3D printing and could realize resource recycling and material reuse.

AB Natural filler-based composites are an environmentally friendly and potentially sustainable alternative to synthetic or plastic counterparts. Recycling polymers and using agro-industrial wastes are measures that help to achieve a circular economy. Thus, this work presents the development and characterization of a 3D printing filament based on recycled polypropylene and cocoa bean shells, which has not been explored yet. The obtained composites were thermally and physically characterized. In addition, the warping effect, mechanical, and morphological analyses were performed on 3D printed specimens. Thermal analysis exhibited decreased thermal stability when cacao bean shell (CBS) particles were added due to their lignocellulosic content. A reduction in both melting enthalpy and crystallinity percentage was identified. This is caused by the increase in the amorphous structures present in the hemicellulose and lignin of the CBS. Mechanical tests showed high dependence of the mechanical properties on the 3D printing raster angle. Tensile strength increased when a raster angle of 0 degrees was used, compared to specimens printed at 90 degrees, due to the load direction. Tensile strength and fracture strain were improved with CBS addition in specimens printed at 90 degrees, and better bonding between adjacent layers was achieved. Electron microscope images identified particle fracture, filler-matrix debonding, and matrix breakage as the central failure mechanisms. These failure mechanisms are attributed to the poor interfacial bonding between the CBS particles and the matrix, which reduced the tensile properties of specimens printed at 0 degrees. On the other hand, the printing process showed that cocoa bean shell particles reduced by 67% the characteristic warping effect of recycled polypropylene during 3D printing, which is advantageous for 3D printing applications of the rPP. Thereby, potential sustainable natural filler composite filaments for 3D printing applications with low density and low cost can be developed, adding value to agro-industrial and plastic wastes.

AB Nowadays, the low recycling rate of polymers is still a challenge to humankind due to energy, economic and logistical issues. In the context of additive manufacturing, there is an exponential use of thermoplastic materials in the industrial and public open-source additive manufacturing sector, leading to an increase in global polymer consumption and waste generation. However, the coupling of the open-source 3D printers with polymer processing could potentially offer the basis for a new paradigm of distributed recycling process. It could be a complementary alternative to the traditional paradigm of centralized recycling of polymers, which is often uneconomical and energy intensive due to transportation embodied energy. In order to achieve this goal, a first step is to prove the technical feasibility to recycle thermoplastic material intended for open-source 3D printing feedstock.
   The contribution of the present study is twofold: first, a general methodology to evaluate the recyclability of thermoplastics used as feedstock in open-source 3D printing machines is proposed. Then, the proposed methodology is applied to the recycling study of polylactic acid (PLA) material addressed to the fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique, which is currently the most widely used. The main results of this application contribute to the understanding of the influence of the material's physico-chemical degradation on its mechanical properties as well as its potential distributed recyclability.

AB The current research was focused on a further insight into the mechanical properties of 3D parts printed with virgin and recycled polylactic acid (PLA). A first set of specimens was printed with virgin PLA filament and mechanically tested. Such specimens were then ground up and reextruded into filament using a homemade extruder. The re-extruded filament was employed to manufacture a new set of specimens which were also analysed. Three recycling processes were performed to assess the effect on the mechanical properties. The obtained results suggested that 3D printing with recycled PLA may be a viable option. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Concrete 3D printing is an application of 3D printing technology for the construction of concrete structural and non-structural elements. It is a rapid method of construction without the use of formwork, with minimum labor involvement and reduced material wastage. Curved walls and complex structures can be constructed by modifying the print path and controlling the rheological properties of concrete. The fusion of this technology with waste materials is necessary to reduce the problems associated with the recycling of wastes and to minimize CO2 emissions associated with the production of cement. In this study, two different municipal solid waste (MSW) incineration ashes (fly ash and bottom ash) were used to develop a concrete having rheological and hardened requirements of concrete used in 3D printing. Waste incinerator ashes were added as a substitute of ordinary Portland cement in concrete mix proportions. Flow table test and Gilmore needle test were used to measure the flow and setting time of concrete, respectively. Yield stress was measured by shear vane test. The buildability of ash containing printable concrete was simulated by comparing the vertical stresses due to the printing of concrete layers with the increase in the strength of the first stacked layer. Workability, open time, and buildability of the mix proportions were related to yield stress. The effect of adding waste incinerator ash upon the compressive strength was measured. The bond strength between layers at different printing time gaps was evaluated using bi-surface direct shear test. Experimental results showed that setting time promoting effect and initial yield stress enhancement by incinerated fly ash allows for a rapid construction speed with concrete 3D printing. This study concludes that incinerated fly ash can be successfully recycled in 3D printable concrete due to its favorable effects on rheology which are favorable for printing concrete.

AB With the 26% annual growth rate of additive manufacturing, especially in the area of 3D polymer printing, the amount of waste is increasing at a rapid rate. Limited research in the area of recycling has been produced, yet there are several recycling machines being developed for home use. Despite this work there is no published mechanical data on components produced with filament recycled from 3D printed parts. There is very limited data on mechanical properties of any 3D printed materials. This article compares the properties of parts 3D printed with virgin polylactic acid (PLA) to those printed with recycled PLA. Using commercially available PLA and an entry level 3D printer, tensile and shear specimens were produced and then tested for tensile yield strength, modulus of elasticity, shear yield strength, and hardness. The specimens were then ground up and re-extruded into filament, and a second set of specimens were produced and tested using this recycled PLA filament. Mechanical testing showed that 3D printing with recycled PLA is a viable option. With the recycled filament, tensile strength decreased 10.9%, shear strength increased 6.8%, and hardness decreased 2.4%. The tensile modulus of elasticity was statistically unchanged. Although the average mechanical properties before and after recycling were similar, there was more variability in the results of the recycled filament. Additionally, when printing with the recycled filament there was some nozzle clogging, while none occurred with the virgin filament. Overall, the mechanical properties of specimens 3D printed from recycled PLA filament were similar to virgin properties, encouraging further development in the area of recycling 3D printed filament.

   The circular economy model offers great opportunities to companies, as it not only allows them to capture additional value from their products and materials, but also reduce the fluctuations of price-related risks and material supply. These risks are present in all kind of businesses not based on the circular economy. The circular economy also enables economic growth without the need for more resources. This is because each unit has a higher value as a result of recycling and reuse of products and materials after use. Following this circular economics framework, the Polytechnic University of Madrid (Universidad Politecnica de Madrid, UPM) has adopted strategies aimed at improving the circularity of products. In particular, this article provides the result of obtaining recycled PLA filament from waste originating from university 3D FFF (fused filament fabrication) printers and waste generated by "Coronamakers" in the production of visors and parts for PPEs (Personal Protective Equipment) during the lockdown period of COVID-19 in Spain. This filament is used in the production of 3D printed parts that university students use in their classes, so the circular loop is closed. The obtained score of Material Circularity Indicator (MCI) of this material has been calculated, indicating its high level of circularity.

AB Biomass-derived poly(ethylene-2,5-furandicarboxylate) (PEF) has been used for fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printing. A complete cycle from cellulose to the printed object has been performed. The printed PEF objects created in the present study show higher chemical resistance than objects printed with commonly available materials (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PETG)). The studied PEF polymer has shown key advantages for 3D printing: optimal adhesion, thermoplasticity, lack of delamination and low heat shrinkage. The high thermal stability of PEF and relatively low temperature that is necessary for extrusion are optimal for recycling printed objects and minimizing waste. Several successive cycles of 3D printing and recycling were successfully shown. The suggested approach for extending additive manufacturing to carbon-neutral materials opens a new direction in the field of sustainable development.

AB Selective laser sintering (SLS) 3d printing was utilized to manufacture a solid catalyst for Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling reactions from polypropylene as a base material and palladium nanoparticles on silica (SilicaCat Pd(0)R815-100 by SiliCycle) as the catalytically active additive. The 3d printed catalyst showed similar activity to that of the pristine powdery commercial catalyst, but with improved practical recoverability and reduced leaching of palladium into solution. Recycling of the printed catalyst led to increase of the induction period of the reactions, attributed to the pseudo-homogeneous catalysis. The reaction is initiated by oxidative addition of aryl iodide to palladium nanoparticles, resulting in formation of soluble molecular species, which then act as the homogeneous catalyst. SLS 3d printing improves handling, overall practicality and recyclability of the catalyst without altering the chemical behaviour of the active component.

AB The aim of this paper is to analyse the fatigue behaviour of an additively manufactured (AM) short glass fiber reinforced polymer. The material under investigation is a recycled mineral-filled polypropylene reinforced by means of short glass fibers. The specimens have been produced by using a Pellet-based Additive Manufacturing (PAM) system, which is basically a Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) process in which the feedstock consists of pellets. The three infill patterns most commonly used in 3D printing were selected to produce dog-bone shaped specimens oriented with their axes parallel to the platform (i.e. orthogonal to the build direction). The fatigue behaviour of recycled 3D printed specimens was then compared to the results obtained from specimens made of the same material produced by injection moulding (IM). The effect of the recycling was studied only for the IM specimens by testing both the virgin and recycled compound. Finally, preliminary analyses of the macroscopic damage mechanisms were done by observing the fracture paths after fatigue failure. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB This paper presents the design and development of the Cupcake 3D CNC printer, a special class of machines designed for the automated construction of physical objects using additive layer manufacturing technology. The printer system is great for fabricating parts and designs that are not available on the open market. It prints with Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), High-Density Polyethylene (HDPE) and Polylactic Acid (PLA) plastics. To print a design, the printer platform moves in the X-Y plane and the extruder along the Z-axis with precision stepper motors while the extruder continually places a small stream of melted ABS. The recycler's addition to the printing system provides a way to reduce cost and make the system more environmentally friendly. A rotating auger bit inside an enclosure barrel forces the particulate down the tube. An electric motor turns the auger which grabs the material to move it down the barrel. Prototype of this design and the 3D printer were fabricated and tested to determine proper functionality.
   The 3D printer and the recycling system are currently being used to: teach additive layer manufacturing and rapid prototyping to students enrolled in manufacturing courses; print prototypes for new, difficult to find or expensive parts for research/design projects; and recycle the scrap ABS from the Cupcake 3D printer to a 3 mm filament and reuse it for printing new parts and prototypes. Samples printed using the 3D printer, the advantages of the recycling system, the difficulties encountered during the design and development, and recommendations for future recycling system design are presented and discussed.

AB The utilization of thermosetting waste is a serious issue as it is not recycled commercially due to inherent molecular properties and high technology cost. This research details the study of the mechanical behavior and surface analysis with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope of three-dimensional printed parts of the waste thermosetting polymer, bakelite (BAK) as the reinforcement along with ceramic particles (SiC and Al2O3) in recycled thermoplastic acrylonitrile butadiene styrene matrix for sustainability. The process involves twin-screw extrusion for the preparation of filament, followed by 3D printing of functional prototypes on fused deposition modeling setup. The 3D printed parts prepared with fused deposition modeling were used for the testing of mechanical, thermal, and morphological properties. The results of the present study suggests that for commercial applications recycling of thermoplastic up to 10 wt% can be easily performed without a change in any hardware/ software configuration of the fused deposition modeling setup and the ceramic concentration in thermoplastic-thermosetting blends further led to better mechanical and surface properties.

AB This paper presents an optimised material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing method with feedstock produced from glass fibre reinforced polypropylene (GFRPP) composite waste and investigates the effect of glass fibre weight fraction (0%, 15%, 30%, 40%) on the printability and mechanical properties of filaments and printed specimens. GFRPP feedstock filaments were fabricated by optimising the filament extrusion process parameters. The highest ultimate tensile strength (112 MPa) was obtained in a filament with 40% fibre weight content. In addition, repeated recycling of filament was shown to reduce the fibre aspect ratio and enhance the filament quality. It was shown that the increase in glass fibre content from 0% to 40% improved the ultimate tensile strength of MEX 3D printed specimens from 14.7 MPa to 23.4 MPa as well as the flexural strength of MEX 3D printed samples from 11.68 MPa to 66.55 MPa. The increase in fibre weight content from 30% to 40% had a minimal effect (+1%) on the ultimate tensile strength of the printed samples. In addition, the 40% filaments exhibited a more brittle behaviour, rendering them less suitable for MEX 3D printing than 30% GFRPP. The results showed that waste industrial GFRPP material can be effectively enhanced and converted to short fibre reinforced material extrusion filament feedstock for the printing of components as a circular economy demonstrator.

AB The extensive utilization of materials in daily life can result in environmental pollution, resource depletion, and numerous other consequences. One approach to mitigate these issues could be adopting recycling techniques for high-consumption materials. In this investigation, Acrylic Styrene Acrylonitrile (ASA) was selected for examination under six successive recycling cycles to assess its performance and suitability for material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing. This material was used for filament fabrication and three-dimensional (3D) specimen printing. Thermomechanical processes are expected to influence the behavior of the ASA samples. Furthermore, mechanical, thermal, and rheological tests were conducted, and the morphology and structure of the parts were investigated. The mechanical properties of the filaments were also assessed. Morphological and structural analyses were performed by micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The second recycling cycle samples were notable for their performance relative to the first cycle (20% higher tensile strength), whereas all five cycles demonstrated higher strength than the first cycle. These results indicate the promising potential of using recycled ASA in applications for various purposes.

AB One of the attitudes to recycling plastic in architectural design is it re-printing. 3D Printing of recycled polyethylene tereftalate is in its birth-days. Recycled filament can be bought in Argentina or Netherlands but lack of experience with this reborn material blocks its use in the Czech Republic. Firstly we made a study of settings of the home-3D-printers for this material. Secondly we came with a crowd printing project, which tested the possibility to print structural pieces by on various low-cost printers.

AB The 3D printing, now a day is a used resource that is increasing commercially. An important part of 3D printing is to provide printable material to the printer each time when needed, which is basically done with the inclusion of plastic filament reels of which the most common is the PLA, however, this is a final product that is marketed separately. In that situation arises the alternative to be able to recycle and reuse plastic material through disposable bottles that are normally discarded so that they can be used as printable material. In this sense, the present work shows the design of a 3D printer with equipment to supply the filament of different kinds of plastics for the printing. The objective of this project is to be able to integrate the supplying system of plastic material to the printer by supplying recycled plastic bottles that go through a whole process, and thus make the printer work with the supply as a single unit. This project is pretended to raise awareness in the recycling of materials such as plastic to avoid pollution, and by this, the famous three ecological R's that is Reduce, Reuse and Recycle can be put into practice.

AB This review investigates the pivotal challenge of recycling material waste in the context of additive manufacturing. We place an emphasis on decentralized 3D printing, shedding light on its environmental and economic implications. As additive manufacturing experiences exponential growth, the environment impact of waste generation during 3D printing processes has become increasingly significant. This paper explores various recycled materials commonly used in 3D printing, including polymers like polylactic acid (PLA), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), evaluating their characteristics and usability. General recycling methodologies, encompassing mechanical and chemical processes, are examined, with attention paid to challenges such as polymer sorting, additives, coatings, contamination, and thermoset reprocessing. The economic, societal, and environmental impacts of integrating recycled materials into 3D printing are examined. By identifying research gaps and proposing future trends, this review contributes to the development of a deeper understanding of how recycling can play a pivotal role in achieving environmental sustainability and economic viability within the decentralized 3D printing landscape.

AB Additive manufacturing presents promising potential as a sustainable processing technology, notably through integrating post-consumer recycled polymers into production. This study investigated the recycling of high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) into 3D printing filament, achieved by the following optimal extrusion parameters: 180 degrees C temperature, 7 rpm speed, and 10% glass powder addition. The properties of the developed rHDPE filament were compared with those of commonly used FDM filaments such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA) to benchmark the performance of rHDPE against well-established materials in the 3D printing industry, providing a practical perspective for potential users. The resulting filament boasted an average tensile strength of 25.52 MPa, slightly exceeding ABS (25.41 MPa) and comparable to PLA (28.55 MPa). Despite diameter fluctuations, the filament proved usable in 3D printing. Mechanical tests compared the rHPDE filament 3D printed objects with ABS and PLA, showing lower strength but exceptional ductility and flexibility, along with superior sound absorption. A life cycle analysis underscored the sustainability advantages of rHDPE, reducing environmental impact compared to conventional disposal methods. While rHDPE falls behind in mechanical strength against virgin filaments, its unique attributes and sustainability position it as a valuable option for 3D printing, showcasing recycled materials' potential in sustainable innovation.

AB Although the production of polymer/carbon nanotube (CNT) nanocomposites has grown exponentially over the last years for a variety of applications, the availability of polymer/CNT filaments for use in commercial 3D printing systems is very limited, and, currently, little is known about the printability of recycled polymer/CNT nanocomposites. In this respect, the fused filament fabrication (FFF) of recycled thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/CNT nanocomposites was investigated with a special focus on the piezoresistive behavior. Mechanically recycled and virgin TPU/CNT nanocomposites with different CNT contents (0.5, 1, 3, and 5 wt% by weight) were subjected to filament extrusion and FFF, and the changes induced by mechanical recycling, CNT contents, and infill orientation were monitored by melt flow index, thermal, mechanical, electrical, and piezoresistive properties. It was found that the recycled TPU nanocomposites exhibit very good printability with mechanical and electrical properties that are generally comparable with those for the virgin nanocomposites, the decrease of the elongation at break at 5 wt% CNTs being the primary challenge for the mechanical recycling of TPU/CNT nanocomposites. The 3D-printed recycled TPU/CNT nanocomposites with 3 wt% and 5 wt% CNTs have very good strain sensing behavior with tunable sensitivity by varying the printing conditions. When targeting strains that suit the human motion (0-68%), the recycled TPU/CNT film sensors printed with 0-infill orientation show higher sensitivity (gauge factor up to 115 and 20 for 3 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively) compared with the virgin TPU/CNT film sensors (gauge factor up to 50 and 15 for 3 wt% and 5 wt%, respectively). The findings of this work provide guidance for assessing the potential of using recycled TPU/CNT nanocomposites for 3D printing strain sensors for a wide range of human motions.

TI Subtle differences in recycled polypropylene from rheology to additives

AB The decentralized production associated with material extrusion additive manufacture (MEX) has been proposed as an ideal path to increase the circularity of plastics through direct recycling. Although multiple studies have reported on the 3D printing of various recycled plastics, variability in recycled materials, in particular postconsumer waste, challenges the direct extension of these results into production through MEX. Here, we demonstrate filament fabrication and printing of post-consumer polypropylene (PP), where the PP is sourced from clear, cold drink cups from three large international food service and beverage retail chains to provide well defined plastic waste that is perfectly sorted for recycling. These sources for the recycled PP were selected due to their ready availability to enable the results to be directly applied for hobbyist printing, blow molded products to provide good mechanical performance, and the clarity of the PP that suggests formulation design to minimize the PP crystal size. Despite the similarities in the end use product and their physical appearance, the source for the PP impacted the mechanical properties and the visual appearance of the printed objects. These differences can be directly traced to the rheological properties and oxidative stability of the PP at conditions relevant with the print process. These results clearly illustrate differences in initial formulation design and branding details, even when the product is for the same application, impacts the performance of recycled plastics in AM. The high viscosity associated with the PP from blow molding leads to requirements for higher extrusion temperatures for printing. The combination of high temperature and shear during extrusion process of 3D printing degrades the recycled PP. For circularity with MEX with recycled PP, one needs to consider the evolution in the properties of the polymer. Rheological details of recycled plastics are critical to selection of processing conditions and performance of MEX parts. Reporting of rheological data of recycled plastics and these properties after printing is critical to enable translation towards circular 3D printing of recycled plastics.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is considered one of the leading technologies in the latest industrial revolution, enabling the integration of smart production and information systems. In particular, vat photopolymerization has emerged as a fast growing AM technology creating products in high resolution and speed. Vat photopolymerization predominantly fabricates permanently cross-linked network polymers which complicates efficient recycling of products after use. Recently, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) entered into the realm of AM, offering a promising route to prevent the accumulation of printed plastics as waste material. Due to the self-healing and recycling capabilities facilitated by their dynamic covalent bonds, CANs permit the repair and reprocessing of fractured parts, and the design of recycled inks for cyclic 3D printing. These advances will promote the role of AM in the transition toward a circular plastics economy.

AB Plastic materials have been widely used to replace metals in functional parts due to their lower cost and comparable technical properties. However, the increasing use of virgin plastic material in consumer and industrial applications has placed a significant burden on waste management due to the volume of waste created and the potential negative effects of its end-of-life processing. There is a need to adopt circular economy strategies such as plastic recycling within industrial applications in order to reduce this significant waste management pressure. The present study used recycled polylactic acid (PLA) material as a feedstock for the 3D printing of a centrifugal semi-open pump impeller. The technical performance of 3D printed recycled PLA material and virgin PLA material was compared in this study. The environmental impacts for technically feasible impellers were assessed through the environmental life cycle assessment, while costs were evaluated by life cycle costing. The results were incorporated into a techno-eco-efficiency framework to compare the technical properties, environmental impacts, and costs. The social impacts of additive manufacturing and recycled feedstock material were also explored. The technical assessment results indicated that tensile strength, fatigue strength, density, and hardness decreased with recycled material content compared to virgin material. Microscopy of the fracture surfaces revealed the presence of slightly higher porosity and defects in recycled specimens, which could result in slightly lower technical properties. However, the recycled material was accepted for further ecological analysis as it offered higher pumping performance when compared to the original component and could reduce the burden on virgin material-based production and waste material disposal. Importantly, the results showed that 3D printed recycled PLA impellers are more eco-efficient when compared to 3D printed virgin PLA impellers.

AB The production of plastic has grown exponentially over the past few decades and with it the amount of plastic waste leaking in the environment, where it fragments into micro-and nanoplastics. This problematic situation stresses the need for increased plastic collection, recycling and reuse rates. Extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) and especially fused filament fabrication (FFF) offer an efficient and effective method to reuse and upcycle recycled plastic. This study focuses on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), which has a broad application window and its recycling is therefore environmentally and economically favorable and sustainable. Therefore, this study involves the thermal and mechanical behavior of recycled PET after extrusion and 3D printing. The extrusion parameters are optimized by performing a complete physico-chemical and thermal analysis of the obtained filaments and they were compared with commercial virgin and recycled PET. Moreover, the influence of the applied processing conditions on the degree of crystallinity and mechanical properties is investigated. The filaments are then used for FFF, where various printing parameters are altered to obtain the optimum printing conditions (i.e. printing temperature, the build plate temperature, fan cooling and printing directions). The effect of the degree of crystallinity of semi-crystalline PET is investigated via altered printing parameters, showing superior mechanical properties for an increasing degree of crystallinity. To verify the portability of the obtained optimized print parameters, two different FFF printers are used. The use of recycled PET as feedstock for FFF supports the efforts for improving the sustainability of plastics by valorizing PET waste, and prolonging the lifecycle of PET.

AB The aim of this study was to compare the quality of printed samples that were printed using additive technology from commercial and recycled PLA (polylactic acid) filament that the authors of this study produced themselves. Furthermore this scientific work deals with the optimization of parameters during the extrusion of filaments based on polymers, which are on a commercial basis, where we also used the process of recycling and re-extrusion. Subsequently, additive printing and non-destructive testing of the samples were started. These tests are intended to determine the future application of the given materials and compare the resulting parameters of recycled and non-recycled filament used in 3D printing of samples. Microscopic analysis with the help of a Metrotome 1500 and microscope from Carl Zeiss brings us detailed results from the composition of materials and possible defects during 3D printing.

DE recycled polymer; 3D printing; filament production
AB One of the primary issues with waste management and environmental preservation in recent years has been the recycling of plastic. Polymer materials are used in many aspects of daily life and business. In addition to their extended use, plastic waste became a problem since it was a persistent and dangerous after discarding. Reusing polymeric materials maximises waste utilisation to create consumable items and creates a path of valorisation, or a second life. The 3D printing sector is rapidly growing. A variety of thermoplastic materials, including recycled ones, can be used to make printable filaments. The article detailed a new application for material recovered from the recycling of acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS): filaments that may be used in 3D printing were made by combining material gathered from 3D printing waste with machine filament waste. Using a universal testometer, samples of recycled ABS (rABS) and virgin ABS (vABS) from printing waste were mixed at seven distinct concentrations. The recycled polymer ABS was mixed with varying concentrations of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO nano), and the impact of these particles on the mechanical characteristics of the polymer was investigated. After mixing the recycle polymer with nano filler ZnO at 3% concentration, fatigue tests were conducted on it.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) has been proposed as a route to improve circularity in plastics through local recycling by consumers of their plastic waste into filaments for 3D printing. Polypropylene (PP) would be a promising feedstock in this scenario as PP is one of the largest plastic waste streams and historically has a low recycling rate. However, PP is challenging to accurately print into useable objects due to crystallization-induced warping and delamination during printing. Here, the objective is to overcome these challenges to enable the printability of recycled PP with transferable approaches to the 3D printing user community for sustainable filaments. We demonstrate a simple approach that is translatable to virgin and recycled PP through the inclusion of a natural rod-like clay, sepiolite, and maleated PP compatibilizer to improve the printability of PP through material extrusion AM. Inclusion of 10 wt % sepiolite leads to improvements to the printability, dimensional accuracy, and strength of the printed parts for both virgin and recycled PP resins. Higher filler loading can lead to backflow in the hot end from high viscosity of the nanocomposite. Lower filler content reduces warping and distortions from crystallization of PP relative to the neat PP, but the dimensional accuracy generally improves with increasing sepiolite loading. The broad compositional range for sepiolite to enhance printability provides an opportunity for admixes for recycling PP into filaments through concentrated master batching of sepiolite with PP for consumers wishing to upcycle their PP waste through 3D printing.

AB Polymers filled with natural-based fillers have shown growing demand/interest in recent years, including in additive manufacturing. Like most natural fillers in 3D printing, wood particles serve mainly as a filler that lowers the cost of the printing material due to their low price. However, could wood be used as a main ingredient to affect/improve the properties of 3D-printed parts? Several advantages, such as its reinforcing ability, biodegradability, availability as waste material from other industries, ability to be used in different forms or only in partial components, recycling options or even the use of its undesirable hydromorph-induced dimensional instability for 4D printing, indicate the importance of exploring its use in 3D printing. A review of publications on 3D printing with wood biomass and technologies involving the use of wood particles and components was conducted to identify the possibilities of using wood in additive technologies and their potential.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is energizing the fields of chemistry and materials science to develop new inks for new applications within fields such as aerospace, robotics, and healthcare. AM enables the fabrication of innumerable 3D geometries that cannot be easily produced by other means. In spite of the great promise of AM as an advanced form of future manufacturing, there are still fundamental challenges with respect to sustainability that need to be addressed. Some of the material needs for AM include sustainable sources of printing inks, resins, and filaments, as well as pathways for polymer recycling, upcycling, and chemical circularity. Furthermore, the combination of biosourced and biodegradable polymers with additive manufacturing could enable the fabrication of objects that can be recycled back into feedstock or degraded into nontoxic products after they have served their function. Herein, we review the recent literature on the design and chemistry of the polymers that enable sustainability within the field of AM, with a particular focus on biodegradable and biosourced polymers. We also discuss some of the sustainability-related applications that have emerged as a result of AM technologies.

AB Covalent adaptable network (CAN) polymers doped with conductive nanoparticles are an ideal candidate to create reshapeable, rehealable, and fully recyclable electronics. On the other hand, 3D printing as a deterministic manufacturing method has a significant potential to fabricate electronics with low cost and high design freedom. In this paper, we incorporate a conductive composite consisting of polyimine CAN and multi-wall carbon nanotubes into direct-ink-writing 3D printing to create polymeric sensors with outstanding reshaping, repairing, and recycling capabilities. The developed printable ink exhibits good printability, conductivity, and recyclability. The conductivity of printed polyimine composites is investigated at different temperatures and deformation strain levels. Their shape-reforming and Joule heating-induced interfacial welding effects are demonstrated and characterized. Finally, a temperature sensor is 3D printed with defined patterns of conductive pathways, which can be easily mounted onto 3D surfaces, repaired after damage, and recycled using solvents. The sensing capability of printed sensors is maintained after the repairing and recycling. Overall, the 3D printed reshapeable, rehealable, and recyclable sensors possess complex geometry and extend service life, which assist in the development of polymer-based electronics toward broad and sustainable applications.

AB There is a large amount of carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) waste generated annually, mainly due to the difficulty in recycling CFRPs. This work presents a novel additive manufacturing-based recycling approach that can be used to reclaim CFRP waste and to re-manufacture the carbon fiber into 3D printed composite parts. A trial of this idea was set up, in which carbon fiber was first reclaimed from CFRP waste using supercritical fluid and then mixed with Poly-Ether-Ether-Ketone to produce composite filaments. The filaments were then fed into a printer of fused deposition modeling (i.e., a 3D printing process) and the recycled CFRP parts were fabricated. The engineering application-oriented tests demonstrate that the reclaimed carbon fiber can modify the performances of 3D printed part effectively in terms of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, heat conduction and wear resistance. This work illustrates that the additive manufacturing-based recycling approach offers a possible strategy to recycle CFRP waste and fabricate high-performance engineering parts with complex geometries, which are economical and environmentally friendly.

AB As the additive manufacturing industry grows, it is compounding the global plastic waste problem. Distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) offers an economic solution to this challenge, but it has been relegated to either small-volume 3D printers (limiting waste recycling throughput) or expensive industrial machines (limiting accessibility and lateral scaling). To overcome these challenges, this paper provides proof-of-concept for a novel, open-source hybrid 3D printer that combines a low-cost hanging printer design with a compression-screw-based end-effector that allows for the direct extrusion of recycled plastic waste in large expandable printing volumes. Mechanical testing of the resultant prints from 100% waste plastic, however, showed that combining the challenges of non-uniform feedstocks and a heavy printhead for a hangprinter reduced the strength of the parts compared to fused filament fabrication. The preliminary results are technologically promising, however, and provide opportunities to improve on the open-source design to help process the volumes of waste plastic needed for DRAM to address the negative environmental impacts of global plastic use.

AB Vitrimers have shown advantages over conventional thermosets via capabilities of dynamic network rearrangement to endow repairability as well as recyclability. Based on such characteristics, vitrimers have been studied and have shown promises as a 3D printing ink material that can be recycled with the purpose of waste reduction. However, despite the brilliant approaches, there still remain limitations regarding requirement of new reagents for recycling the materials or reprintability issues. Here, a new class of a 4D printable vitrimer that is translated from a commercial poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) resin is reported to exhibit self-healability, weldability, reprocessability, as well as reprintability. Thus, formed 3D-printed vitrimer products show superior heat resistance in comparison to commercial PCL prints, and can be repeatedly reprocessed or reprinted via filament extrusion and a handheld fused deposition modeling (FDM)-based 3D printing method. Furthermore, incorporation of semicrystalline PCL renders capabilities of shape memory for 4D printing applications, and as far as it is known, such demonstration of FDM 3D-printed shape memory vitrimers has not been realized yet. It is envisioned that this work can fuel advancement in 4D printing industries by suggesting a new material candidate with all rounded capabilities with minimized environmental challenges.

AB The 3D printability of several thermoplastic feedstocks, recycled from post-industrial or post-consumer waste and the properties of printed items are presented and discussed. A preliminary investigation has been conducted with post-industrial scraps of PETG and PLA recycled into printable filaments. A comparison with samples produced with corresponding virgin materials showed similar mechanical characteristics. The printability of virgin, recycled and recycled/UVA exposed ABS pellets from extruded scraps is also compared. Recycled pellets were aged by exposure to UVA light up to 400 hours. The results of mechanical tests of 3D printed specimens indicate that the printability of recycled and artificially aged ABS pellets is still acceptable. Furthermore, nylon fibres recycled from clothing were used as feedstock for 3D printing. A simple and inexpensive recycling process is proposed to recover extruded pellets from nylon t-shirts. On the other hand, 3D printing tests showed that the recycled nylon has some prospects for 3D printing, but only if mixed at low percentage with virgin polymer.

AB Natural and synthetic rubber is gaining increased interest in various industrial applications and daily life sectors (automotive industry, acoustic and electrical isolators, adhesives, impermeable surfaces, and others) due to its remarkable physicomechanical properties, excellent durability, and abrasive resistance. These great characteristics are accompanied by some recycling difficulties of the final products, particularly originated from the tire waste rubber industry. In this study, recycled tire rubber was incorporated in polymer matrices using selective laser sintering as 3D printing technology. Two polymers were used-polyamide and thermoplastic polyurethane, for their rigid and elastomeric properties, respectively. Polymer composites containing various tire powder amounts, up to 40 wt.%, were prepared by physical blending. The final materials' morphological characteristics, mechanical properties, and thermal stability were evaluated. The proposed ambitious additive manufacturing approach looked over also some of the major aspects to be considered during the 3D printing procedure. In addition, examples of printed prototypes with potential applications were also proposed revealing the potential of the recycled tire rubber-loaded composites.

AB This study examines the changes in physical and mechanical properties of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) when manufactured using fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing across multiple recycling phases. Tests were carried out initially using virgin ABS, which subsequently underwent two successive closed-loop filament extrusion and 3D printing phases. For each endpoint manufacturing phase, samples were examined to monitor the changes in thermal characteristics, mechanical properties, and polymer degradation. It was found that there was a series of physical changes of the polymer, which resulted in reduced melt flow, increased glass transition temperature, and the generation of carbonyl groups, which may be attributed to the thermal oxidative breakdown of both styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and butadiene components of ABS. The recycled polymer also showed a reduction in both tensile and compressive strengths compared to the virgin material. However, compared to one-time recycled ABS, two-times recycled ABS showed increased strength, implying that increased recycle state of the polymer may be advantageous with respect to mechanical properties and potential manufacturing applications. This study ultimately demonstrates the potential to leverage additive manufacturing (AM) toward a closed-loop manufacturing paradigm by using waste ABS across several life cycles.

AB Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a process that deposits materials on a platform to form 3D objects layers by layers. One of the downsides of AM is wastage generated during the printing process. Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) is a popular material used in AM for thermoplastics. This study focused on the feasibility of using recycled ABS for the 3D printing process via an open source Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) printer. The recycling process began by re-granulating the ABS waste and turning it into a new filament that used to print the test specimens. The experiment was carried out on the mechanical properties of the test specimens, and a comparison was made with the standard ABS specimens. The results showed that recycled ABS could be converted into filaments with an extrusion temperature of 270 degrees C and a travel speed of conveyor at 18 mm/s. The results of mechanical properties showed recycled specimen had 32% and 28% reduction in flexural and tensile strength of the printed material, respectively, while an 82% increase in the compression strength due to multiple recycling cycles. With the aid of ultrasound vibration (20 kHz) onto the recycled ABS specimen, the results showed a 53% increase in flexural strength, 59% increase in compression strength and 19% increase in tensile strength comparing with 0 kHz of recycled ABS specimen. Overall, the recycled ABS waste is a viable option for better use of printed materials and, with the aid of ultrasound vibration, it helps to improve the mechanical properties of the recycled ABS.

AB The potential of three-dimensional (3D) printing technology in the fabrication of advanced polymer composites is becoming increasingly evident. This review discusses the latest research developments and applications of 3D printing in polymer composites. First, it focuses on the optimization of 3D printing technology, that is, by upgrading the equipment or components or adjusting the printing parameters, to make them more adaptable to the processing characteristics of polymer composites and to improve the comprehensive performance of the products. Second, it focuses on the 3D printable novel consumables for polymer composites, which mainly include the new printing filaments, printing inks, photosensitive resins, and printing powders, introducing the unique properties of the new consumables and different ways to apply them to 3D printing. Finally, the applications of 3D printing technology in the preparation of functional polymer composites (such as thermal conductivity, electromagnetic interference shielding, biomedicine, self-healing, and environmental responsiveness) are explored, with a focus on the distribution of the functional fillers and the influence of the topological shapes on the properties and functional characteristics of the 3D printed products. The aim of this review is to deepen the understanding of the convergence between 3D printing technology and polymer composites and to anticipate future trends and applications. image

AB Mishandling of waste plastics and biomasses is a major global concern. Every year, around 380 million tonnes of plastic are produced, with only 9% being recycled, leading to widespread pollution. Similarly, waste biomass generation from agricultural and forestry sectors accounts for 140 billion metric tonnes, in addition to 2.01 billion tonnes from municipal solid waste. This review paper addresses the gap regarding the integration of 3D printing, upcycling of recycled plastics, and the utilization of waste biomass in sustainable composites. 3D printed parts from recycled plastic have shown comparable mechanical properties compared to virgin materials, which have been further improved by the addition of waste biomass-derived fillers. The paper acknowledges that different printing parameters have substantial influence on the strength, ductility, crystallinity, and dimensional accuracy of printed parts. Therefore, optimizing these parameters becomes crucial for achieving improved mechanical performance. Moreover, incorporating reinforcing agents, stabilizers, chain extenders, compatibilizers, and surface modifiers in plastic recycling and 3D printing presents an excellent opportunity to enhance mechanical properties, thermal stability, adhesion, and dimensional stability. Additionally, the review identifies research gaps and proposes the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence for enhanced process control and material development, further expanding the possibilities in this field.

   COMPOSITES
AB Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing attracts growing attention as a promising method for creating functionally graded materials. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is widely available, but due to its simple process, creating spatial gradation of diverse properties using FDM is challenging. Here, we present a 3D printed digital material filament that is structured towards 3D printing of functional gradients, utilizing only a readily available FDM printer and filaments. The DM filament consists of multiple base materials combined with specific concentrations and distributions, which are FDM printed. When the DM filament is supplied to the same printer, its constituent materials are homogeneously blended during extrusion, resulting in the desired properties in the final structure. This enables spatial programming of material properties in extreme variations, including mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and color, which are otherwise impossible to achieve with traditional FDMs. Our approach can be readily adopted to any standard FDM printer, enabling low-cost production of functional gradients.
   3D printing of functional gradients often requires specialized equipment and costly materials, constraining scalability. Here, using a conventional desktop FDM printer, authors present a 3D printing strategy using a filament that is itself 3D-printed to produce functional gradients.

AB This study explores the integration of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) with recycled aggregate concrete (RAC) and plant fibres, highlighting its role in advancing sustainable construction practices. The findings demonstrate that plant fibres enhance the mechanical and thermal properties and environmental impact of normal concrete and RAC, including the improvements in compressive, flexural, fracture characteristics. Building on these substantial enhancements, the study further investigates the potential of combining 3DCP with plant fibre-reinforced RAC. Researches indicate that fibres can mitigate the negative performance impacts brought about by the use of RAC in 3D printing, particularly in terms of tensile and flexural resistance. Based on these findings, the introduction of plant fibres is expected to optimise the mechanical properties while also having a notable impact on carbon emissions. This synergy between 3DCP and plant fibre-reinforced RAC not only aligns with sustainable construction goals but also marks a significant shift towards environmentally responsible practices and innovations in the construction industry.

AB Since first introduced in the late 1960s, three-dimensional (3D) printing has gained great attention from academia and industry because of its potential hyper flexibility and precision nature in designing and manufacturing of any complex structural products. As a result of much effort, a number of 3D printing technologies have been developed so far, which can be categorized by seven major families depending upon the printing schemes and layering materials. In this article, the recent advances in the seven 3D printing families were critically reviewed from the views of pros and cons in the methodology nature, material availability, printed product size and quality, product properties performance, cost, and applicability. The global 3D printing market was also discussed, including 3D printer and layering material markets. In addition, perspectives were given for further advancing 3D printers in the repeatability and reproducibility, developing new layering materials with processability and property performances, building up and utilization of data bases on the process-morphology development-property relations, and reducing investment and production costs, which are necessary to expand global 3D printing market to all research and industrial fields.

AB Digital light processing (DLP) is a 3D printing technology offering high resolution and speed. Printable materials are commonly based on multifunctional monomers, resulting in the formation of thermosets that usually cannot be reprocessed or recycled. Some efforts are made in DLP 3D printing of thermoplastic materials. However, these materials exhibit limited and poor mechanical properties. Here, a new strategy is presented for DLP 3D printing of thermoplastics based on a sequential construction of two linear polymers with contrasting (stiff and flexible) mechanical properties. The inks consist of two vinyl monomers, which lead to the stiff linear polymer, and alpha-lipoic acid, which forms the flexible linear polymer via thermal ring-opening polymerization in a second step. By varying the ratio of stiff and flexible linear polymers, the mechanical properties can be tuned with Young's modulus ranging from 1.1 GPa to 0.7 MPa, while the strain at break increased from 4% to 574%. Furthermore, these printed thermoplastics allow for a variety of reprocessability pathways including self-healing, solvent casting, reprinting, and closed-loop recycling of the flexible polymer, contributing to the development of a sustainable materials economy. Last, the potential of the new material in applications ranging from soft robotics to electronics is demonstrated.
   Digital light 3D printing of thermoplastics with customizable mechanical properties and versatile reprocessability is realized by sequentially constructing stiff and flexible double linear polymers. The obtained 3D double thermoplastics exhibit tunable mechanical properties from rigid to flexible, as well as multiple reprocessability such as self-healing and reprinting, demonstrating potential applications in soft robotics and soft electronics. image

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), commonly referred to as 3D printing, has revolutionized the manufacturing landscape by enabling the intricate layer-by-layer construction of three-dimensional objects. In contrast to traditional methods relying on molds and tools, AM provides the flexibility to fabricate diverse components directly from digital models without the need for physical alterations to machinery. Four-dimensional printing is a revolutionary extension of 3D printing that introduces the dimension of time, enabling dynamic transformations in printed structures over predetermined periods. This comprehensive review focuses on polymeric materials in 3D printing, exploring their versatile processing capabilities, environmental adaptability, and applications across thermoplastics, thermosetting materials, elastomers, polymer composites, shape memory polymers (SMPs), including liquid crystal elastomer (LCE), and self-healing polymers for 4D printing. This review also examines recent advancements in microvascular and encapsulation self-healing mechanisms, explores the potential of supramolecular polymers, and highlights the latest progress in hybrid printing using polymer-metal and polymer-ceramic composites. Finally, this paper offers insights into potential challenges faced in the additive manufacturing of polymer composites and suggests avenues for future research in this dynamic and rapidly evolving field.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been profoundly changing the production mode of traditional industries. However, this technique is usually limited to metre-scale fabrication, which prevents large-scale 3D printing (LS3DP) applications such as the manufacturing of buildings, aircraft, ships, and rockets. LS3DP faces great challenges, particularly, it not only requires confronting problems not yet solved by conventional 3D printing, such as the inability to print functional structures due to limitations by single-material manufacturing, but also needs to overcome the size effect limitation of large-scale printing. Here, we systematically review the state of the art in the integration of materials and technologies in LS3DP. We also demonstrate some disruptive engineering cases of LS3DP in the field of construction. The challenges and strategies for overcoming size constraints to achieve LS3DP of functional structures are discussed, including multifunctional 3D printing processes from nano- to large-scale and large-scale 4D printing processes, diverse printable materials and sustainable structures, horizontal and vertical size-independent printers, collaborative and intelligent control of the entire process, and extreme environment printing. These strategies can provide tremendous opportunities for the fully automated, intelligent, and unmanned production of these different material megastructures and internal multiscale multifunctional components such as buildings/structures, aerospace vehicles, and marine equipment.

AB Filaments from blends of post-industrial, low -quality recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (RPET) and ethylenebutyl-acrylate-glycidyl-methacrylate (EBA-GMA) were extruded with different EBA-GMA contents, then specimens were 3D -printed by fused filament fabrication technology. It has been demonstrated that, when 0-90 degrees layer order is applied, at 15 wt% EBA-GMA content the unnotched impact strength increases by two and a half times and the notched impact strength by nine times compared to samples printed from elastomer-free RPET. DSC and DMA measurements proved that EBA-GMA reactively bonds to PET molecules, which is indicated by the increment of rigid amorphous phase and glass transition temperature and the reduction of crystallinity. The copolymer molecules formed in -situ during compounding create a Toughening Enhancer Interphase (TEI), which also remains after 3D printing and effectively enhances impact strength. The strain at break and tensile strength of the filaments are substantially higher than that of 3D -printed specimens due to the increasing shrinkage and the resulting increased porosity of the printed specimens with higher EBA-GMA content. However, the Youngmodulus values are quite similar. The flexural strength of the 3D -printed specimens reaches 40-60% of the values of injection moulded samples. The proposed method enables the production of parts with arbitrary geometry and balanced mechanical properties from RPET, which may substitute acrylonitrile butadiene styrene.

AB The development of renewable vinyl-based photopolymer resins offers a promising solution to reducing the environmental impact associated with 3D printed materials. This study introduces a bifunctional lipoate cross-linker containing a dynamic disulfide bond, which is combined with acrylic monomers (n-butyl acrylate) and conventional photoinitiators to develop photopolymer resins that are compatible with commercial stereolithography 3D printing. The incorporation of disulfide bonds within the polymer network's backbone imparts the 3D printed objects with self-healing capabilities and complete degradability. Remarkably, the degraded resin can be fully recycled and reused for high-resolution reprinting of complex structures while preserving mechanical properties that are comparable to the original material. This proof-of-concept study not only presents a sustainable strategy for advancing acrylate-based 3D printing materials, but also introduces a novel approach for fabricating fully recyclable 3D-printed structures. This method paves the way for reducing the environmental impact while enhancing material reusability, offering significant potential for the development of eco-friendly additive manufacturing.

However, the FDM process is complex and depends on multiple parameters, which makes it challenging to obtain high-quality and consistent 3D printed components. The purpose of this study is to simplify the printing process for users and potentially improve the overall quality and consistency of printed objects. This research delved into optimising 3D printing parameters, specifically raster orientation and in-fill speed, for PLA material through three experimental studies. The mean effect of these parameters and the effects of their interaction through analysis of variance (ANOVA) on tensile properties were also discussed. Initial experiments identified the most suitable parameters and its optimal values for PLA, which were then applied to five different materials: PETG, PLA tough, Recycle PLA, Plain PLA, and ABS. Tensile tests assessed the printed parts, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to analyze fracture interfaces and material failure causes. This study identified a raster of 45 degrees/-45 degrees and 30 mm/s infill speed as optimal for diverse 3D printing materials. Notably, ABS, PETG, and tough PLA exhibited better tensile strengths, surpassing manufacturer benchmarks. However, Plain PLA and Recycled PLA, despite lower tensile strengths, proved valuable for specific applications. Interestingly, all tested materials showed greater flexibility than manufacturer recommendations, suggesting their suitability in scenarios needing both strength and flexibility. This study's results offer promising avenues for refining 3D printing practices, to the advantage of all users. The findings from this study offer significant insights for future research to investigate the effect of other process parameters on the quality of 3D printed parts, leading to further advancements of AM.Highlights Optimised 3D printing parameters. Applicability of optimised settings extended across various materials. ABS, PETG, and tough PLA exceeded manufacturer benchmarks in tensile strength. Experimental and ANOVA findings are in good agreement, revealing significant process parameters.

AB Digital Light Processing (DLP) is a vat photopolymerization-based 3D printing technology that fabricates parts typically made of chemically crosslinked polymers. The rapidly growing DLP market has an increasing demand for polymer raw materials, along with growing environmental concerns. Therefore, circular DLP printing with a closed-loop recyclable ink is of great importance for sustainability. The low-ceiling temperature alkyl-substituted delta-valerolactone (VL) is an industrially accessible biorenewable feedstock for developing recyclable polymers. In this work, acrylate-functionalized poly(delta-valerolactone) (PVLA), synthesized through the ring-opening transesterification polymerization of VL, is used as a platform photoprecursor to improve the chemical circularity in DLP printing. A small portion of photocurable reactive diluent (RD) turns the unprintable PVLA into DLP printable ink. Various photocurable monomers can serve as RDs to modulate the properties of printed structures for applications like sacrificial molds, soft actuators, sensors, etc. The intrinsic depolymerizability of PVLA is well preserved, regardless of whether the printed polymer is a thermoplastic or thermoset. The recovery yield of virgin quality VL monomer is 93% through direct bulk thermolysis of the printed structures. This work proposes the utilization of depolymerizable photoprecursors and highlights the feasibility of biorenewable VL as a versatile material platform toward circular DLP printing.
   The low-ceiling temperature biobased alkyl-substituted delta-valerolactone is utilized to synthesize a depolymerizable photoprecursor through ring-opening polymerization. It can serve as a platform material to formulate different resins for vat photopolymerization-based 3D printing. The intrinsic recyclability of the low-ceiling feature of delta-valerolactone enables the "monomer-polymer-monomer" closed-loop recycling that enhances the chemical circularity in 3D printing. image

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) involves creating prototypes by depositing and solidifying material by the placement of material in X, Y, and Z axes in a 3D space. The emergence of AM using elastomers has allowed the production of complex and customised parts with intricate geometries and modified properties as per specific needs of engineers cum designers. For successful 3D printing (3DP), it is crucial to use a material that is suitable for the specific application and printing process. Elastomers are unique polymers that are resilient, flexible and capable of deforming under stress. Fused deposition modelling, stereolithography and selective laser sintering printing are the most common 3DP techniques for elastomers. The use of elastomers in AM is limited due to technological, material and processing constraints. Despite challenges, elastomers have great potential in AM and can be applied in various industries namely automotive, aerospace, healthcare and consumer goods. However, there is a growing interest in expanding the range of elastomers that can be 3D printed. Researchers are experimenting with different approaches to enhance the printability of elastomers such as modifying material composition, material design, optimising printing parameters, control of chemical composition and 3DP techniques. Recent advancements in the structure, properties and printing techniques of elastomers show wide scope for improving their printability. Several elastomeric materials that can be 3D printed include thermoplastic elastomer, thermoplastic polyurethane, liquid silicone rubber, etc. This review paper aims at providing an overview of the current state of AM of elastomers, including the challenges and limitations. It discusses recent advancements and suggests ways to enhance the printability of elastomers in near future, which can help researchers and industry professionals to explore new and unique AM applications.

AB With a growing global awareness of the ecological challenges posed by plastic waste, the integration of recycled materials represents a crucial step to sustainable additive manufacturing of plastic products. To assess the applicability of recycled materials in 3D printing, we extruded recycled polylactic acid (PLA) into filament and printed specimens based on the fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing technology. For comparison purposes, we selected the virgin PLA filament as a reference. With the filament extruder, we produced filaments using virgin PLA pellets, a mixture of virgin pellets and recycled PLA, as well as fully recycled PLA. The extrudability and transferability of filaments were comprehensively investigated under various extrusion temperatures and speeds. Subsequently, using extruded filaments, we printed parts of different shapes such as cubes, tensile specimens, and flexural specimens. We measured the surface roughness, dimensional deviations, and mechanical properties of the printed parts. Results demonstrated that filament extruded from virgin pellets exhibited similar quality and mechanical properties as the virgin filament. Recycled PLA required higher extrusion temperature and speed to extrude filament than virgin PLA and mixed virgin PLA and recycled PLA. The tensile and flexural strength of printed parts from fully recycled PLA were more than 15 % lower than that from virgin filament. These findings contribute valuable insights towards the continued development of environmentally conscious practices in the field of additive manufacturing.

AB 4D printing aims to incorporate a product's blueprint into a flexible, intelligent material using a standard 3D printer. It can be assembled or transformed into the desired design by subjecting the 3D-printed item to specific conditions or forms of stimulation, such as heat, pressure, moisture, pH levels, wind, or light. In essence, 4D printing represents a progression from 3D printing technology, as it can now produce evolving objects. Additive manufacturing involves using 3D printers to create 3D models. However, there are limitations to this method, such as producing static products and having restricted build sizes. To address these challenges, four-dimensional printing was developed, which allows for the transformation of 1D or 2D strands into pre-programmed 3D shapes and the ability to metamorphose between dimensions. 4D printing builds upon 3D printing technology and expands beyond it. It is an emerging technology with the capability to fabricate complex structures. In this review, we explore the fundamentals of 4D printing, the factors that led to its development, the principles governing it, the components used, the 4D printing techniques, the challenges that must be overcome, and the future possibilities of 4D printing.

AB Over the past decade, 3D printing with concrete has been widely adopted worldwide. The primary drivers for this innovation are the reduction in manual labor and the more efficient use of natural resources. New materials that are suitable for 3D printing are developed, which are characterized by rapid setting and robust physical and mechanical properties. In this study, for the first time, ternary gypsum-cement-pozzolanic (GCP) composites were developed and evaluated for use in 3D printing. These composites are associated with durability in water as Portland cement (PC) while maintaining the rapid hardening properties of gypsum. Two types of secondary gypsum-recycled plasterboard gypsum (RG) and phosphogypsum (PG)-were used as the calcium hemihydrate component. The compressive strength test showed that 37 MPa can be achieved, which is comparable to that of traditional PC-based 3D printable mixtures. For the first time in a 3D print test, it was experimentally proved that GCP mixtures have good stability and buildability up to 35 layers. According to Life Cycle Analysis, elaborated material gives a carbon footprint reduction of up to 40%, compared to traditional PC mortar, thus supporting the sustainable use of this innovative composite.

AB Incorporation of renewable resources, green synthesis methods, self-repairability, and recyclability into the fabrication of UV-curing 3D printing materials can greatly improve the sustainability of such advanced materials. In this work, we report the development of castor oil (CO)-based polyurethane acylate resins containing dynamic disulfide bonds (COPUA-SS) for UV-curing 3D printing via a 'one-pot no-solvent' method involving the empolyment of a biobased diluent, tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate, as sovlent. By varying the feed ratios, a set of UVcuring 3D printing materials with tunable thermal, mechnical, and dynamic properties as well as biobased contents were obtained. Notably, the optimal resin (COPUA-SS4) possessed excellent thermal and mechanical properties (a Tg of 94.6 degrees C and tensile strength of 70.4 MPa), high bio-based content (40.3 %), and relatively fast stress relaxation (15.8 min at 180 degrees C). By adding a UV blocker into the optimal resin, excellent UV-curing 3D printing performance were achieved. Furthermore, the 3D printed objects based on the optimal resin demonstrated superior self-repairability, recyclability, and plasticity as well as good shape memory properties. For instance, the materials demonstrated a healing efficiency of 100 % under heating at 160 degrees C for 30 min and a recycling efficiency of tensile modulus up to 168.4 % after the first recycling. This study paves the way to develop UV-curing materials with high performance and more sustainability, which show great promise to be applied in 3D printing structural areas like artefacts.

AB In this paper, the buildability of a mortar incorporated with fine recycled concrete aggregates (recycled sand) for the purpose of 3D printing has been assessed according to the bi-linear thixotropy model. The natural sand from a reference, rheology based mortar for 3D printing, is gradually replaced with recycled sand using replacement rates of 25, 50 and 100 vol%. For each mixture, stress growth tests are performed at resting intervals of 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90 and 120 s to determine the re-flocculation rate (Rthix) of the 3D printing concrete. In addition, the flowability, rheology and initial setting time of the mixtures are measured with slump flow tests, stress -growth tests using a rheometer and Vicat tests. The results show that mortar with recycled sand is less flow -able and has shorter initial setting time compared to the reference mortar for 3D printing. In addition, it is found that recycled sand improves the static yield stress evolution with time of the mixtures which improves the buildability. With recycled sand replacement rates of 25 and 50 vol%, the buildability of the mortar mixture increases respectively 33% and 83%.

AB Year by year, more and more plastic is used worldwide. A large part of post-consumer waste is still stored in landfills instead of being reused. The solution to this problem may be recycled materials (recyclates) or biodegradable materials. The method of 3D printing, regarded as a clean processing technology, can significantly contribute to addressing global plastic pollution by utilizing post-consumer recycled polymers to create new components and parts. Therefore, this study focuses on the assessment of various properties and characteristics of 3D-printed compositions based on post-consumer polypropylene (PP) and rubber crumbs, recycled from packages foils and car tires, respectively. Moreover, within this study, we compared the mechanical performance of the injection molding material with the one obtained from 3D printing. A characterization was made considering the thermal and mechanical properties as well as the "print quality" through the microscopic and tomographic analysis of subsequent print passes, the number of free spaces, and imperfections in the polymer melt. Samples obtained using the FDM and injection methods exhibited comparable melting temperatures, while the samples obtained by injection molding exhibited slightly better mechanical performance, higher hardness, and impact strength.

AB This study seeks to advance the realm of 3D printing through the exploration of fabricating polymer matrix composite objects using recycled materials, with a particular emphasis on bolstering durability. Characterization was carried out by integrating polyurethane foam (PUF) residues into thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) composites at different concentrations (ranging from 3% to 10% wt/wt), which are frequently employed in 3D printing. The chemical functions were analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), while thermal stability was measured through thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The morphology characterized of the material via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and density measurement identified that the surface roughness and void content of the PUF/TPU composite materials was a significant factor affecting the measured mechanical properties. Experimental results indicate that higher PUF content enhances filament properties and the resultant 3D printed products, showcasing a reduction in both the density and melt index of the produced filament by 15.9% and 34.4%, respectively, with the addition of 5% wt./wt. PUF residues to TPU. Additionally, there was a notable increase in Young's modulus of the produced filament by 79.9% and maximum stress by 12.7%, while elongation at break was reduced by 24.9%. Furthermore, the study highlights the sustainability advantages of utilizing recycled PUF, contributing to waste reduction and associated cost savings. Recycled PUF emerges as a cost-effective additive for synthesizing 3D polymeric materials, holding promise for diverse applications such as orthopedic footwear, leveraging the desirable attributes of TPU. Highlights Recycled (PUF)/TPU composites for 3D printing, enhancing durability. PUF content improves filament properties, reducing density and melt index. Young's modulus and maximum stress of produced filament increases. Utilizing recycled PUF reduces waste and promises sustainability.

AB Recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (RABS) has undesirable thermal properties that cause the material to shrink and not adhere to the printing bed during three-dimensional (3D) printing. In order to address this issue, virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (VABS) of varying weight proportions (i.e., 10-50%) is blended with RABS to fabricate parts at various printing temperatures (i.e., 230 degrees C, 240 degrees C, and 250 degrees C). The study emphasizes to achieve proper inter-layer bonding and enhancing the physical and mechanical characteristics of the final product made from RABS. It was found that blending of VABS up to 40% in RABS with components fabricated at 240 degrees C resulted in the highest improvement in physical and mechanical properties. The 60% RABS/40%VABS sample printed at 240 degrees C exhibits improvements in Young's modulus (E), yield strength (& sigma;y), and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) by 13.69%, 13.37%, and 15.64%, respectively. Moreover, the RABS sample blended with 20% VABS exhibited comparable flexural results to the 100% VABS samples as blending VABS enhances molecular chain bonding and provides better elasticity to the material.

AB This study addresses environmental concerns related to construction and demolition waste (CDW), which constitutes 35-40% of global waste. It explores the potential use of recycled fine aggregates (RFA) from concrete demolition waste as a sustainable alternative to natural fine aggregates in 3D printed mortar (3DPM). By conducting a systematic literature review (SLR) and utilizing VOSviewer for bibliometric analysis, the research assesses the mechanical properties, flowability, extrudability, and buildability of RFAs in 3DPM. The analysis also highlights key trends in keywords and research distribution across different countries. The findings reveal that while RFAs in 3DPM slightly reduce compressive and flexural strengths compared to natural aggregates, they significantly contribute to environmental sustainability by reducing landfill waste and conserving natural resources. The study underscores the importance of further research to optimize RFA-based mixtures for wider application in 3D printing technologies.
   Recycled fine aggregates (RFAs) from construction waste are suitable for eco-friendly 3D printing applications.3DPM with RFAs has reduced mechanical strength but remains viable for structural use.Optimizing RFA mix designs can enhance both sustainability and performance in 3D-printed concrete structures.

AB PurposeThe current study aims to develop a 3D-printed continuous metal fiber-reinforced recycled thermoplastic composite using an in-nozzle impregnation technique.Design/methodology/approachRecycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (RABS) plastic was blended with virgin ABS (VABS) plastic in a ratio of 60:40 weight proportion to develop a 3D printing filament that was used as a matrix material, while post-used continuous brass wire (CBW) was used as a reinforcement. 3D printing was done by using a self-customized print head to fabricate the flexural, compression and interlaminar shear stress (ILSS) test samples to evaluate the bending, compressive and ILSS properties of the build samples and compared with VABS and RABS-B samples. Moreover, the physical properties of the samples were also analyzed.FindingsUpon three-point bend, compression and ILSS testing, it was found that RABS-B/CBW composite 3D printed with 0.7 mm layer width exhibited a notable improvement in maximum flexural load (Lmax), flexural stress at maximum load (sfmax), flex modulus (Ef) and work of fracture (WOF), compression modulus (Ec) and ILSS properties by 30.5%, 49.6%, 88.4% 13.8, 21.6% and 30.3% respectively.Originality/valueLimited research has been conducted on the in-nozzle impregnation technique for 3D printing metal fiber-reinforced recycled thermoplastic composites. Adopting this method holds the potential to create durable and high-strength sustainable composites suitable for engineering applications, thereby diminishing dependence on virgin materials.

AB When molten, used vehicle tyres are unable to decompose or be recycled. Despite global efforts to find new uses for these materials, many worn tyres are still dumped in landfills. Therefore, this study proposes using ground tyre rubber (GTR) as a fill material for recycled polypropylene 3D printing filament. The filament composite's physical and mechanical properties will be assessed in this investigation. GTR is expected to give the filament elastic characteristics, which could lead to rubber-like filaments. This study filled recycled polypropylene (rPP) polymer matrix composites with GTR to make filament. The mechanical and physical properties of a 3D-printed specimen made from rPP and GTR filament with varying compositions were analysed. Compared to pure rPP, rPP/GTR samples with 3 wt% GTR had a maximum tensile strength of 716.76 MPa. The flexural test findings showed that rPP/GTR with 3 wt% GTR had the highest flexural strength at 80.53 MPa, followed by rPP/1 wt% GTR at 65.38 MPa. In physical tests, the rPP/GTR at 5 wt% GTR had the highest water absorption at 5.41 %, and the wt% of GTR connected directly with water absorption. This study has shown that affordable, environmentally friendly rPP/ GTR filaments can be developed with less amount of GTR content (3 wt%) and used for 3D printing applications, helping to lessen the impact of plastic and waste while having valuable mechanical and physical properties that are comparable to those of the pure polypropylene material produced.

AB Recycled sand (RS) as an environmental-friendly building material, has shown great prospects for the digital construction of buildings. In this study, 3D printed recycled sand concrete (3DPRSC) mixed with RS was prepared, and the related compressive strength and constitutive relationships were investigated on different RS replacement ratios and construction methods. The geometric characteristics and spatial distribution of pore defects were analyzed by the combined X-CT and MIP, and the microscopic morphology of RS and natural sand was analyzed by SEM. The results showed that the compressive strength and constitutive curves have apparent anisotropic char-acteristics. With the increase in the RS replacement rate, the compressive strength tended to decrease. The ellipsoidal pore geometry's arrangement of 3DPRSC extruded pore defects differs in different printing directions, and the pore defect distribution characteristics vary with the accumulated height of the filaments and the printing direction. The mechanism of the formation and distribution of extruded pore defects on the compressive strength and constitutive relation-ship was analyzed, and a model of the constitutive curve based on extruded pore defects and anisotropy was established, which provided a theoretical basis for the nonlinear analysis of the engineering structure of 3DPRSC.

AB This paper examines how extrusion-based 3D-printing technology is evolving, utilising geopolymers (GPs) as sustainable inorganic aluminosilicate materials. Particularly, the current state of 3D-printing geopolymers is critically examined in this study from the perspectives of the production process, printability need, mix design, early-age material features, and sustainability, with an emphasis on the effects of various elements including the examination of the fresh and hardened properties of 3D-printed geopolymers, depending on the matrix composition, reinforcement type, curing process, and printing configuration. The differences and potential of two-part and one-part geopolymers are also analysed. The applications of advanced printable geopolymer materials and products are highlighted, along with some specific examples. The primary issues, outlooks, and paths for future efforts necessary to advance this technology are identified.

AB Utilising recycled brick aggregate in cementitious mixtures can decrease the overdependency on limited natural resources and improve the sustainability of concrete. This paper presents a potential solution to lower the amount of waste being landfilled and increase the sustainability of 3D concrete printing technology by combining low-carbon ternary blended cement with recycled aggregates. Hence, the effect of incorporating two types of recycled brick aggregate- clay brick (CBA) and engineering brick (EBA) on the properties of 3D printable ternary blended cement were investigated. The natural aggregate in a pre-existing 3D printable blend was substituted by up to 50 wt.-% with two varieties of recycled brick aggregates available throughout Europe. The recycled brick aggregates underwent characterisation to determine their properties. The fresh property evaluation using the green strength test was used to assess the effect of aggregate replacements on the mixture's shape stability. The mechanical performance of mixtures containing CBA and EBA, both cast and 3D printable mixes, was evaluated and compared to that of the control sample. The results indicated that incorporating recycled brick aggregate enhances green strength and Young's modulus significantly. Mechanical strength performance showed significant enhancement when incorporating RBA, which reached up to 67% and 55% for both cast and 3D printing methods, respectively. The suitability of the developed mix formulations for 3D printing was assessed by printing cylindrical objects.

AB The utilisation of three-dimensional (3D) printing has become a well-established method for fabricating structural components across various materials such as polymers, metals and ceramics. Within this domain, multi-material 3D printing emerges as a pivotal advancement, offering prospects for rapid manufacturing, customised design, and structural innovation. Particularly, the incorporation of recycled materials into multi-material printing holds promise for promoting sustainability and recyclability in manufacturing processes. By leveraging multi-material printing techniques and incorporating recycled materials, this study aims to advance the sustainability agenda within manufacturing practices while concurrently exploring avenues to enhance material performance for practical engineering applications. This study focuses on the multi-material printing of pure polylactic acid (PLA) alongside recycled polylactic acid (rPLA), employing fused deposition modelling (FDM) as a cost-effective 3D printing technique. The research aims to identify the optimal composition for achieving desired material properties by exploring different percentages and layer placements of recycled material in combination with pure PLA. Detailed analysis of the mechanical properties of these 3D printed components was conducted, with the experimental results further validated through analysis of variance. The results of this study emphasis the mechanical advantages associated with the utilisation of multi-material 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the incorporation of both PLA and rPLA materials highlights the potential sustainability benefits inherent in these approaches.

AB 3D printing cement-based materials are often mortars based on a considerable amount of binder materials and high-quality fine sands. Indeed, most of the research and realized projects are 3D-printed fine-grained mortars with round or crushed natural sand. As raw materials for construction materials, especially high-quality sands, are becoming less available, this research project aims to use 100% recycled aggregates (RA) for 3D printing concrete with a maximum grain size of 8 mm. In addition to incorporating 100% recycled aggregates (RA), the goal is to develop 3D printing material with a reduced Global Warming Potential (GWP), e.g., by using low binder - especially Portland cement - contents. Therefore, a packing density optimization was performed to reduce the amount of Portland cement below 200 kg/m(3). This paper overviews the first results on fresh and hardened concrete properties using 100% RA for 3D printing concrete and low cement content.

AB In recent years, digital construction methods, such as 3D-printing with concrete, have seen a surge in interest. They address many challenges currently encountered in the construction industry. However, for the digital construction to be successful, both in terms of sustainability and cost-effectiveness, the 3D printable materials must fulfil high requirements, particularly regarding their rheological and mechanical properties. The use of environmentally friendly materials with low clinker content, such as Limestone-Calcined-Clay-Cement (LC3), could further reduce the carbon footprint of these processes. Additionally, integrating recycled aggregate into the 3D printable mix (Printable Recycled Aggregate Concrete: PRAC) could promote resource conservation, environmental protection, and energy efficiency. This study investigates the time-dependent development of the static yield stress and the structural build-up by means of a rapid penetration test and a newly proposed modified cone geometry. These tests enable to realistically describe the material behaviour of new, environmentally friendly 3D printable mixtures with coarse aggregates. The results attained provide a foundation for future efforts to use demolition materials more efficiently in 3D concrete printing.

AB This paper presents a critical review of reducing the life-cycle environmental impact of 3D printing concrete (3DPC) systems from the perspectives of material preparation, construction process and structure level. The material requirements of 3DPC are first introduced, then the utilization of low-carbon cementitious materials, recycled aggregates, admixture and fibres in 3DPC is explored, along with their effect on workability and mechanical property. The potential for improving the environmental benefits by applying better design and printing parameters are discussed in the subsequent part. Two main delivery systems and the effect of printing parameters (including printing speed, standoff distance) are presented. Finally, the behaviour of 3D printing components (beam, slab and column) is examined at the structural level. 3D printing technology has a high degree of freedom, thus better understanding of the component behaviour can save materials and improve strength. Finding a balance between component's performance and environmental impact is a crucial work in future.

AB In the present study, a thermoplastic-reinforced composite filament for 3D printing applications was created by mixing short glass fibers (SGF) with the thermoplastic matrix made from plastic waste. Short glass fiber-reinforced recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) blend thermoplastic composite filaments were first prepared by a plastic extrusion machine. The produced filaments' physical, mechanical, and thermal properties were investigated. After achieving the desired filament, a 3D printing technology called material extrusion was utilized to create 3D sample parts. The mechanical properties of each printed sample were analyzed following ASTM standards, and their morphological structures were also studied at various weight percentages (pure rHDPE, rHDPE/rPET (75/25 %), rHDPE/rPET reinforced with 15 % SGF, and rHDPE/rPET reinforced with 30 % SGF wt%). From the study, a 52 % increase in tensile strength, 32 % in Young's modulus, and a 50 % reduction in elongation with the addition of 30 wt% of SGF to rHDPE/rPET were noted compared to pure rHDPE. Generally, 3D printable composite filaments can be developed through the incorporation of SGF into plastic waste. This has tremendous advantages for solving environmental pollution and achieving sustainable development.

AB As the use of 3D-printed concrete becomes more prevalent, the need for effective recycling methods becomes paramount. This study addresses this concern by exploring the repurposing of 3D-printed concrete waste as an aggregate in normal-strength concrete for C30/37 and C40/50 classes, covering both fine and coarse aggregates in its particle size distribution. The extent of recycled aggregate (RA) replacement was determined through sieve analysis. A two-stage investigation assessed the compressive strength performance of the concrete specimens. The initial stage produced reference specimens with no replacement, representing conventional concrete. In the second stage, variable specimens incorporated 50% and 67% recycled aggregate (RA) from 3D-printed concrete waste. Results revealed that in C40/50, both the 50% and 67% replacements consistently exhibited a higher strength than 0%. In C30/37, the 50% replacement displayed decreased strength compared to the 0% and 67%, while the 67% replacement consistently showed superior strength. Adjusting the water content impacted strength; at 67%, slight variations occurred, while at 50%, extra water led to a significant decrease. An overarching discovery is that the efficacy of the 67% replacement level holds regardless of the concrete strength class.

AB Recently, researchers have shown great interest in the development of biobased and reprintable 3D printing materials for sustainable 3D printing. Herein, a method for developing plant oil (PO)-based digital light processing (DLP) printing resins that are both reprocessable and reprintable is proposed. Biobased UV-curable monomers (POPITs) containing dynamic hindered urea bonds (HUBs) from POs were synthesized via the thiol-ene click reaction. A range of DLP printing resins (POPIT-I) with high biobased content (52.6%-58.1%) were prepared by blending POPITs with the biobased dilute monomer isobornyl acrylate. These resins demonstrated good mechanical and thermal properties (e.g., tensile strength: 45.1-49.5 MPa and Tg: 74-92 degrees C), as well as high DLP printing quality. Reprocessable DLP printing was employed to fabricate large-volume parts through the dissociation and reorganization of HUBs, thereby reducing printing difficulty and printing time. Additionally, a powder blending and modification method was used to recycle and reprint printed materials. The printing materials, including printed green parts and discarded supporting materials, were milled into micron-sized powders and then blended with POPIT-I to prepare the powder blending resins. The milled powders in the powder blending resins were further modified by 2-(tert-butylamino) ethyl methacrylate to prepare reprinting resins. This process resulted in the grafting of C = C onto the powder surface, which eliminated heterogeneity between the powders and POPIT-I. The mechanical and thermal properties of the reprinting resins were comparable with those of POPIT-I even after three rounds of recycling. Furthermore, the reprinting method reported here is applicable to other dynamic covalent bond-based 3D printing systems.

AB The development of sustainable biobased vitrimeric materials is critical for the environment. Herein, UV-curable resins composed of the monomers derived from glycerol, soybean oil, and hemicellulose have been designed and applied in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. The use of hemicellulose-derived monomer tetrahy-drofurfuryl methacrylate for resins can increase the tensile strength that is used to calculate the reprocessability efficiency. The vitrimeric properties of the resulting polymers such as shape memory, weldability, repairability, and reprocessability have been investigated. The most suitable resin for DLP 3D printing containing a sufficient amount of hydroxyl and ester groups that are essential in transesterification reactions has been selected ac-cording to the results of the real-time Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and real-time photorheometry measurements. By activating dynamic transesterification reactions at elevated temperatures, the 3D printed samples exhibited shape memory, repairability, and reprocessability properties. A recovery ratio of 100 %, repairability with improved tensile strength by 2 times, and a recycling efficiency of 344 % was reached by incorporating tetrahydrofurfuryl methacrylate into the resins. The recycling efficiency achieved is 10 times higher compared to a similar vitrimer based on glycerol and soybean oil.

AB To facilitate the ongoing transition toward a circular economy, renewable 3D print materials that are both sustainable and competitive must be accessible. However, the growing demand for bio-based thermosetting resins, which are used as ink for vat photopolymerization, gives rise to environmental concerns in terms of plastic waste management. Therefore, photocurable materials that are renewable and recyclable at the same time are needed. In this work, a mechanically robust and reprocessable 3D printed photopolymer is developed from renewable feedstock. Reaction of malic acid with glycidyl methacrylate introduces both methacrylate moieties that can undergo photopolymerization in the 3D printer, and beta-hydroxyester linkages that can act as dynamic crosslinks via bond exchange reactions. By combining modified malic acid with reactive diluents, a photoinitiator, and phosphate catalyst, three distinct resins are formulated, resulting in bio-based contents ranging from 43% to 49%. The formulations demonstrate good layer fusion and accurate print quality, while the 3D printed specimens are robust and thermally stable. Notably, the printed object with shortest relaxation time displayed Arrhenius flow behavior with an activation energy of 36.0 kJ mol-1, and its mechanical performance is maintained after being recycled three times. This contributes to the end-of-life perspective of photocurable resins in additive manufacturing.
   In this study, bio-based photopolymers based on methacrylated malic acid (MAMA) are developed for 3D printing and recycling. While methacrylate groups in MAMA undergo vat photopolymerization, beta-hydroxyester linkages incorporated in the printed network act as dynamic crosslinks during reprocessing. Mechanical properties are maintained up to three reprocessing cycles, thereby contributing to the end-of-life perspective of photocurable resins in additive manufacturing. image

AB This study investigates the effects of layer offset on the mechanical strengths of 3D-printed mortar containing milled recycled carbon fibres (rCF). Compared to previous works, the printing scale of carbon-fibre reinforced mortar is increased to move closer to the stage of practical engineering application. For different fibre content, 1.5 vol% is recommended as the optimum fibre dosage for the mortar printing. Three degrees of layer offset are designed for the unidirectional printing pattern, including 0%, 25% and 50% of the filament width as the nozzle drifting distance. X-ray micro-computed tomography analysis demonstrates the internal pore structures in printed specimens consist of channel pores between filaments and micro pores within filaments. The channel pores are generally less geometrically regular than micro pores. Increasing the offset degree leads to improved compressive and flexural strengths along different loading directions. The increase in the compressive strength is more substantial along the direction of layer deposition and lateral expansion compared to the printing direction. Printed specimens with 25% and 50% layer offset also exhibit a much lower level of anisotropy in compression than those without offset. As the degree of layer offset rises, the total porosity decreases and the volume percentage of micro pores in total pores increases, thereby rendering less severe stress concentration around defects and strengthening the mechanical performance of printed specimens. The experiment results show the 3Dprinted mortar containing milled rCF with layer offset, normally serving for self-sensing purpose, has the potential to achieve decent mechanical properties for large-scale industrial printing.

AB Selective copper recovery from copper tailings reduces environmental pollution caused by mining activities and provides a valuable source of copper. Furthermore, polymer waste accumulation and handling small functional materials like resins remains challenging. In this study, a 3D-printed adsorbent for selective copper recovery from copper tailings was designed by functionalizing recycled polymer with a chelating resin and 3D-printing using selective laser sintering technique. The 3D-printed adsorbent was characterized, and its adsorption performance examined under varying conditions. The adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherm fitted well to the pseudosecond-order kinetics and Langmuir isotherm models, suggesting chemical and monolayer adsorption processes. FTIR indicated coordination as the possible adsorption mechanism. Thermodynamics revealed an endothermic process. The 3D-printed adsorbent demonstrated an excellent Cu(II) adsorption, high selectivity towards Cu(II), and reusability. This work offers a promising 3D-printed adsorbent for selective Cu(II) recovery, while also addressing polymer waste and particle handling issues.

AB In recent times, FDM technology has been extensively utilized to reuse small-scale thermoplastic waste materials to produce 3D-printed structures for various engineering applications. However, recycled material such as PET (i.e., waste from beverage bottling) for 3D printing is less explored because of poor mechanical properties due to possible thermal degradation, uncontrolled crystallinity, and shrinkage issues during high fusion temperatures. Hence, the aim of this study is to develop high-quality filament from PET waste for 3D printing purpose. This study involves the investigation of rheological, chemical, thermal, and mechanical behavior of PET filaments produced by different grades of PET plastic waste. The results indicated that filament made from recycled PET (RPET) water bottles and RPET soda bottles have comparable results with virgin PET (VPET) filament samples. The tensile modulus, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and tensile strain at break for RPET water bottle and RPET soda bottle made filament are 1932.78 MPa, 47.51 MPa, 52.44 MPa, and 98.86%; and 2009.66 MPa, 43.08 MPa, 46.08 MPa, and 7.46%, respectively. The novel filament produced from PET plastic waste has the capability to replace VPET filaments for fabricating high-quality structural parts through an additive manufacturing approach.

AB This paper studies the thermal, morphological, and mechanical properties of 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA) blends of virgin and recycled material in the following proportions: 100/0, 25/75, 50/50, and 75/25, respectively. Real waste, used as recycled content, was shredded and sorted by size without a washing step. Regular dog-bone specimens were 3D printed from filaments, manufactured in a single screw extruder. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that adding PLA debris to raw material did not significantly impact the thermal stability of the 3D-printed samples and showed that virgin and recycled PLA degraded at almost the same temperature. Differential scanning calorimetry revealed a significant reduction in crystallinity with increasing recycled content. Scanning electron microscopy showed a more homogenous structure for specimens from 100% pure PLA, as well as a more heterogeneous one for PLA blends. The tensile strength of the PLA blends increased by adding more recycled material, from 44.20 +/- 2.18 MPa for primary PLA to 52.61 +/- 2.28 MPa for the blend with the highest secondary PLA content. However, this study suggests that the mechanical properties of the reprocessed parts and their basic association are unique compared with those made up of virgin material.

AB The advantage of 3DCP technologies is the ability to fabricate free-form structures. However, printing openings in concrete structures are limited by the presence of overhanging sections. While various 3D printing and additive manufacturing technologies have established methods for handling overhangs with temporary supports, many existing techniques for 3D concrete printing still rely on wooden planks and corbelling, which restrict the design flexibility and slope angles. The objective of this study is to develop a removable and sustainable support material with high printability performance. This support material serves as temporary support for overhang sections in 3D-printed structures and can be removed once the primary concrete has hardened sufficiently. This study observed that increasing the recycled glass content in the mixture raises both the dynamic and static yield stresses, with only mixtures containing up to 60% recycled glass remaining pumpable. Optimization of the mixture design aimed to balance high flowability and buildability, and the results indicated that a mixture with 60% recycled glass content is optimal. The effectiveness of the optimized support material was validated through the successful printing of a structure featuring a free-form opening and overhang section.

AB The ageing and recycling of polyamide 12 (PA12) powder are key issues in selective laser sintering (SLS) processing, while hygroscopicity is an important defect of PA12 products during use. This paper aims to correlate PA12 powder recycling with changes in the hygroscopicity of printed parts, which is significant for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of ageing on the performance of PA12 parts. PA12 powder was utilized in different grades: virgin, post-industrial recycled, and virgin-post-industrial recycled mixture (virgin-to-post-industrial recycled powder weight ratio of 25/75). The mutual effects of the powder grade, print orientation used in the building process, and absorbed moisture on the properties of printed parts were evaluated. Molar mass increase and secondary crystallization have been demonstrated in the post-industrial recycled powder, being responsible for the worse sintering quality in the SLS process. Therefore, the printed parts made from the postindustrial recycled powder or the virgin-post-industrial recycled powder mixture exhibited worse mechanical strength, a higher porosity, and hence a higher level of hygroscopicity in terms of moisture absorption and wettability. On the contrary, the printed parts made from the virgin powder were found to be more moisture- sensitive in terms of the decline in mechanical strength in the wet state because of the higher content of the amorphous phase holding the plasticizing water.

TI Recycling Large-Format 3D Printed Polymer Composite Formworks Used for
   Casting Precast Concrete - Technical Feasibility and Challenges
SO JOURNAL OF COMPOSITES FOR CONSTRUCTION

ID THERMAL-PROPERTIES; MOLECULAR-WEIGHT; EXTRUSION; WASTE
AB The use of large-format three-dimensional (3D) printed thermoplastic composites as formworks for precast concrete structures has emerged as a cost-effective solution addressing challenges related to skilled labor shortages and enabling design optimization. This research work investigates the technical feasibility of recycling large-format 3D printed polymer composite formworks. Thermomechanical recycling of 3D printed formworks was implemented and the recycled polymer composite feedstock was used to 3D print new formworks. Two commonly used short-fiber reinforced polymer composite materials were evaluated: one petroleum-based material, carbon fiber-filled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (CF-ABS), and one biobased material, wood flour-filled amorphous polylactic acid (WF-aPLA). Mechanical properties of 3D printed specimens were characterized to evaluate their suitability as 3D printed formworks. Physical and thermal characterization methods were used to understand the change in thermal and mechanical properties of the thermoplastic polymers due to the recycling process. The study also employed similar methods to assess the potential contamination of polymer composites with cementitious materials. Results revealed that high-pressure water washing was effective in removing cementitious material from the formwork surface, and the recycled material did not show significant contamination. Thermomechanical recycling was shown to reduce the fiber length of reinforcing fibers and the molecular weight of the polymer material. The reduction in fiber length and the molecular weight of the material results in the reduction of material viscosity. The observed reductions in viscosity have the potential to limit the number of recycling iterations. However, thermal stability was maintained throughout all processing levels. In addition, the mechanical performance of the WF-aPLA material system was observed to increase after the recycling process. However, the mechanical performance of the CF-ABS material system was observed to decrease after recycling. Recycled 3D printed formworks were found to work effectively, albeit some reduction in mechanical properties of recycled formworks was observed.
   Large-format three-dimensional (3D) printed polymer composite formworks have been used to cast precast concrete structures. Currently, the formworks are disposed of in a landfill, once they have been used to cast the necessary number of precast concrete parts. If the 3D printed formworks could be recycled to make new formworks, the material cost of 3D printed thermoplastic composites could be significantly reduced while also making 3D printed formworks environmentally friendly. This research assesses the viability of thermomechanical recycling and reusing 3D printed thermoplastic composite formworks. The changes in material properties of thermomechanically recycled composites were studied. The effectiveness of cleaning the formwork using high-pressure water wash was investigated and the efficacy of using recycled 3D printed thermoplastic formwork was evaluated. The steps involved in manufacturing large format 3D printed formwork and recycling are described, and the challenges in each of these steps are discussed.

DE 3D printed concrete; Compressive strength; Printing path; Concrete age;
   Stress -strain relationship
AB As an intelligent construction technology, 3D printed concrete has made great progress in recent years, but research on the development law of hardened mechanical properties of 3D printed concrete is relatively limited, and the influence of printing path on compressive behavior of 3D printed concrete still needs further research. This paper proposed a new printing path for extrusion based 3D printed concrete and investigated the compressive behavior of hardened concrete printed by the new printing path. The effect of printing path, concrete age, printing speed, specimen size, and replacement of natural sand by recycled sand were evaluated through compressive tests of specimens printed by different path at different ages. Compared with the traditional printing path, the new printing path could increase peak strain, elastic modulus, and cubic compressive strength of the printed concrete. The new printing path provided a preferable alternative solution for printed concrete subjected to compression. The results also indicate that the compressive strength of printed concrete at 3 days can reach 45%-62% of the 28-day compressive strength, and the compressive strength at 7 days appears to achieve 68%-89% of the 28-day compressive strength, and the printing path has minor effect on the development rate of compressive strength. Based on the test data analyses, an analytical model was proposed to describe the stress-strain relationship of concrete printed by two printing paths.

AB This research aims to explore the potential of 3D Particle Bed Printing (3DPBP) as an additive manufacturing technique for sustainable construction applications. The study focuses on the utilization of different cementitious binders, including a Portland cement free option (calcium sulfoaluminate cement), in combination with recycled sand to create environmentally friendly building components. The research investigates the printability and mechanical properties of 3DPBP printed objects, with a specific emphasis on compressive strength. The incorporation of recycled sand as a byproduct of construction and demolition waste treatment adds an eco-friendly dimension to the process, contributing to the circular economy. The paper underscores the significance of optimizing material compositions to achieve desired performance characteristics while minimizing the demand for natural resources. The results of this ongoing research are expected to shed light on the potential of 3DPBP to rethink the construction industry and advance sustainable building practices.

AB Oceanic plastic pollution has become one of the most serious problems in terms of the environment, and Circular Economy (CE) strategies are being implemented to reduce it. The article presents the results of a diagnosis of plastic waste in the maritime sector and the use of 3D printing as an enabling technology of CE around plastic. Maritime industries were asked about their plastic waste generation and potential parts and components which could be replaced by equivalent parts made by 3D printing. To close the CE loop, these parts would be printed with filament from the maritime industries' plastic waste. The article addresses this process of generating filament that enables the CE and how this printing process can be affected and corrected under on-board conditions. A polypropylene-based strapping tape waste was chosen to produce recycled filament. This filament resulted stiffer than the commercial filament and, through an additivation process, it achieved better flexural properties. Finally, the 3D printing process during on-board unstable conditions was improved by an automatic and electronic correction on the 3D printer machine itself.

AB Additive manufacturing of concrete (3D printed concrete, 3DPC), is an emerging technology with numerous possible applications and benefits for the digital transition of the construction industry. At the same time, there remain open questions about the environmental suitability of 3DPC. One such aspect is its circularity, i.e. recyclability. Therefore, in this study, the viability of recycling 3DPC is studied on normal- and high-strength 3DPC concretes produced with 0-100% of fine recycled aggregate (fRA). Aftertesting for basic mechanical properties, the specimens were crushed and new (2nd generation) fRA were obtained and tested. The results point to a high potential for recyclability of 3DPC and fRA conducive to multi- recycling and CO2 uptake through carbonation.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) (also known as 3D printing) has enabled the customized fabrication of objects with complex geometries and functionalities in mechanical and electrical properties. AM technologies commonly use polymers and composites and have been advancing in a variety of industrial and emerging applications. Despite recent progress in 3D printing of polymer composites, many challenges, such as the suboptimal quality of manufactured products and limited material available for 3D printing, need to be addressed for the broad adoption of additively manufactured polymer composites. This review first provides a brief history of AM technologies along with 3D printing polymers. Subsequently, we discuss the state-of-the-art for the design of polymers and filling materials, the principles of AM processes, and emerging applications of 3D printed polymer and composites. Finally, we share our outlook of potential problems and challenges presented in AM of polymer composites, which might lead to future research directions.

DT Article

ID CHAIN EXTENSION; CONSTRUCTION
AB The suitability of recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (R-PET) for 3D-printing applications was evaluated by studying the melt flow characteristics of the polymer. R-PET is known to experience significant deterioration in its mechanical properties when recycled due to molecular weight loss that results from reprocessing. Lower molecular weight hinders R-PET from being 3D-printable due to low viscosity and melt strength. The hypothesis was that R-PET can be modified with reasonable effort and resources to a 3D-printable thermoplastic if the low viscosity problem is tackled. Higher viscosity will enhance both the melt strength and the melt flow characteristic of the polymer, making it more suitable for processing and 3D printing. Reactive extrusion was selected as the method for modifying the polymer to achieve the objective via a coupling reaction with chain extender PMDA (pyromellitic dianhydride). A decrease in the melt flow index (MFI) from 90 to 1.2 (g/10 min) was recorded when PMDA was added at 0.75 wt% which lowered the MFI of modified R-PET to a comparable value to commercial 3D-printing filaments. Furthermore, FT-IR analysis was performed to investigate the chemical composition of the product. Finally, a 3D-printing filament was made from the modified R-PET by mimicking the main processing stations that exist in the filament-making process, which are the extrusion stage, water bath cooling stage and spooling stage. With 0.75 wt% PMDA, the melt strength was satisfactory for pulling the filament and, therefore, a filament with on-spec dimension was produced. Finally, a small object was successfully 3D-printed using the filament product at a minimum recommended temperature of 275 degrees C.

AB Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is one of the established thermoplastics for bio-sensing applications, and several studies have been reported on the use of this material as tactile sensors. But hitherto little has been reported on 3D printing of primary (1 degrees) recycled PVDF-based sensors in lower C-band applications (for miniaturization, flexibility, and wearability features). This study reports the 3D printing of 1 degrees recycled PVDF-based flexible and wearable miniaturized sensors for lower C-band applications. The 1 degrees recycled PVDF substrate (for the sensor) was 3D printed by using fused filament fabrication. The ring resonator technique and transmission line method were used to ascertain the dielectric constant (3.3) and loss tangent (similar to 0.003) of the substrate. The prepared sensor has a return loss of approximate to - 20 dB at 4.1 GHz and shows good conformability for bending up to 70 mm replicating the human body part. The specific absorption rate was recorded to be 0.6W/kg. Further, the negligible variation in S-parameter during the in vitro testing validates the adopted method and supports the use of miniaturized sensors for lower C-band applications.

AB Three-dimensional printing is an innovative technique which is offering advantages in engineering in terms of modeling and processing, even shapes and geometries which are complex and are difficult to be manufactured with other methods. This novel digital technology provides advantages in production process of an individualized 3D object when compared to subtractive computer numeric controlled methods and conventional dentistry techniques. Applied digital work-flow in dentistry embraces data acquisition with intraoral scanning, object design in CAD software and 3D printing with corresponding materials on adequate 3D printer. With the utilization of the 3D techniques, it is possible to make adequate digital models and to reproduce them with enough precision, which led to a transformation in dentistry practice and a wide range of present and possible future applications.
   An important benefit regarding 3D printing in dental practice is the fact that various materials can be used, such as polymers, resins, metals, ceramics etc., even multiple different materials during one production process, if needed. On the other side, there is a handful of available AM techniques depending on the model geometry complexity and desired accuracy. Implementation of 3D technologies proved to be beneficial in laboratory and clinical settings, surgical and restorative dentistry, and continues to expand in research and dental education. The aim of this article was to give one perspective and to review the techniques, materials and current applications of 3D printing in dentistry. As well, significance of waste and recycling of materials used for printing in this area is pointed out.

AB In this study, a new method was established to repeatedly recycle/reuse photocured acrylic resins in 3D printed products. Discarded 3D-printed dental models were ground into micrometer-size recycled powder by the ball milling process. The recycled resin prepared through planetary mixing can be printed into accurate models under low solid content (<30 per hundred kilograms of resin, phr), yet the poor reflowing property of higher solid content limits the amount of recovery. Further blending and de-aggregation by a high-shear-force three roller mill make the recycled resins exhibit great suspension stability over 3 days and in addition to low viscosity (<5 Pa s) for fine DLP printing. The recycled-resin-printed samples showed excellent accuracy (variation: x-y direction<1%, thickness<3%) with low roughness (<1 mu m). In Comparing with printed objects from pristine resin, objects from 50 phr recycled resin possess a similar tensile strength of 30 MPa and a better compressive strength performance of 153 MPa. Moreover, the products from recycling studies using 50 phr resin retained great printing accuracy and preserved the same mechanical properties. The prepared recycled resin can also be directly used for the production of customized, detailed, and low-roughness dental models, demonstrating the potential of this recycling method for practical applications.

AB Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, using large amounts of personal protective equipment (PPE) throughout the world has extensively increased in recent years. The lack of a practical method to dispose of these recycled materials is one of the main concerns of researchers. Hence, comprehensive experimental tests were conducted in the present study to investigate the feasibility of using disposable gloves in mortars to achieve a sustainable mixture. Accordingly, latex and vinyl gloves as recycled fibers were considered in the experimental program to improve the sustainability of 3D printing concrete. As using these recycled materials causes some deficiencies for printing layers, different mineral and chemical admixtures were used in the present study, including graphene oxide nanomaterials, polyvinyl alcohol, Cloisite 15A nanoclay, and micro silica fume. Also, the hybrid use of latex, vinyl, and polypropylene (PP) fiber was considered to improve the printability of concrete mixtures containing waste fibers. Moreover, the effect of internal reinforcement was also considered by using plain steel wire mesh to increase the composite behavior of printed layers in this simplified experimental program. Results indicate that the synergic influence of recycled fibers and admixtures meaningfully enhanced the 3D printing properties of mortar so that about 20%, 80%, 50%, and more than 100% improvements were obtained for workability, direct tensile strength, flexural strength, and buildability index respectively. However, an average percentage - 28.3% reduction was recorded for the concrete compressive strength. Sustainability analysis also showed that using waste disposable gloves considerably reduced CO2 emissions.

AB The rapid growth of the electronics industry is producing excessive electronic waste. One of the common types of materials in electronic waste is high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). In this study, HIPS from electronic waste was recycled through an extrusion process and used as a 3D print filament. The effects of recycling on printability, physical properties, and mechanical properties in horizontal and vertical directions were examined. It was found that until the fourth-cycle, mechanical properties such as horizontal tensile strength, horizontal flexural strength, vertical flexural strength, and vertical impact strength were comparable with virgin commercial filament. In addition, the vertical flexural modulus in the fourth cycle increased by 77.28%. However, the density of recycled HIPs' first to the fourth cycle slightly decreased by 10.6%, and the melt flow rate increased by 20.3%. It was also observed that until the third cycle, the effect of the reprocessing steps was insignificant on the defect of the 3D-printed product. In general, the experiments show various results, mainly in mechanical properties. Nevertheless, recycled HIPS filaments are comparable to or better than commercial ones in some cases. As a result, recycled HIPS filaments hold the potential to be considered as an alternative to other types of 3D print filaments.

AB The introduction of 3D printing technology has revolutionised the manufacturing and electronic product design in the past few years, where it is used to even produce printed circuit boards. Printed electronics is one of the fastest-growing additive manufacturing technologies and is becoming invaluable to various industries. The evolution of several contact and non-contact types of fabrication techniques have been reported in the recent past. Leveraging these technologies, various types of printed electronic components have been realized. One method is inkjet printing technology, which has been widely accepted for printed electronics manufacturing. As 3D printing uses only those materials which are essential to create the product, it eliminates waste production, with a smaller equipment cost and minimizes the number of process steps, resulting in lower manufacturing costs with reduced turnaround time. Various kinds of conductive and non-conductive materials have emerged in the recent past in conjunction with many manufacturing techniques for printed electronics. Herein, we review the most commonly used substrates, electronic printing materials, and the widespread printing techniques employed at the industrial level, giving an overall vision for a better understanding and evaluation of their different features. The technical challenges of several contact and non-contact techniques with corresponding solutions are also presented. Finally, status on advances in the production of various kinds of materials employed in 3D printed electronics and the methods for producing them, shortcomings, technical challenges, applications, benefits, and the future opportunities pertaining to printed electronics are discussed in detail.

AB Concrete digital fabrication technology has been rapidly emerging while facing sustainability issues due to the high cement proportion in printed materials, rendering an environmentally friendly material design containing coarse aggregates one way for the concrete 3D printing industry to achieve more sustainable development. Here, 3D printed concrete with recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) was prepared, and its interlayer bonding properties were investigated considering different RCA replacement ratios, interlayer time intervals and layer heights. The results showed that RCA and the printing time interval degraded the interlayer bond strength, whereas no clear correlation was found with the layer height. Although the incorporation of RCA significantly changed the interlayer bonding system and cracking pattern, the interlayer bond strength of 3D printed recycled coarse aggregate concrete was substantially higher than that of 3D printed mortar. Finally, focusing on the pore structure characteristics, the mechanism influencing the interlayer bond performance is discussed.

AB 3D printing is a constantly expanding technology that represents one of the most exciting and disruptive production possibilities available today. This technology has gained global recognition and garnered considerable attention in recent years. However, technological breakthroughs, particularly in the field of material science, continue to be the focus of research, particularly in terms of future advancements. The 3D printing techniques are employed for the manufacturing of advanced multifunctional polymer composites due to their mass customization, freedom of design, capability to print complex 3D structures, and rapid prototyping. The advantages of 3D printing with multipurpose materials enable solutions in challenging locations such as outer space and extreme weather conditions where human involvement is not possible. Each year, numerous research papers are published on the subject of imbuing composites with various capabilities such as magnetic, sensing, thermal, embedded circuitry, self-healing, and conductive qualities by the use of innovative materials and printing technologies. This review article discusses the various 3D printing techniques used in the manufacture of polymer composites, the various types of reinforced polymer composites (fibers, nanomaterials, and particles reinforcements), the characterization of 3D printed parts, and their applications in a various industries. Additionally, this review discussed the limitations of 3D printing processes, which may assist future researchers in increasing the utility of their works and overcoming the shortcomings of previous works. Additionally, this paper discusses processing difficulties, anisotropic behavior, stimuli-responsive characteristics (shape memory and self-healing materials), CAD constraints, layer-by-layer appearance, and void formation in printed composites. Eventually, the promise of maturing technology is discussed, along with recommendations for research activities that are desperately required to realize the immense potential of operational 3D printing.

AB Developing recyclable biobased photopolymers for UV-curable 3D printing is of great significance for sustainable development of 3D printing industry. In this work, novel recyclable and reprintable castor oil (CO)-based photopolymers for digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing were developed via hindered urea bonds, a type of dissociating dynamic covalent bonds. Remarkably, the printed objects could be recycled in 4 h at 90 degrees C or 2 h at 100 degrees C without any catalysts or solvents, and the recycled resins had similar physiochemical properties, polymerization kinetics, and printing resolutions as the original resin. Furthermore, reprintable sacrificial molds and thermochromic materials were achieved with the optimal biobased resin, which can be used in complicated model casting and information encryption/anti-counterfeiting areas. In particular, thermochmmic microcapsules could be recycled nondestructively from the printed thermochmmic materials and reused in DLP 3D printing.

AB The use of recycled Carbon Fibers (rCFs) into polylactic acid (PLA) matrix to produce new reinforced 3D printing filaments was assessed. Filaments containing 5 and 10 wt% of rCFs were manufactured and, in order to compare the effect of the partial oxidized surface of recycled CFs on the adhesion with PLA matrix, filaments of pure PLA and with the same concentration of washed virgin Carbon Fibers (vCFs) were also produced. As expected the addition of CFs impacts the 3D printed thermal and mechanical properties, leading to the reduction of thermal expansion up to 85% and to a substantial increase of the storage modulus up to 7.1 GPa for PLA/vCF10. Furthermore this study underlines that the use of rCFs leads to a thermo-mechanical performance well comparable with that of the analogue virgin fibers based materials, supporting the suitability of recycled CFs for 3D printing applications. Indeed, when the fiber aspect ratio is not a crucial detrimental point, the quality of recycled CFs has now achieved performances that make them a better alternative to the pristine fibers, in particular when economic aspects are also taken into account.

AB In this study, a high-value-added recycled alpha-hemihydrate gypsum (alpha-RHG) generated from WGP using the atmospheric pressure hydrothermal method (APHM) was utilized to manufacture a 3D printed material. The univariate and combined effects of affordable and high-performance glidants, including hydrophobic nano-silica (HNS) and soluble starch (SS), on the flowability of alpha-RHG were evaluated experimentally and modelled. The results revealed that the flowability of alpha-RHG can be enhanced by the proper univariate addition of HNS (e.g., <1.0 wt%) or SS (e.g., <3.0 wt%). In addition, the experimental and modelling results based on central composite design (CCD) using response surface methodology have consistently demonstrated that the optimal flowability of alpha-RHG can be achieved by incorporating an optimum combined addition of 1.0 wt% HNS and 3.0 wt% SS. Finally, a 3D printed sample with a flow rate of 3.16 g/s using the modified alpha-RHG powder with optimum addition of HNS and SS was successfully produced.

AB This paper investigates the utilization of recycled brick powder (BP) as supplementary cementitious material to prepare low carbon 3D printing concrete (3DPC). The effect of grinding time on the characteristics of BP was first analyzed, then the effect of BP on the rheology, printability, mechanical properties, and pore structure of 3DPC was studied. Since the porous microstructure of BP particles is destroyed during grinding process, as the grinding time increases, the average particle size and BET specific surface area of BP decrease synchronously. The BP with larger average particle size and specific surface area worsens printing quality and brings to wider interface zone and higher porosity of 3DPC. However, the BP with small average particle size (27.4 mu m in this research) hardly affects the rheology and printability of 3DPC, and only slightly decreases the mechanical properties. This research can provide guidance for applying recycled BP to prepare low carbon 3DPC.

AB In this work, blends that were based on first use PP added with talc (PPt) and recycled polypropylene (r-PP) were designed and formulated, aiming at producing filaments that are suitable for 3D printing fused filament fabrication (FFF) processes. A preliminary characterization of PPt/r-PP blends at different weight ratios allowed selecting two systems showing adequate rheological behavior for FFF. The selected blends were melt compounded in a twin-screw extruder, optimizing the processing conditions through a design of experiments approach, involving the use of Taguchi's method. The materials that were prepared with the optimized processing conditions, hence showing the best performance in terms of rheological behavior and thermal characteristics, were then selected for the production of the filament and for the subsequent FFF processing. Finally, the morphology of the filament and the mechanical properties of 3D-printed samples were assessed, demonstrating the achievement of satisfactory results in terms of performances. In general, the obtained results clearly demonstrated that a proper optimization of both material and processing conditions offers the possibility of using recycled PP-based formulations for additive manufacturing processes, hence allowing a remarkable valorization of a low added-value material through its utilization for an innovative and sustainable manufacturing approach.

AB Recycled high-density polyethylene (r-HDPE) was combined with waste carbon fiber by loading 6 k, 12 k, and 24 k tows through an extruder to create thermoplastic/carbon pellets with fiber volume fractions of 11.2%, 18.9%, and 29.5%, respectively. Tensile and flexural coupons were subsequently produced via injection molding and novel 3D printing. The addition of carbon into r-HDPE in all cases showed increased mechanical properties. Maximum increases were observed through the inclusion of 29.5% fiber volume fraction. Increases in tensile and flexural modulus of up to 2.9 GPa (+505.9%) and 5.8 GPa (+711.0%) respectively were observed for r-HDPE/carbon fiber (CF) samples. Increases in tensile and flexural strengths of up to 57.9 MPa (+311.8%) and 47.7 MPa (+188.0%) respectively were observed for 29.5% r-HDPE/CF samples. Some variance in mechanical performance between injection molded and 3D printed samples was observed indicating production methodology might influence final material performance.

AB The disposal of personal protective equipment (PPE) is a main concern of researchers. In recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic made this issue worse, so the production and use of large quantities of disposable gloves in recent years and the lack of a suitable solution for the disposal of these recycled materials are some of the consequences of this pandemic. To address this issue, the present study performed a comprehensive experimental program to determine the possibility of using recycled latex and vinyl gloves as recycled fibers within extrusion-based 3D printing concrete. Moreover, a graphene oxide (GO) nanomaterial was also used to compensate for some undesired properties of mixtures. Flow table, buildability, and mechanical tests were performed in this study. Results show that the synergic effect of recycled fibers and GO significantly improved the 3D printing characteristics of mortar. Although very promising results were obtained in this study, findings show that using a high content of recycled fibers reduces the concrete compressive strength. However, the addition of GO significantly compensates for this reduction.

ID 3D; POLYMERS
AB Dynamic bond exchanging vitrimers have emerged recently due to their malleability, self-heal ability, recyclability, and mechanical stability. Likewise, 3D printing is consciously introduced at different platforms for ease of fabrication, high throughput, cost-effectiveness, and waste reduction. These two distinctive techniques have recently made their consensus performance, resulting from a phenomenal change in the printing field. Conventionally, thermoplastic inks have been primarily used in 3D printing, owing to their effortless processability. At the same time, thermosets were utilized for their superior mechanical strength. However, these two essential properties have been required to be presented in the printed material. In that scenario, thermoset vitrimer materials have been introduced in 3D printing, where malleability and mechanical stability have been observed in the same material. Thus, this article details the recent vitrimer material included with the different 3D printing system systems with their reported results to understand and make them widespread. Eventually, the outlook and perspectives could be helpful to understand and enhance this specific field.

AB 2,2,4,4-Tetramethyl-1,3-cyclobutanediol (TMCD) is a diol monomer for terephthalic acid (TPA) class of copo-lyesters that can increase the glass transition temperature and mechanical strength in comparison to conven-tional TPA polyesters. TMCD-modified poly (1,4-cyclohexylenedimethylene terephthalate) (PCTT) has been used to manufacture consumer products with good toughness, heat resistance and clarity. However, the suitability of PCTT in 3D printing had not been evaluated. Therefore, consumer plasticware was used as the starting material to investigate the suitability of this copolyester for fused deposition modeling (FDM). Chemical structure, me-chanical properties, thermal behavior and viscoelastic properties of this copolyester were studied. NMR spec-troscopy found that the copolyester had cyclohexanedimethanol (CHDM) and TMCD contents at 76.5 mol% and 20 mol% of total diol, respectively. 280 degrees C printing temperature and 110 degrees C bed temperature were suitable conditions for printing. Tg of PCTT was 103 degrees C (25 degrees C higher than PETG). Young's modulus and impact strength of printed PCTT were at least 100% and 65% higher than printed PETG, respectively. The ease of printing, superior mechanical properties and Tg (103 degrees C) make the PCTT random copolyester highly applicable in additive manufacturing.

AB This article presents a literature review on the use of cementitious materials for 3D printing applications in the context of environmental sustainability and the construction sector. In this study are presented materials currently used for 3D concrete printing. Structural and nonstructural applications are considered. New research regarding more durable and sustainable materials is discussed. Furthermore, recent contributions on the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the concrete 3D printing technology are summarized. A discussion on the current studies is conducted, and recommendations for the environmental performance improvement of printed concrete are produced. The review showed that there are few studies on the LCA of concrete for 3D printing and that the concrete employed for this purpose generally uses large volume fractions of Portland cement in order to achieve proper rheology. New studies, however, demonstrate that supplementary cementitious materials, recycled wastes, and alternative matrices can be applied to reduce life cycle environmental impacts. Studies also show that the environmental performance of the printed structures can be improved through functional hybridization, structural optimization, and increasing the energy efficiency of the printing systems.

AB 3D printing is an essential tool for rapid prototyping in a variety of sectors such as automotive and public health. The 3D printing market is booming, and it is projected that it will continue to thrive in the coming years. Unfortunately, this rapid growth has led to an alarming increase in the amount of 3D printed plastic waste. 3D printing processes such as stereolithography (SLA) and digital light projection (DLP) in particular generally produce petroleum-based thermosets that are further worsening the plastic pollution problem. To mitigate this 3D printed plastic waste, sustainable alternatives to current 3D printing materials must be developed. The present review provides a comprehensive overview of the sustainable advances in SLA/DLP 3D printing to date and offers a perspective on future directions to improve sustainability in this field. The entire life cycle of 3D printed parts has been assessed by considering the feedstock selection and the end-of-use of the material. The feedstock selection section details how renewable feedstocks (from lignocellulosic biomass, oils, and animal products) or waste feedstocks (e.g., waste cooking oil) have been used to develop SLA/DLP resins. The end-of-use section describes how materials can be reprocessed (e.g. thermoplastic materials or covalent adaptable networks) or degraded (through enzymatic or acid/base hydrolysis of sensitive linkages) after end-of-use. In addition, studies that have employed green chemistry principles in their resin synthesis and/or have shown their sustainable 3D printed parts to have mechanical properties comparable to commercial materials have been highlighted. This review also investigates how aspects of sustainability such as recycling for feedstock/end-of-use or biodegradation of 3D printed parts in natural environments can be incorporated as future research directions in SLA/DLP.

ID CONSTRUCTION; CONCRETE; POWDER; WASTE
AB 3D printing process poses great impacts on the properties of mortar, especially on the shrinkage behavior of 3D printed mortar (3DPM) prepared with recycled fine aggregate (RFA) and recycled powder (RP). This study focuses on the effects of printing paths on the flowability and the drying shrinkage of 3DPM. RFA and RP, together with their contents, are used as variables in 3DPM. The results show that the flow loss of mortar during the first 30 mins increased with the incorporation of recycled fines due to the high water-absorption of RFA and the low hydration reactivity of RP. The drying shrinkage development of 3DPM was higher than that of cast mortar during the first 28 days, but exhibited a deceleration in shrinkage increasing rate after 28 days. Printing path showed a limited effect on the mass loss of 3DPM during the test period, but had significant impacts on the drying shrinkage and the shrinkage development trend. An increase in drying shrinkage of 3DPM was caused by 50 100% RFA replacement (29.1 - 57.9% in 60 days), while 10 - 20% RP content decreased the drying shrinkage of 3DPM (3.3 - 12.4% in 60 days). Additionally, the incorporation of recycled fines delayed the development of 3DPM drying shrinkage.

AB An ever-growing amount of composite waste will be generated in the upcoming years. New circular strategies based on 3D printing technologies are emerging as potential solutions although 3D-printed products made of recycled composites may require post-processing. Metallization represents a viable way to foster their exploitation for new applications. This paper shows the use of physical vapor deposition sputtering for the metallization of recycled glass fiber-reinforced polymers processed by UV-assisted 3D printing. Different batches of 3D-printed samples were produced, post-processed, and coated with a chromium metallization layer to compare the results before and after the metallization process and to evaluate the quality of the finishing from a qualitative and quantitative point of view. The analysis was conducted by measuring the surface gloss and roughness, analyzing the coating morphology and thickness through the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) micrographs of the cross-sections, and assessing its adhesion with cross-cut tests. The metallization was successfully performed on the different 3D-printed samples, achieving a good homogeneity of the coating surface. Despite the influence of the staircase effect, these results may foster the investigation of new fields of application, as well as the use of different polymer-based composites from end-of-life products, i.e., carbon fiber-reinforced polymers.

AB The rapid increase in waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) poses a significant environmental challenge. To address this issue, initiatives promoting circular economy principles have emerged, such as utilizing recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABSr) and high-impact polystyrene (HIPSr) from WEEE. This study evaluated the properties of virgin ABS (ABSv)/ABSr and ABSv/HIPSr blends, with ABSr and HIPSr obtained from TV housing WEEE. The blend samples were prepared using filament extrusion, followed by either compression molding or 3D printing. ABSv exhibited a stronger shear-thinning behavior than ABSr and HIPSr at low shear rates, indicating a higher content of butadiene rubber. The viscosities of the blends increased with higher ABSv content at low shear rates and approximated those of ABSv, ABSr, and HIPSr at high shear rates. Overall, compression-molded blends demonstrated superior viscosities at low shear rates and higher impact strength compared to their 3D-printed counterparts.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, is a transformative production technology offering design freedom, material efficiency, and mass customization. However, its environmental sustainability remains a critical concern due to energy-intensive processes, limited recyclability of materials, and challenges in lifecycle impact assessment. This review presents a comprehensive analysis of sustainability challenges and innovations in AM, with a focus on material extrusion (MEX) and related polymer-based techniques. It explores the environmental performance of both virgin and recycled materials, the trade-offs between energy consumption and mechanical performance, and recent developments in biodegradable and bio-based polymers. The review also synthesizes findings from lifecycle assessments (LCAs), energy optimization experiments, and material circularity studies to provide an integrated framework for sustainable additive manufacturing. By bridging technological advances, material science, and sustainability metrics, this work highlights key strategies for aligning AM practices with circular economy principles. The review aims to guide researchers, engineers, and policymakers in understanding the current limitations and future directions of sustainable 3D printing.

AB Despite recent advances in 3D printing and additive manufacturing, the main materials in rapid prototyping are derived from finite resources such as petroleum-based plastics. Researchers are developing alternatives to exhaustible and potentially environmentally harmful materials through biomaterials. Mycelium biocomposites are one promising area of inquiry; when mycelium decomposes biomass, it produces a composite biomaterial, which is fully compostable and has beneficial structural and hydrophobic properties. However, mold-based fabrication methods for biocomposites require tooling and limit the possible shapes. We introduce a novel method for directly 3D printing mycelium biocomposites without the need for molds or tooling. Our method comprises three main contributions: Mycofluid, a mycelium-inoculated paste that uses spent coffee grounds, a recycled biomass; Fungibot, a custom hardware system for 3D printing biopastes like Mycofluid; and a method for incubating mycelial growth within fresh 3D prints resulting in mycelium biocomposite parts. We illustrate our contributions through a series of objects showcasing our method and the material qualities of the parts. Notably, we demonstrate how living mycelium can fuse separate prints, enabling complex geometries that are otherwise challenging to 3D print as one part.

AB 3D printing by fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an advanced additive manufacturing technology for making thermoplastic-based structures. Several studies have recently investigated 3D printing of poly lactic acid (PLA) with biomass resources like cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and whole biomass. Such biodegradable composites are better for the environment and can be used to replace non-biodegradable composites in a variety of applications. Therefore, a deep understanding of printing such biocomposites is needed for supporting such manufacturing. Recent developments focused on FDM printing of PLA filled with biomass resources have been critically reviewed to reveal the intricate aspects of manufacturing of such materials and characterization of the changes caused by biomass-based fillers. Properties of high molecular weight PLA, essentials of printing with PLA and conditions for filament extrusion and printing of biocomposites are discussed. Characterization results from mechanical testing, thermal analysis, viscoelastic properties, imaging and spectroscopy are reviewed for understanding the impact of filling biomass resources in PLA by printing. The latter sections discuss applications, upcycling & recycling and future opportunities for biorefineries. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB This study investigates the use of three different recycled powder sets for 3D printing biomedical components, addressing the growing need for sustainable manufacturing solutions. Despite the widespread use of virgin powder in additive manufacturing, there is limited research on the performance of reconditioned powders. This study fills that gap by analyzing the performance of virgin powder, reconditioned powder, a mixed powder containing 50% fresh and 50% 7-times recycled powder, and a 7-times recycled powder (C7-only). The powders were systematically sampled, sieved, and used to print test samples such as cubes and tensile bars. The chemical composition, powder size distribution, and flowability of the powders were examined and correlated with mechanical tensile tests and porosity levels in the printed parts. Results indicate that reconditioned powder exhibits superior flowability compared to the mixed or C7-only powders. Notably, the tensile strength and strain of parts made from C7-only and mixed powders surpassed those made from virgin powder, despite a slightly higher porosity in the recycled powder samples. This study highlights the potential advantages of using reconditioned powder in the additive manufacturing of biomedical components, offering a less costly and environmentally friendly alternative for producing sensitive medical parts.

AB Progressing plastics circularity and its associated benefits can provide advantages to both practitioners and the broader environment. As technology continues to evolve and various industries increasingly embrace the principles of the circular economy, additive manufacturing cannot remain detached. The widespread utilization of additive manufacturing can be a valuable asset for reprocessing recycled plastics, for reuse as secondary life products. This study investigates the reuse of Low-density PolyEthylene (LDPE) in additive manufacturing via a robust, customized, low-cost pellet extruder 3D printing system. The system underwent evaluation through mechanical tests of 3D printing specimens and Finite Element Analyses (FEA). Four mixtures were created using different fractions of neat and recycled LDPE and tensile specimens were fabricated and tested under quasi-static tests, according to ASTM D638. The corresponding FE materials models were developed to create a numerical tool for the evaluation of LDPE 3D printed components. The tensile strength tests showed that specimens developed with 100% recycled LDPE performed 70.06% better in elastic modulus, 18.18% better in ultimate tensile strength (UTS), and 17.74% better in yield strength compared to specimens consisting of 60% recycled and 40% virgin LDPE, which exhibited the best mechanical properties among the tested mixtures. However, they exhibited a 14.34% reduction in elongation at break. The outcomes of this study established a sustainable and fully functional proof-of-concept of the developed 3D printing system to address the reduction, reuse and recycling of plastic waste under the Sustainable Plastic Strategy.

AB This study investigates the printability of mortar containing recycled sand for 3D printing applications, addressing the increasing demand for sustainable construction materials. The main objective is to understand how the morphology and fineness modulus of sand, along with the water-to-binder (w/b) ratio, influence the rheological properties of the mortar. 30 different mixtures were analysed to assess their impact on static and dynamic yield stresses, offering insights into the key factors necessary for optimizing mixture designs in successful 3D printing processes. The analysis shows that the static yield stress is significantly influenced by the mixture's water-to-binder ratio, as well as the fineness modulus and morphology of the sand particles. However, for the dynamic yield stress, only the water-to-binder ratio in the mixture and the fineness modulus of the recycled sand have a significant impact, while the morphology has negligible influence. Multiple linear regression analyses reveal that higher fineness modulus and water-to-binder ratios generally lead to lower static and dynamic yield stresses, as well as a reduced degree of shear thinning. The findings suggest that incorporating recycled sand enhances shear thinning in 3D printing mortar, potentially improving the buildability of the mixtures.

AB The activation of zeolites into recycled polypropylene (r-PP) offers a transformative approach to upcycling plastic waste into sustainable composite materials for 3d printing and injection molding, addressing challenges in circular economic practices. This study focuses on the impact of varying zeolite concentrations (0 wt%, 2 wt%, 5 wt%, 10 wt%, 20 wt%, and 30 wt%) on material extrusion, filament quality, and mechanical and thermal properties in 3D-printed and injection-molded samples. Optimized extrusion parameters enabled the successful production of filaments, while optical and scanning electron microscopy revealed insights into inter-bead voids, debonding, fibre dispersion, fracture modes, and filament/sample quality. Differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis highlighted modest reductions in melting and crystallization temperatures attributed to slight matrix deterioration. The mechanical performance was evaluated through tensile and flexural testing. 3D-printed specimens exhibited peak tensile strength at 29.25 +/- 0.5 MPa and flexural strength at 39.21 +/- 0.5 MPa with 10 wt% zeolite, while injection-molded samples achieved superior tensile and flexural strengths of 34.29 +/- 0.5 MPa and 43.32 +/- 0.5 MPa, respectively. However, higher zeolite content (>= 20 wt%) resulted in agglomeration, void formation, and reduced mechanical integrity. The introduction of polypropylene tape as a bed layer successfully mitigated adhesion and warpage issues during 3d printing, improving print quality and structural integrity. This work introduces a novel approach by integrating zeolites as functional fillers into recycled PP, enabling diverse applications, including automotive, construction, and packaging industries. Furthermore, the use of zeolites contributes to surface quality enhancement, potential VOC suppression, and thermal stability improvements, aligning with circular economy principles. This research not only addresses key limitations of PP in additive manufacturing but also pioneers the upcycling of plastic waste into high-value, multifunctional composites, making it a significant advancement in sustainable polymer processing.

AB The additive manufacturing process creates objects directly by stacking layers of material on each other until the required product is obtained. The application of additive manufacturing technology for teaching and research purposes is still limited and unpopular in developing countries, due to costs and lack of accessibility. In this study, an extruding-based 3D printing additive manufacturing technology was employed to design and construct a low-cost-high-accessibility 3D printing machine to manufacture plastic objects. The machine was designed using SolidWorks 2020 version with a 10 x 10 x 10 cm(3) build volume. The fabrication was carried out using locally available materials, such as PVC pipes for the frame, plywood for the bed, and Zinc Oxide plaster for the bed surface. Repetier firmware was the operating environment for devices running on the computer operating system. Cura was used as the slicing software. The fabricated machine was tested, and the printer produced 3D components with desired structural dimensions. The fabricated 3D printer was used to manufacture some plastic objects using PLA filament. The recommended distance between the nozzle tip and the bed is 0.1 mm. The constructed 3D printer is affordable and accessible, especially in developing nations where 3D printing applications are limited and unpopular.

AB With the development of new technologies and the rise of 5G in China, top-level design has accelerated the new generation of infrastructure construction. 3D printing is a manufacturing technology with pronounced digital characteristics, and 3D printing has irreplaceable benefits compared with the traditional manufacturing industry. The technical principle of the 3D printing technology could be using adhesive materials, including powdery metal and plastic, to construct the object layer by layer based on the digital model files. This paper will introduce 3D printing technology in detail, including the process of 3D printing from the perspective of software application and several standard 3D printing technologies at present. This paper will also discuss both the application and the development of three-dimensional printing technology.

AB The demand for sustainable materials and technologies has risen due to the construction sector's substantial impact on the ecosystem, natural resources and human health. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the sustainability potential of recycled materials for the construction 3D printing (3DP) process. Mortar mixtures are designed using recycled binder materials (fly ash and blast furnace slag) and aggregate materials (waste concrete-based recycled fine aggregate (RFA)) for the 3D printing process. The adequacy of different geopolymer mixtures for the printing process is assessed through the open time, slump and spread diameter. The results showed that geopolymer mixtures containing RFA offered adequate fresh properties and more dimensional stability for the 3D printing process. The compression testing of the RFA-based geopolymers (along with different testing orientations) also yields better strength than the natural fine aggregate (NFA) in 3D printing. Apart from lab-scale experimentation, a case study of 3D printed and casted walls (using NFA and RFA based geopolymer mixtures) has been considered for comprehensive economic and life cycle analysis (LCA). The results showed that the 3D printed wall using RFA offered a lower burden on the ecosystem, natural resources, and human health; moreover, the lowest cost was observed in the case of the 3D printed wall containing RFA. The higher overall environmental and economic impact of casted wall was primarily due to the usage of plywood formwork. Sensitivity analysis showed that reusing formwork up to 10 times can potentially reduce economic and ecological burdens, depending on construction complexity, but still, traditional construction's overall burden remains higher than 3D printing. As 3D printing technology matures and economies of scale are realized, 3D printing is expected to reduce costs and environmental impacts further.

AB This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the rheological behaviour and pumpability of a mortar designed for 3D printing, incorporating fine recycled aggregates (recycled sand) sourced from construction and demolition waste. The research addresses the growing demand for sustainable construction materials by exploring the viability of recycled sand in 3D mortar printing applications. The study aims to modify a highly thixotropic reference mortar for 3D printing by substituting natural sand with recycled sand. Various aggregate-to-binder (a/b) ratios are used to assess their influence on the mortar's rheological properties and pumpability. The methodology extensively employs rheological oscillatory tests conducted with an Anton Paar MCR102e rheometer to obtain the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") evolution over time for each mixture. Additionally, oscillatory step tests are conducted to measure the degree of thixotropy exhibited by the mixtures. The findings of the Sliding Pipe Rheometer (SLIPER) are instrumental in characterizing the slip layer's rheological properties, providing essential insights into the pumpability of the mortar.

AB This research investigated the viability of utilizing recycled polyethylene terephthalate (RPET) derived from post-consumer PET soda bottles (RPET-SF) and PET water bottles (RPET-WF) as a 3D printing material. The physical and mechanical properties of RPET-SF and RPET-WF samples were examined across varying temperature conditions and compared with those of virgin PET (VPET) samples. The findings indicated that RPET-SF samples exhibited the lowest density, hardness, and average surface roughness values. However, tensile tests revealed that RPET-SF printed at 250 degrees C demonstrated the highest tensile strength (TS). Specifically, RPET-SF displayed a tensile modulus (E), yield strength (sigma y), and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 1250.8 +/- 70 MPa, 23.31 +/- 1.5 MPa, and 34.08 +/- 3 MPa, respectively. These values were 37.8%, 19.3%, and 56.62% higher than those of VPET samples. Additionally, RPET-SF printed at 260 degrees C exhibited the maximum flexural strength of 44.78 +/- 2.33 MPa. In conclusion, the obtained data suggest that recycled PET can be effectively employed as a 3D printing material, and this study provides valuable insights for achieving enhanced mechanical performance with recycled PET.

AB This study evaluates the combined roles of particle size and the addition of maleic anhydride polypropylene (PP-g-MAH) to improve 3D printing and mechanical properties of composite filaments based on recycled polypropylene (rPP) and rice husk (RH) obtained as a by-product of rice production. Particle size and PP-g-MAH content are shown to be critical in shaping the filaments' characteristics. Particle size below 250 microns and 5 wt.% of PP-g-MAH resulted in smoother surface finish, improved adhesion between RH particles and the rPP matrix, reduced crystallinity, and enhanced flow properties. Moreover, the study highlighted a significant reduction in the warping effect when RH and PP-g-MAH were incorporated, making the composite filaments more suitable for 3D printing applications. Besides, adding PP-g-MAH improved the printed parts' tensile and flexural properties, promising stronger and more sustainable 3D-printed products. This research contributes to developing eco-friendly 3D printing composite materials aligned with Circular Economy principles.

AB The integration of 3D printing into the manufacture of recycled structural color components presents a compelling alternative to conventional dyes and pigments. This paper proposes a processing strategy combining colloidal nanosphere self-assembly, twin-screw extrusion, and FDM 3D printing to rapidly produce noniridescent structural color components. The twin-screw extrusion mixes nanospheres with resin by using thermal shear forces to arrange nanospheres uniformly, creating structural color filaments (SCFs) for 3D printing. Using FDM 3D printing, various structural color patterns and three-dimensional structural color models (SCMs) are successfully fabricated. The results demonstrate that colloidal nanospheres can achieve regular arrangement within seconds under thermal shear, with the extruded filaments and printed models exhibiting pronounced noniridescent structural colors on a black substrate. Furthermore, SCFs and 3D-printed SCMs demonstrate excellent mechanical properties, with tensile strengths reaching 20.1 and 11.5 MPa, respectively. Moreover, this technology also features advantages such as material recyclability, low cost, low energy consumption, and flexibility in customization flexibility. These findings provide valuable insights into the integration of photonic crystals with 3D printing, underscoring the extensive application potential of noniridescent structural color materials in the production of complex patterns and functional components.

AB In recent years, with the European Green Deal and the Action Plan for the Circular Economy, Europe has relaunched the goal of pushing the construction sector towards a Circular Economy (CE). However, the construction sector is yet one of the most impactful. In order to activate circular strategies, 3D printing is a significant application with a view to creating sustainable materials for the construction sector. Starting from these considerations, the paper illustrates the experiences developed in two research projects, the MULTIFId project and the E-Adaptive project, about experimentation of facade cladding panels printed with additive technology. The research describes first the problems arising during production phase and their life-cycle impacts; then, how the reduction of criticalities and the better use of recycled materials can be supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI) softwares. With a view to implementing circular production strategies, the aim is to promote the use of sustainable building materials produced through 3D printing.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing is a digital manufacturing process and offers virtually limitless opportunities to develop structures/objects by tailoring material composition, processing conditions, and geometry technically at every point in an object. In this review, we present three different early adopted, however, widely used, polymer-based 3D printing processes; fused deposition modelling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), and stereolithography (SLA) to create polymeric parts. The main aim of this review is to offer a comparative overview by correlating polymer material-process-properties for three different 3D printing techniques. Moreover, the advanced material-process requirements towards 4D printing via these print methods taking an example of magneto-active polymers is covered. Overall, this review highlights different aspects of these printing methods and serves as a guide to select a suitable print material and 3D print technique for the targeted polymeric material-based applications and also discusses the implementation practices towards 4D printing of polymer-based systems with a current state-of-the-art approach.

AB Currently, 3D concrete printing attracts worldwide attention due to its digital-construction advantages, meanwhile, the problems of pollution caused by construction and demolition waste as well as the shortage of river sand become more and more serious. Based on it, this research tries to verify the printability of 3D printing mortar with 100% recycled sand by assessing its fluidity, extrudability, printability window, and green strength. Result shows that, when additional and suitable sodium gluconate is added into the printing mortar with 100% recycled sand, this mortar can not only meet the printability requirements of 3D printing, but also obtain a longer printability window and a higher green strength than the mortar with 100% natural sand, which is beneficial for the practical application of 3D concrete printing.

AB development of science and technology is undergoing speedy growth. And the construction should be also changed in the current digital transformation. Concrete 3D printing is a new technology in the construction industry. It contributes to modernization based on new and cut-edge characteristics. This new technology saves considerable labor as well as costs. Thus, the material used in concrete 3D printing plays an important role. Because concrete is a mixture of many components that meets the requirements of the concrete 3D building structure. Recycled PET resin and coir fibers are mixed into concrete to replace other aggregates in this study. The use of recycled and natural waste from various commodities in concrete 3D printing is an appealing and safe disposal strategy. The idea of using recycled PET resin and natural fibers as raw materials for concrete comes from the problem of environmental pollution. This method can reuse waste from PET resin and other resins with similar properties to it. That can solve the majority of the environmental issues created by recycled materials. In addition, using natural fibers is also a current trend to protect the environment. The material tests and experiments on concrete 3D printing buildings have been evaluated and showed good results.

AB Nowadays the use of natural fiber composites has gained significant interest due to their low density, high availability, and low cost. The present study explores the development of sustainable 3D printing filaments based on rice husk (RH), an agricultural residue, and recycled polypropylene (rPP) and the influence of fiber weight ratio on physical, thermal, mechanical, and morphological properties of 3D printing parts. Thermogravimetric analysis revealed that the composite's degradation process started earlier than for the neat rPP due to the lignocellulosic fiber components. Mechanical tests showed that tensile strength increased when using a raster angle of 0 degrees than specimens printed at 90 degrees, due to the weaker inter-layer bonding compared to in-layer. Furthermore, inter layer bonding tensile strength was similar for all tested materials. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images revealed the limited interaction between the untreated fiber and matrix, which led to reduced tensile properties. However, during the printing process, composites presented lower warping than printed neat rPP. Thus, 3D printable ecofriendly natural fiber composite filaments with low density and low cost can be developed and used for 3D printing applications, contributing to reduce the impact of plastic and agricultural waste.

AB This study explores the feasibility of utilizing recycled fine aggregates (RFA) in 3D mortar printing (3DMP) by evaluating the properties of 3D printing (3DP) mixtures with different contents of RFA (0%, 50%, and 100%) as well as sodium gluconate (0%, 0.6%, and 1.2%) before and after high-rate shearing from the perspective of rheology, failure pattern and buildability. The results showed that, the incorporation of RFA highly increased the 3DP mixture's initial value and time-varying rate of the static yield stress, viscosity and area of thixotropy hoop, while adding sodium gluconate decreased them respectively. Meanwhile, since high-rate shearing were found to highly decrease the mentioned rheological parameters of 3DP mixtures, a feeding system which can provide high-rate and continuous shearing was recommended in practical printing to prolong the open time of printing mixtures. Besides, a dimensionless buildability parameter lambda was proposed and defined as the ratio of accumulated offsets (whether compression or tension) to the theoretical height to describe the buildability of 3DP mixtures, which exhibited much higher accuracy than the maximum printing layer, maximum printing height and average vertical strain, respectively.

AB This paper studies the effects of recycled glass cullets as fine aggregates for the material in construction 3D printing. A reference material with natural river sand as fine aggregate was used as the control and recycled glass cullet of similar grading was used to replace the natural river sand at 25, 50,75 and 100% by mass. The effects of incorporating the recycled glass on the rheological properties such as the static yield stress, dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity were studied. 3D printing investigation was also con-ducted on the mixtures to evaluate the materials printability (pumpability and buildability). Mechanical properties such as compressive strength and interlayer bond strength by splitting tensile were also examined. Results show that the static yield stress decreases while the dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity increases as the recycled glass cullets content increases. The change in rheological properties also affected the printability of the mixtures. In the mechanical properties test, the increase in recycled glass cullets content also reduces the compressive strength and interlayer bond strength of the specimens.

AB Rapid population growth and accelerating urbanization are intensifying the demand for construction materials, particularly concrete, which is predominantly produced with Portland cement and natural aggregates. This reliance imposes substantial environmental burdens through resource depletion and greenhouse gas emissions. Within the framework of sustainable construction, recycled aggregates and industrial by-products such as fly ash, slags, crushed glass, and other secondary raw materials have emerged as viable substitutes in concrete production. At the same time, three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP) offers opportunities to optimize material use and minimize waste, yet it requires tailored mix designs with controlled rheological and mechanical performance. This review synthesizes current knowledge on the use of recycled construction and demolition waste, industrial by-products, and geopolymers in concrete mixtures for 3D printing applications. Particular attention is given to pozzolanic activity, particle size effects, mechanical strength, rheology, thermal conductivity, and fire resistance of recycled-based composites. The environmental assessment is considered through life-cycle analysis (LCA), emphasizing carbon footprint reduction strategies enabled by recycled constituents and low-clinker formulations. The analysis demonstrates that recycled-based 3D printable concretes can maintain or enhance structural performance while mix-level (cradle-to-gate, A1-A3) LCAs of printable mixes report CO2 reductions typically in the range of similar to 20-50% depending on clinker substitution and recycled constituents-with up to similar to 48% for fine recycled aggregates when accompanied by cement reduction and up to similar to 62% for mixes with recycled concrete powder, subject to preserved printability. This work highlights both opportunities and challenges, outlining pathways for advancing durable, energy-efficient, and environmentally responsible 3D-printed construction materials.

AB Three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP), an innovative fabrication technique, has emerged as an environmentally friendly digital manufacturing process for using recycled waste materials in the construction industry. The aim of this review paper is to critically evaluate the current state of research on the use of recycled materials such as aggregates and powders in 3DCP, correlating the environmental, economic, and performance parameter effects. This review comprehensively evaluates the potential benefits of incorporating recycled waste materials in 3D printing by critically reviewing the existing peer-reviewed articles through a scientometric review. The resulting bibliometric analysis identified 73 relevant papers published between 2018 and 2024. Through the critical review, five main research categories were identified: recycled materials in 3DCP arising mainly from construction demolition in powder and aggregate forms, which investigates the types of recycled materials used, their extraction methods, morphology and physical and chemical properties. The morphology properties of the materials used displayed high irregularities in terms of shape and percentage of adhered mortar. In the second category, printability and performance, the buildability, rheological properties and the mechanical performance of 3DCP with recycled materials were investigated. Category 3 assessed the latest developments in terms of 3D-printed techniques, including Neural Networks, in predicting performance. Category 4 analysed the environmental and economic impact of 3DCP. The results indicated anisotropic behaviour for the printed samples influencing mechanical performance, with the parallel printing direction showing improved performance. The environmental performance findings indicated higher global warming potential when comparing 3DCP to cast-in situ methods. This impact was reduced by 2.47% when recycled aggregates and binder replacements other than cement were used (fly ash, ground slag, etc.). The photochemical pollution impact of 3DPC was found to be less than that of cast-in situ, 0.16 to 0.18 C2H4-eq. This environmental impact category was further reduced up to 0.10 C2H4-eq following 100% replacement. Lastly, category 5 explored some of the challenges and barriers for the implementation of 3DCP with recycled materials. The findings highlighted the main issues, namely inconsistency in material properties, which can lead to a lack of regulation in the industry.

AB The introduction of new materials is tied to the rapid development of manufacturing processes. Additive manufacturing (AM) has been employed to fabricate a solid three-dimensional (3D) part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) data. AM is an industrial process that has been widely employed in different industries in the past few years. In fact, this 3D printing is a rapid prototyping technology that involves a series of techniques. Although several challenges and limitations exist in the AM process currently, AM is expected to revolutionize the manufacturing process of engineering components. However, despite the numerous applications of AM techniques in various industries, their environmental impacts are not well documented. AM affords significant changes in production cost, energy consumption, and manufacturing lead times. All these issues have been considered to develop this technology to have higher efficiencies and lower environmental impacts. In this paper, we briefly review AM methods and discuss their environmental impacts. Furthermore, we present the main advantages and disadvantages of AM processes involving polymers. It can be concluded that AM is advantageous in some cases, exhibiting lower energy consumption and comprising shorter manufacturing processes. The analysis and discussion indicate the advantages, limitations, and future research directions for the industrial applications of AM. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 3D printing, also called additive manufacturing (AM), is a method of creating 3D solid parts from a digital document. By utilizing additive routes, the fabrication of 3D-printed objects can be made. These layers can be viewed as a gently cut level cross-area of the manifest object. 3D printing is somewhat in obstruction to subtractive manufacture, which is expelling/discharging out a touch of metal or plastic for the occurrence of a milling machine. 3D printing authorizes creating multifarious profiles employing fewer materials than conventional fabrication systems. This review article provides the general idea of 3D printing production techniques, materials used, and applications in the aircraft and automobile industry and biomedical fields.

AB Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) is the most common 3D printing technology. An object formed through continuous layering until completion is known as an additive process while other processes with different methods are also relevant. In this paper, mechanical properties were analysed using two distinct kinds of printed polyethylene terephthalate (PET) as tensile test specimens. The materials used consist of recycled PET and virgin PET. An assessment of all the forty test pieces of both kinds of PET was undertaken. A comparison of the test samples' tensile strength values, difference in stress-strain curves, and elongation at break was also carried out. The reasoning behind the fracturing of test pieces that printed with different settings is presented in part by the depiction of the fractured specimens following the tensile test. An optimal route was revealed to be 3D printing with recycled PET, as per the mechanical testing. The hardness of the recycled filament decreased to 6%, while the tensile strength and shear strength increased to 14.7 and 2.8%, respectively. Nonetheless, no changes occurred to the tensile modulus elasticity. Despite notable differences being observed in the results of the recycled PET filament, no substantial differences were found prior or post-recycling in the mechanical properties of the PET filament. In conclusion, the demand for improved recycled 3D printing filament technologies is heightened due to the comparable mechanical features of the specimens of both the 3D printed recycled and virgin materials. With tensile strength figures reaching as high as 43.15MPa at Recycled PET and 3.12% being the greatest elongation at 40% Recycled PET, 100% Recycled is the ideal printing setting.

DE DLP reprinting; linear polymer; material recycling
AB 3D printing is becoming a disruptive technology and shows great potential for various practical applications. Specially, digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing demonstrates advantages in high resolution and high efficiency. However, extensive production of infusible and insoluble thermosets in DLP printing causes serious resource waste and environmental problems after its disposal. Herein, a reprintable linear polymer is reported for repeatable DLP printing. Taking advantage of the dissolution of linear polymer in its monomer, printed objects can be recycled into liquid resin and reprinted via the same DLP. Polymerization kinetics and printing resolution of recycled resins and mechanical properties of reprinted polymers retain identical as the original. The thermoplastic nature of linear polymer endows 3D objects with welding and reshaping property. Recyclable composites are also successfully fabricated, and sustainable usage of high-value fillers comes true. This strategy helps to address environmental issues arising from unprocessable thermosets and may contribute to an efficient materials recycling.

ID MECHANICAL-BEHAVIOR; CONSTRUCTION; PERFORMANCE; FABRICATION; DESIGN
AB 3d printing of cementitious material is a relatively new additive manufacturing process whose growing interest and fast development is mainly due to the digitalised manufacturing, allowing the disposition of material where it pleases. Yet, due to the properties of the fresh material and the difficulty to generate paths for the robots, the printed geometries have remained simple. In this regard, this papers longs to broaden the range of printable shapes by proposing a process-aware exploration of the 3d printing design space.
   This is done by looking at historic strategies that have been developed to build cantilevers, vaults and domes in masonry - a more ancient additive manufacturing process. Similarities and main differences between the two processes are pointed out, at the scale of the component, the layer and the global structure. From that a classification of masonry strategies to build cantilevers is proposed, facilitating the identification of parameters for 3d printing that will allow to reproduce such structures. Later, some guidelines for the design of printable geometries and the generation of robotic toolpaths are given, in the light of previous findings.

AB Recent advances in multi-material 3D and 4D printing (time as the fourth dimension) show that the technology has the potential to extend the design space beyond complex geometries. The potential of these additive manufacturing (AM) technologies allows for functional inclusion in a low-cost single-step manufacturing process. Different composite materials and various AM technologies can be used and combined to create customized multi-functional objects to suit many needs. In this work, several types of 3D and 4D printing technologies are compared and the advantages and disadvantages of each technology are discussed. The various features and applications of 3D and 4D printing technologies used in the fabrication of multi-material objects are reviewed. Finally, new avenues for the development of multi-material 3D and 4D printed objects are proposed, which reflect the current deficiencies and future opportunities for inclusion by AM.

DE Removable embedded 3D printing; Silicone 3D printing; Ultra-soft 3D
   printing; Ultra-low stiffness silicone; Additive manufacturing
AB Embedded 3D printing processes involve extruding ink within a support matrix that supports the ink throughout printing and curing. In one class of embedded 3D printing, which we refer to as "removable embedded 3D printing," curable inks are printed, cured, then removed from the uncured support matrix. Removable embedded 3D printing is advantageous because low-viscosity inks can be patterned in freeform geometries which may not be feasible to create via casting and other printing processes. When printing solid-infill geometries, however, uncured support matrix becomes trapped within the prints, which may be undesirable. This study builds on previous work by formulating a support matrix for removable embedded 3D printing that cures when mixed with the printed silicone ink to solve the problem of trapped, uncured support matrix within solid-infill prints. Printed specimens are shown to have a nearly isotropic elastic modulus in directions perpendicular and parallel to the printed layers, and a decreased modulus and increased elongation at break compared to specimens cast from the ink. The rheological properties of the support matrix are reported. The capabilities of the printer and support matrix are demonstrated by printing a variety of geometries from four UV and addition-cure silicone inks. Shapes printed with these inks range by nearly two orders of magnitude in stiffness and have failure strains between approximately 50% and 250%, suggesting a wide range of potential applications for this printing process.

AB The potential application of 3D printing technology is envisioned to create a third industrial revolution creating disruption in the economy, providing personalization and adaptation of the design. The construction field is quickly catching up with this new technology using the aid of a concrete 3D printer, the development of which is aimed at providing safer working conditions, economy and architectural freedom. The process of extrusion-based concrete printing requires the printable mix to flow through the distribution network and be deposited layer-by-layer on the build substrate or directly on-site analogous to the ink-jet printing process. In this case, for the mix to be printable, it should be capable of being pumped, extruded and deposited in layers within an optimized duration of time. The printing time-gap between layers is complicated by the scale and complexity of the geometry. The rheological behavior of the fresh mix will have a significant influence on the ability of the mix to be pumped and extruded while the mechanical response of the fresh concrete will influence the ability of the concrete printer to build layers with bonded interfaces. The design mixes are formulated to provide the maximum compressive and tensile strengths to the printed specimen which are influenced by the print parameters like time gap between layers, size of the nozzle in relation to the aggregate size. This paper aims at reviewing the concrete-mixes including fiber-reinforced, Geopolymer mixes suitable for the 3D printing process looking at both the fresh and hardened properties of the mix while simultaneously shedding light on appropriate printing parameters. The strategies used by researchers, in selecting appropriate material mix to tune the fresh properties of concrete and to improve the interfacial bond strength are discussed. Recommendations are provided to improve the quality of 3D printing process. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB Additive manufacturing has been of increasing interest to the construction industry for the last ten years. The subject of the research is the printing of concrete, metals, and plastics. In their analysis and research, authors have focused on printing plastics. 3D printing of reinforcement of concrete elements made of plastics can significantly improve the efficiency of their erection, reduce the amount of waste, and optimize their shape. In this paper, recent developments in the 3D printing of plastics for construction are reviewed. Various applications were discussed, including unconventional spatial reinforcement (impossible to achieve in a traditional way), printed permanent formwork, etc. The challenges for further research and practical applications of such solutions were also discussed.

AB Despite the growing global interest in 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced polymers, most of the applications are still limited to high-performance sectors due to the low effectiveness-cost ratio of virgin carbon fibers. However, the use of recycled carbon fibers in 3D printing is almost unexplored, especially for thermoset-based composites. This paper aims to demonstrate the feasibility of recycled carbon fibers 3D printing via UV-assisted direct ink writing. Pyrolyzed recycled carbon fibers with a sizing treatment were firstly shredded to be used as a reinforcement of a thermally and photo-curable acrylic resin. UV-differential scanning calorimetry analyses were then performed to define the material crosslinking of the 3D printable ink. Because of the poor UV reactivity of the resin loaded with carbon fibers, a rheology modifier was added to guarantee shape retention after 3D printing. Thanks to a customized 3D printer based on a commercial apparatus, a batch of specimens was successfully 3D printed. According to the tensile tests and Scanning Electron Microscopy analysis, the material shows good mechanical properties and the absence of layer marks related to the 3D printing. These results will, therefore, pave the way for the use of 3D printed recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymers in new fields of application.

AB Fiber-reinforced thermosets composites are widely used in engineering fields, but it is difficult to be customized for objects with complex shapes. Photo-curing 3D printing technique can achieve high precision and customization for polymer composites preparation. Herein, we demonstrate a simple and convenient strategy to manufacture biocomposites from micro-scale bamboo fibers (MBFs) and a vinyl palm oil-based resins via photocuring 3D printing. To improve the dispersion and stability of MBFs in the inks and the interfacial adhesion between fibers and matrix, the MBFs were modified with methacrylic anhydride to endow the fibers with C=C bonds. The modified MBFs could participate in the crosslinking of the bio-based matrix, thus greatly enhancing the mechanical strength and modulus as well as glass transition temperatures of the composites. More importantly, the matrix of the printed bio-based composites can be degraded in a mild condition, which is conducive to the recycle and utilization of fibers.

AB The world and science are moving forward nonstop. Every day, we see novel technologies that are coming to improve life quality. One of them is 3D printing or additive manufacturing. This technology covers the shortage of the current manufacturing technologies, and it has been enhanced by introducing smart materials like smart polymers as feed. The following product can adapt to circumstance conditions such as temperature changes, compression alteration, etc. These responses resulted in an advanced 3D printing technology called 4D printing. 3D and 4D printing technologies found their applications in all areas and industry sizes, from home-scale to large-scale industries. Regardless of all advantages of these technologies, there are still some shortages like low printing speed. But this never stops their progression and promotion. In this review, we aimed to cover general knowledge about 3D and 4D printing and their recent applications in various fields.

AB The present work focuses on studying and demonstrating the potential benefits of non-planar printing, as compared to conventional 3D printing, in terms of improved eco-impacts. To this end, a case study of a medical or ergonomic device, which may benefit from non-planar printing in different ways, is completely developed and manufactured employing alternative approaches, which are quantified, as regards production costs and environmental impacts. Three 3D printing processes are used: two of them relying on non-planar printing, one using conventional 2D printing trajectories. Relevant benefits are achieved thanks to the possibility, enabled by non-planar 3D printing, of manufacturing products upon reusable rapid tools. These support tools constitute an interesting alternative to the support meshes generally employed in additive manufacturing, which are normally a relevant source of waste and involve costly post-processes.

AB This paper is focused on the preparation of novel hybrid polymer composite materials for 3D filaments. As the reinforcing filler, expanded graphite, carbon fibers, and combinations thereof were used in various ratios up to 10%. The mechanical and thermal properties of virgin and recycled polyethylene phthalate glycol-modified (PETG) composite materials were determined. Almost all prepared composite materials were suitable for 3D printing and they have enhanced mechanical properties compared to the neat PETG matrices. Addition of the fillers to both polymer matrices has an only slight effect on the thermal stability, but the addition of carbon fibers significantly reduced the thermal expansion coefficient. The composites from cheaper recycled PETG have comparable properties to virgin PETG composites, which is of economic and ecological importance. New and cheaper materials can help expand 3D printing to manufacturing plants and the use of 3D printers for special applications.

AB Various requirements for 3D printing raised by actual applications in different fields have provoked the rapid development of technologies together with various specific materials. A protocol combining 3D printing with surface modification has stood out recently due to its outstanding capabilities to meet requirements in fields where surface properties are critical, allowing the surface performances of 3D-printed architectures to be controlled. So-called surface-functionalized 3D printing,viaadding a new functional dimension to the surface of 3D-printed objects, is believed to be a robust, time-saving, cost-effective, and highly desirable approach for 3D printing, meeting a variety of demands, compared to developing special-purpose materials for each solo case. The general strategy and methods, including etching, deposition processing, micro-/nano-composition coating, and polymer brush assisted surface modification, are summarized in this review, as are the various applications and feasibilities for use in biomedicine, engineering, flexible electronics, smart devices, and so forth, due to the acquired features originating from postprocessing, including wettability, biocompatibility and bioactivity, high strength and conductivity,etc.

AB Unprecedented levels of production and consumption has led to solid waste accumulation in landfills and oceans. Two significant landfill constituents are textile waste and discarded plastic bottles. Since there is a finite amount of space available for landfill use, solutions that reuse these post-consumer products are imperative. The work presented here is a methodology for producing natural fiber-reinforced polymer composites (NFRPCs) from pseudo-raw materials. Post-consumer textile waste and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) water bottles were made compatible by way of surface modifications. Melt compounding was used to form a monofilament feedstock for extrusion-based 3D printing platforms. Hydrolysis and functionalization of cellulose fibers from white denim cloth was performed. It was found that adding recycled textile fibers to the recycled PET matrix had a toughening effect. Materials characterization involving dynamic mechanical analysis, attenuated total reflectance, impact testing, melt flow index, and scanning electron microscopy were carried out to verify the efficacy of the functionalization process and to ascertain the robustness of the filler/matrix interface. The outcome is a demonstration of a feasible method for the repurposing of waste products for 3D printing applications.

AB This research work focuses on the utilization of waste ocean plastics with waste agro-industrial pyrolyzed biomass to develop complex shaped value-added prototypes through additive manufacturing. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF)-based three-dimensional (3D) printing of recycled HDPE/PP blends was challenging due to significant warpage-related problems during printing. Reinforcing these blend plastics with fillers played a significant role in the efficient 3D printing of complex-shaped objects. In this research, a blend of these recycled HDPE (70%) (rHDPE) and recycled PP (30%) (rPP) collected from the ocean shores was reinforced with pyrolyzed soy hulls-based biocarbon (20%) to fabricate filaments employed for developing specimens through injection molding as well as FFF-based 3D printing. The design of experiments (DOE) using Taguchi method was performed to determine the optimized 3D printing parameters to obtain the defect-free printed specimens. The results suggested that the injection-molded samples showed better mechanical properties as compared with 3D printed samples. However, an improvement (34%) in Young's modulus of the 3D printed rHDPE/rPP (70/30) blend was observed in comparison with injection-molded counterparts. The 3D printed rHDPE/rPP/20% Bio-carbon composite showed an improvement of similar to 11 and similar to 15% in Young modulus and flex modulus, respectively as compared to rHDPE/rPP. Combining ocean plastics and agro-industrial wastes could generate value-added products that would contribute to the circular economy approach for sustainable product development for different applications such as prototyping and automotive, while helping to protect ocean marine life. Two prototypes, elliptical gears with shaft and spectacle frame, have also been developed by using sustainable recycled HDPE/PP-based composites.

AB From full-color objects to functional capacitive artifacts, 3D printing multi-materials became essential to broaden the application areas of digital fabrication. We present Programmable Filament, a novel technique that enables multi-material printing using a commodity FDM 3D printer, requiring no hardware upgrades. Our technique builds upon an existing printing technique in which multiple filament segments are printed and spliced into a single threaded filament. We propose an end-to-end pipeline for 3D printing an object in multi-materials, with an introduction of the design systems for end-users. Optimized for low-cost, single-nozzle FDM 3D printers, the system is built upon our computational analysis and experiments to enhance its validity over various printers and materials to design and produce a programmable filament. Finally, we discuss application examples and speculate the future with its potential, such as custom filament manufacturing on-demand.

AB In this study, 3D printing filaments using recycled polypropylene (rPP) were produced by a single screw extruder. Graphene composite filament was also prepared using electrochemically exfoliated graphene (EEG) as a composite filler by adding 10, and 20 wt% of EEG to rPP. The graphene and rPP were successfully dispersed with great homogeneity, so that 3D filaments were uniformly produced, and their thermal properties increased as the graphene content increased. The mechanical property was also improved when EEG was 10 wt% but decreased when EEG was 20 wt% compared to that of rPP. 3D structures were successfully manufactured using prepared 3D filaments by a conventional 3D printer, and great advantages can be expected in terms of environmental and economical perspective by adopting plastic waste.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most widely used 3D printing techniques that utilizes polymers to create models, prototypes or even end products. Since 2009, the demand for FDM has been increasing at an incredible rate from one year to the next, and many experts believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize manufacturing in many sectors. The main advantages of FDM technology are that the technique offers a simpler fabrication process and a more cost-effective method compared to other prominent 3D printing techniques, and yet, it is still capable of manufacturing complex geometries and cavities with reasonable dimensional accuracy. However, there are still some limitations and shortcomings that have been identified, especially pertaining to the lower mechanical properties exhibited in FDM parts compared to the parts produced by conventional methods such as injection and compression techniques. Therefore, this review article focused on recent developments and progress in the FDM technique in an attempt to improve the end performance of 3D-printed parts, along with current challenges and the future direction.

AB In this study, recycled polymer feedstocks (high-density polyethylene, HDPE and polypropylene, PP) were added with different percentages of activated carbon (AC) made from coconut fiber waste - 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8%. The melting temperatures of the recycled HDPE and HDPE/PP filaments were 113 and 170 degrees C, respectively. The addition of AC improved the thermal stability of the recycled filaments up to 28% while decreased the crystallinity of the filament produced, resulting in a more uniform surface with less crazing. Incompatibility of the recycled HDPE and AC was observed. However, the presence of PP greatly enhanced the compatibility of AC with the HDPE polymer. With the addition of 8% AC to the recycled HDPE/PP, the elongation at break of the recycled HDPE/PP filament reached 54.2%, about 10 times higher than that without AC, which could be due to the passive local interfacial bonding of AC with the methyl group of the PP matrix. The improved elongation at break would in turn aid in 3D printing of products with better elasticity.

AB 3D concrete printing (3DCP) has received worldwide attention in recent years. However, very limited studies have been carried out on the simultaneous research and mutual coordination of printing system, process design and printing material. In this study, a printing system including supporting subsystem, controlling subsystem, feeding subsystem, and extruding subsystem was developed by considering the properties of mortar and the large-size characteristics of 3D mortar printing (3DMP). The process design of 3DMP, such as tool path and printing parameters, was also redesigned to improve the printing qualities. The properties of printing mortars with/without recycled sand were then comparatively studied, followed by a successful on-site printing of a 2.5 m x 2.5 m x 3 m room. Results have shown that replacing natural sand with 25% of recycled sand caused higher green strength and no obvious decrease in hardened mechanical properties. By properly adjusting printing parameters, the printing mortars (with or without recycled sand) can be well-matched with the printing system. This verifies the practicability of the developed printing system as well as the method of partial application of recycled sand in 3DMP. Besides, it is recommended that both real-time monitoring system and continuous printing are necessary to achieve higher printing quality and efficiency.

AB 3D printing (3DP) has transformed engineering, manufacturing, and the use of advanced materials due to its ability to produce objects from a variety of materials, ranging from soft polymers to rigid ceramics. 3DP offers the advantage of being able to print at a variety of lengths scales; from a few micrometers to many meters. 3DP has the unique ability to produce customized small lots, efficiently. Yet, one crucial industry that has not been able to adequately explore its potential is textile manufacturing. The research in 3DP of textiles has lagged behind other areas primarily due to the difficulty in obtaining some of the unique characteristics of strength, flexibility, etc., of textiles, utilizing a fundamentally different manufacturing technology. Textiles are their own class of materials due to the specific structural developments that occur during the various stages of textile manufacturing: from fiber extrusion to assembly of the fibers to fabrics. Here, the current 3DP technologies are reviewed with emphasis on soft and anisotropic structures, as well as the efforts toward 3DP of textiles. Finally, a potential pathway to 3DP of textiles, dubbed as printing with fibers to create textile structures is proposed for further exploration.

AB The Large Particle 3D Concrete Printing (LP3DCP) process presented in this paper is based on the particle bed 3D printing method; here, the integration of significantly larger particles (up to 36 mm) for selective binding using the shotcrete technique is presented. In the LP3DCP process, the integration of large particles, i.e., naturally coarse, crushed or recycled aggregates, reduces the cement volume fraction by more than 50% compared to structures conventionally printed with mortar. Hence, with LP3DCP, the global warming potential, the acidification potential and the total non-renewable primary energy of 3D printed structures can be reduced by approximately 30%. Additionally, the increased proportion of aggregates enables higher compressive strengths than without the coarse aggregates, ranging up to 65 MPa. This article presents fundamental material investigations on particle packing and matrix penetration as well as compressive strength tests and geometry studies. The results of this systematic investigation are presented, and the best set is applied to produce a large-scale demonstrator of one cubic meter of size and complex geometry. Moreover, the demonstrator features reinforcement and subtractive surface processing strategies. Further improvements of the LP3DCP technology as well as construction applications and architectural design potentials are discussed thereafter.

AB Objectives. Additive manufacturing, which is more colloquially referred to as 3D printing, is quickly approaching mainstream adoption as a highly flexible processing technique that can be applied to plastic, metal, ceramic, concrete and other building materials. However, taking advantage of the tremendous versatility associated with in situ photopolymerization as well as the ability to select from a variety of preformed processible polymers, 3D printing predominantly targets the production of polymeric parts and models. The goal of this review is to connect the various additive manufacturing techniques with the monomeric and polymeric materials they use while highlighting emerging material-based developments.
   Methods. Modern additive manufacturing technology was introduced approximately three decades ago but this review compiles recent peer-reviewed literature reports to demonstrate the evolution underway with respect to the various building techniques that differ significantly in approach as well as the new variations in polymer-based materials being employed.
   Results. Recent growth of 3D printing has been dramatic and the ability of the various platform technologies to expand from rapid production prototypic models to the greater volume of readily customizable production of working parts is critical for continued high growth rates. This transition to working part production is highly dependent on adapting materials that deliver not only the requisite design accuracy but also the physical and mechanical properties necessary for the application.
   Significance. With the weighty distinction of being called the next industrial revolution, 3D printing technologies is already altering many industrial and academic operations including changing models for future healthcare delivery in medicine and dentistry.

AB Silica examines the making of 3D printed tiles from recycled container glass. This paper describes an interdisciplinary exploration into how robot-controlled extrusion can offer new material practices by which to fabricate glass elements of an architectural scale. We pursue working with recycled container glass powder a waste product derived from the reprocessing of recycled container glass - to contribute to circular development within an interdisciplinary artistic development context in the meeting between architecture and glass design. The project has two aims. On the one hand, it builds an in-depth understanding of the parameters of fabrication and devising means by which to control these through digital design methods and their interfacing with robotic fabrication processes. On the other hand, it critically questions the architectural, aesthetic and performative properties of these material practices and their embedded methods.

AB Layer-by-layer deposition of materials to manufacture parts-better known as three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing-has been flourishing as a fabrication process in the past several years and now can create complex geometries for use as models, assembly fixtures, and production molds. Increasing interest has focused on the use of this technology for direct manufacturing of production parts; however, it remains generally limited to single-material fabrication, which can limit the end-use functionality of the fabricated structures. The next generation of 3D printing will entail not only the integration of dissimilar materials but the embedding of active components in order to deliver functionality that was not possible previously. Examples could include arbitrarily shaped electronics with integrated microfluidic thermal management and intelligent prostheses custom-fit to the anatomy of a specific patient. We review the state of the art in multiprocess (or hybrid) 3D printing, in which complementary processes, both novel and traditional, are combined to advance the future of manufacturing.

AB The rapid growth of textile industry and fast-fashion has led to the production of about 92 million ton of textile waste per year. Nearly 85% of textile waste is disposed of by landfill and incineration, causing serious environmental pollution and huge resource waste, calling for alternative textile production. Here we review the green production of textiles with focus on additive manufacturing, 3- and 4-dimension printing, recycling textile waste, and synthetic and natural fibers. Additive manufacturing technologies, particularly 4-dimension printing, is flexible, green, and allows on-demand manufacturing, which is one solution to the textile waste problem. 4-Dimension printing contributes to the development of intelligent materials, and can create structures that deform in response to external stimuli. Textile waste contains high-quality, low-cost materials that can be re-used and recycled. Applications include smart textiles, flexible electronics, soft robotics, human-computer interaction, and wearable devices.

AB Recycled tire rubber is an environmentally and economically beneficial material. Ground tire rubber (GTR) as a filler in a polymer matrix was used as an ink material (composite material) for material extrusion in a 3D printing process. The maximum allowable amount of GTR incorporated into the mixture without significantly altering the rheological behavior of the ink was set. Printability investigations revealed that pressure and speed show linear and power relationships, respectively, to the line width for three different amounts of GTR. Moreover, the post-curing time of 30 min at 115 degrees C was set as the full-cure condition to achieve polymerization of 80% or more for the 3D printed parts. Unidirectional tensile testing demonstrated that 3D printed specimens exhibit no degradation in tensile strength when compared to molded specimens. Moreover, printability and mechanical properties of functionalized GTR were investigated to determine if this material exhibits enhanced mechanical strength. Unidirectional tensile tests show that the maximum tensile strength for specimens with functionalized GTR was 20% higher than in specimens with non-functionalized GTR. In conclusion, 3D printing of GTR composites shows promise for using recycled GTR to create 3D structures with rubber-like properties.

AB In the present paper a new additive manufacturing processing route is introduced for ultra-high performance concrete. Interdisciplinary work involving materials science, computation, robotics, architecture and design resulted in the development of an innovative way of 3D printing cementitious materials. The 3D printing process involved is based on a FDM-like technique, in the sense that a material is deposited layer by layer through an extrusion printhead mounted on a 6-axis robotic arm. The mechanical properties of 3D printed materials are assessed. The proposed technology succeeds in solving many of the problems that can be found in the literature. Most notably, this process allows the production of 3D large-scale complex geometries, without the use of temporary supports, as opposed to 2.5D examples found in the literature for concrete 3D printing. Architectural cases of application are used as examples in order to demonstrate the potentialities of the technology. Two structural elements were produced and constitute some of the largest 3D printed concrete parts available until now. Multifunctionality was enabled for both structural elements by taking advantage of the complex geometry which can be achieved using our technology for large-scale additive manufacturing.

DE 3D printer filament; ELECTRE; Materials selection; Plastic recycling
AB The demand for a novel and sustainable alternative materials for 3D printer filaments has been knowingly increasing. One alternative source for the filament is to reuse and recycle post-consumer plastic products, which is also a compelling approach to conserve energy and sustain the environment. Thus, this study is focused on the materials selection of virgin polymer resins and recycled post-consumer plastics for use in 3D printer filaments. A multi-criteria decision method of Elimination and Choice Expressing the Reality (ELECTRE) was utilized to determine the best materials for 3D printer filaments. The study has shown that the virgin low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are optimal materials as an alternative filament among other options such as virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE), virgin PET, virgin polypropylene (PP) and recycled HDPE. Aside from the different options of the type of materials, the various properties considered in the calculation include tensile strength, melting point, glass transition temperature, melt flow index, coefficient of thermal expansion, and cost. Moreover, a redesigned breadboard was produced thru 3D printing using a recycled PET as filament source. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

It focuses on the effects of FGF printing parameters on the mechanical properties of rPET and rPETG printed parts using a Gigabot X 3D printer. The design of experiments (DOE) was first performed considering the main FGF 3D printing parameters such as layer thickness, infill density and number of contours. The experimental studies were then carried out to study the effects of printing parameters on the tensile properties based on the DOE. The effect of interlayer bonding of printed parts on the tensile properties was also evaluated using finite element-based multiscale modelling. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transformation infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy were used to observe the fracture morphology and chemical structure of post-FGF printing products. The tensile test results indicate that the highest tensile strength of 26.4 MPa was obtained for rPET when using a 1.1-mm layer thickness, a 70% infill density, and 3 contours, whereas, for rPETG, the maximum tensile strength of 44.8 MPa was attained with a 1.2-mm layer thickness, a 100% infill density, and 2 contours. FTIR analysis confirms no significant changes of characteristic peaks for PET in the printed products, suggesting that rPET and rPETG are viable materials for FGF printing. Thermal stability studies also reveal that the glass transition temperature and onset degradation temperatures are not significantly affected by the printing parameters. The study demonstrates the potential of rPET and rPETG as sustainable alternatives to virgin materials and provides insights into the optimal processing conditions for achieving highquality 3D printed parts via the FGF technique.

AB 3D printing has received lots of attention due to its limitless potential and advantages in comparison to traditional manufacturing processes. This study focuses on the most popular type of home 3D printers, namely fused filament fabrication (FFF) printers, which use plastic filaments as the feedstock. The rather high material cost and large amount of plastic waste generated by FFF 3D printers have driven the need for plastic filaments produced from recycled plastic waste. This study evaluates, in terms of physical characterization, the feasibility of using recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE), one of the most commonly used plastics, as the feedstock for 3D printers, in comparison with the common acrylonitrile butadiene styrene plastic pellets. In-house extrusion using recycled HDPE pellets and flakes is possible. The diameter consistency and extrusion rate results, along with other physical characterization results, including differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and water absorption, suggest that making filaments from recycled HDPE pellets is a viable option, as the obtained filament has favorable water rejection and comparable extrusion rate and thermal stability. Existing methods for overcoming the warping and adhesion problems in 3D printing with HDPE were also reviewed. In order to increase the market competitiveness of waste-derived filaments, optimization of the extrusion process, studies on the mechanical and aging properties, and development of a standard characterization methodology and database are crucial.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA), a rapidly emerging bio-based plastic, faces challenges in reinforcement due to its weak mechanical properties and poor interface adhesion with carbon fibre surfaces. This study introduces an MXene/ recycled carbon fibre (rCF) reinforced PLA 3D printing material, prepared through electrostatic self-assembly of MXene and recycled carbon fibre. MXene addition significantly enhances the fibre-substrate interface bonding in fibre-reinforced PLA filaments. This results in the printed parts displaying enhanced toughness, the flexural strength achieved of 105.45 MPa, modules of 5.98Gpa, and notched impact strength of 7.12 kJ/m2, realizing 15.6 %, 112.1 %, and 31.8 % improvements, respectively in comparison to pure PLA. Additionally, the modified PLA demonstrates absorption-dominated superior electromagnetic shielding performance. This research offers a viable approach for enhancing recycled carbon fibre-reinforced thermoplastic PLA and insights into designing sustainable, structurally, and functionally integrated composites.

AB Engineered cementitious composites (ECC) have emerged as promising materials for 3D printed concrete. This study delves into the vertical interlayer bonding properties of layer-by-layer 3D printed ECC. Techniques such as X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were employed to examine the pore characteristics and micromorphology. Furthermore, the influences of various printing and material parameters, including single-layer printing height, recycled fine aggregate replacement ratio, and fiber volume fraction, were analyzed. The findings indicate that as the fiber volume fraction and single-layer printing height increased, the bonding strength of vertical interlayer interfaces first rose and then declined. Differently, the bonding strength of these interfaces was inversely related to the replacement ratio of recycled fine aggregate. Moreover, the matrix and interfacial pores in 3D printed ECC have the shape of flattened ellipsoids, and an increase in printing height contributed to a notable improvement in sphericity. The thickness of the interlayer interface reflects the development of interlayer bonding strength to some extent. A thinner interface region reduced interlayer interface porosity and was beneficial for the adhesive properties of interlayer hydration products. The study evidences that the characteristics of interlayer pores, influenced by different printing and material parameters, play a pivotal role in interlayer bonding capability, which is important for quality control in 3D printed concrete.

AB 3D printing is a promising technique to fabricate flexible parts and reduce the supply chain. Various materials, such as metal powders, plastics, ultraviolet (UV) sensitive resins, can be fabricated from 3D printing and form the final printed part. Currently, most researchers either focus on exploring printable materials with good property or focus on the process quality control given a certain type of material. However, for many 3D printing processes, the printing process and product properties are dependent on both the material properties and process settings. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the quantitative analysis of the interactions of material properties and printing process settings are rarely studied. In this paper, we treat the material preparation and 3D printing as different manufacturing stages, and we explore the multi-stage effects in 3D printing. In particular, we add carbon fiber to the CLEAR resin to alter the material properties for a stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing process. It is observed that the part properties are jointly affected by material properties and printing process settings. Therefore, the material property and process settings should be jointly considered for optimizing 3D printing processes.

AB With the increasing use of 3D printers especially the fused filament fabrication type in the industries and general public, there is indeed a need to consider the after-use treatment for the products. The use of recycled filaments as the feedstock for 3D printers is a feasible alternative, but its application is limited to rather poor product quality. This study, thus, evaluates the effects of adding iron (Fe), silicon (Si), chromium (Cr), and aluminum (Al) nano-crystalline powders into the recycled polypropylene/high-density polyethylene plastics feedstock for filament extrusion. Physical and mechanical analysis tests revealed that the addition of 1% Fe-Si-Cr or Fe-Si-Al resulted in better thermal stability, and up to 37% and 17% improvement, respectively, in yield strength and Young modulus compared with the original recycled filaments, possibly due to the enhancement of interfacial adhesion between the nano-metal powders and the polymer, leading to reduced crack formation.

AB Advanced materials with high oil recycling capability plays a crucial role in rescuing marine lives from oil spill catastrophe. The existing absorption and filtration method can partially solve the challenge; however, a highly recyclable, low energy cost, and environmentally friendly method for collecting oil on open water is still missing. Herein, a novel concept, using newly developed membrane for collecting oil, with surface tension confinement and gravity is proposed. Using a 3D-printed superhydrophobic and oleophilic membrane, this self-floating device can selectively collect oil on water surfaces. The device can be automatically driven by a robot and achieves outstanding reusability toward oil recycling. This novel chemical concept will enable future research development of oil-water separation and oil recycling.

AB The three-dimensional printing is a manufacturing method involving the addition of materials by using certain principles valid in printing techniques. There are various techniques of a three-dimensional printing method and the most of them could be applied inclusively to generate objects of polymers. The objective of the research presented in this paper was to analyze the capabilities of 3D printing process or equipment of generating fine details and to identify a way of evaluating these capabilities when using polyester PLA as filament material. The systemic analysis of the printing techniques which use a fused polymer filament deposition showed that there are some groups of factors able to affect the obtaining of fine details. An experimental research was designed in order to highlight the influence exerted by the diameter of the nozzle orifice and by the values of sharp angles of isosceles triangles on the heights of these triangles, thus obtaining an image concerning the possibilities of generating sharp edges by three-dimensional printing. To evaluate the capacity of the 3D printing process of obtaining thin walls, a spiral including linear segments with a decreasing thickness from 1 mm was also achieved on the test piece. By mathematical processing of the experimental results using a specialized software, empirical mathematical models were determined to evaluate the intensity of influences exerted by the two process input factors on the heights corresponding to isosceles triangles characterized by sharp angles.

AB 3D printing has been recognized as an efficient and sustainable technology in the fields of advanced manufacturing. In the past few years, a considerable research, including basic theoretical research, technology innovation and industries application, have been conducted to promote 3D printing for a better performance in manufacturing. However, the benefits of 3D printing from environmental perspective are still to be seen and its sustainability is also a mystery. This paper presents a critical review about the qualitative and quantitative environmental impact of 3D printing to provide a comprehensive understanding of 3D printing for the public and provide a better guide for the future research. In addition, based on the principle of multi-objective optimization, this paper proposes a novel framework for 3D printing processes sustainability assessment and improvement by integrating the product Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). At last, recommendations about major concerns when analyzing the sustainability of 3D printing are put forward, which might be considered for the coming research.

   acid; 3D printing waste; Circular economy

AB Plastic production has experienced exponential growth in recent decades, resulting in a significant increase in plastic waste worldwide due to its durability and non-biodegradable nature. With the rapid development and worldwide utilization of material extrusion (ME) 3D printers, the generation of 3D printed thermoplastic waste has also increased rapidly. However, ME 3D printers themselves can offer a promising solution for implementing a novel, practical, and cost-effective approach to distributed recycling of 3D printed waste. While previous studies have predominantly focused on validating and evaluating the distributed recycling using the filamentbased material extrusion (FME) method, research on distributed recycling over multiple cycles (more than two) using the granule-based material extrusion (GME) method is limited. This can be attributed to the fact that the GME process is relatively immature compared to the more established FME method, and recent studies on the GME method have mainly focused on the viability, optimization of processing parameters, and mechanical performance of GME printed specimens. To address this research gap, this study aimed to comprehensively investigate the GME-based distributed recycling of PLA waste over multiple recycling generations using a multiscale characterization framework, including tensile tests, hardness tests, mass measurements, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), color measurements, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and rheometer tests. The results of this study demonstrated consistent decreases in the tensile strength, melting temperature, and rheological properties of the recycled PLA samples with the increase of recycling cycles. These changes were consistent with the gradual decrease in the average molecular weights of the PLA samples. Notably, the recycling process was terminated after the third recycling cycle due to the distinct color exhibited by the third recycling printed specimens compared to the initially printed PLA specimens, as indicated by chromaticity measurements.

AB The fused deposition modeling (FDM) printer is a simple, affordable and widely used device in the 3D printing society. However, the high price of printing materials is one of major restrictive factors for its further application. Based on the self-supporting property of printing materials, we present an optimization method to reduce the total material consumption of 3D printed objects themselves and their support structures for FDM printers in this paper. We first develop an orientation optimization scheme to reduce the outer support volume of a printed model. The volume is evaluated according to the depths of 3D model fragments obtained by the depth peeling technique in an optimization process. We then build a self-supporting frame with a set of scale-adaptive parallelepiped grids to replace the solid interior of the printed model for further reducing the material consumption. In our orientation optimization scheme, the overhanging area detecting function can detect the self-supporting regions of a 3D model in terms of the depths stored in the graphical processing unit memory. The self-supporting frame with grid structures inside printed models does not need to add additional support structures during the printing process. Experimental results indicate that our method is faster and consumes less printing materials than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

AB The main goal of this research was to investigate the influence of additive manufacturing (AM) printing parameters on the mechanical properties and surface roughness of specimens fabricated using recycled polylactic acid (rPLA). In order to achieve this goal, significant printing parameters such as layer thickness, infill density, and nozzle temperature were selected based on prior research. A three-level L9 orthogonal array, based on the Taguchi method, was used in the experimental design. The mechanical properties of virgin PLA and recycled PLA printed specimens were examined and compared. To facilitate the analysis of variance (ANOVA) examination, the response data for mechanical and surface roughness parameters were transformed to signal-to-noise (S/N) ratios. The inspected responses under consideration were the surface roughness, shore D hardness, tensile strength, flexural strength, and impact strength. The main findings suggest that careful consideration of the layer height is crucial for achieving optimum mechanical properties in the recycled PLA specimens. Furthermore, the nozzle temperature also played an important factor that affected the mechanical and surface roughness properties of the 3D printed PLA specimens. Microscopic investigation demonstrated that the number and size of voids increased significantly when the layer thickness and temperature were low, namely, 0.1 mm and 195 celcius, respectively. Finally, the optimal combination of printing parameters for each performance characteristic was determined. Following this, a confirmation test was performed using the preferred combination of parameters, which indicated a strong correlation with the outcomes predicted statistically. The results obtained from this study revealed that recycled PLA exhibited mechanical properties comparable to that of virgin PLA under certain conditions. In summary, the results of this study will serve as a valuable dataset in the field of additive manufacturing, providing valuable insights for other researchers working with recycled PLA material.

The promising future of this technology makes its impact on traditional industry unpredictable. 3D printing will propel the revolution of fabrication modes forward, and bring in a new era for customized fabrication by realizing the five "any"s: use of almost any material to fabricate any part, in any quantity and any location, for any industrial field. Innovations in material, design, and fabrication processes will be inspired by the merging of 3D-printing technology and processes with traditional manufacturing processes. Finally, 3D printing will become as valuable for manufacturing industries as equivalent and subtractive manufacturing processes.

AB Over the past decade, 3D printing technology has been leading the manufacturing revolution. A recent development in the field of 3D printing has added time as a fourth dimension to obtain 4D printing parts. A fabricated design created by 3D printing is static, whereas a design created by 4D printing is capable of altering its shape in response to environmental factors. The phrase "4D printing" was introduced by Tibbits in 2013, and 4D printing has since grown in popularity. Different smart materials, stimulus, and manufacturing methods have been published in the literature to promote this new technology. This review paper provides a description of 4D printing technology along with its features, benefits, limitations, and drawbacks. This paper also reviews a variety of 4D printing applications in fields such as electronics, renewable energy, aerospace, food, healthcare, and fashion wear. The review discusses gaps in the research, the current challenges in 4D printing, and the future of 4D printing.

AB Three dimensional printing has gained considerable interest lately due to the proliferation of inexpensive devices as well as open source software that drive those devices. Countless possibilities exist, but the printing pipeline remains the same, going from object modeling through CAD software to the slicing of the 3D model and its further printing. This work proposes a modification in the way 3D printing content is both modeled and printed. The input comes from 2D drawings, while the printing occurs over the same drawing used before. This way, the original paper containing the drawing is "augmented" by the 3D printing material, since there is a registration between both real and 3D printing coordinates. By attaching a webcam to a 3D printer, we were able to make the entire system understand the drawing by seeing it and follow its contours during the printing process. We suggest distinct application scenarios that can benefit from this promising technology, ranging from architecture professionals to visually impaired people.

AB 3D printing known as additive manufacturing has been widely used in academics and industries to make various 3D objects for various applications. The strength of the 3D printing parts is different from its original material strength due to this additive manufacturing technique. The 3D printing parts should be treated as anisotropic materials. However, the information of mechanical property such as the ultimate strength of 3D printing parts is very limited. There is little information about the mechanical property of 3D printing parts at different print angles. This research was focused on exploring the mechanical properties of 3D printing objects. The tensile test specimen of two different materials: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene-electrostatic dissipative (ABS-ESD) and Nylon 12 were printed at the 5 different print angles through the Fortus 450mc 3D printer. Tensile test results, data analysis, detailed discussion and the empirical formula of the tensile strength of 3D printing objects vs different print angles will be presented.

AB Fused deposition modeling printing is a material extrusion (MEX) process that has gained popularity over the years due to its increased affordability and greater versatility. There is a wide variety of MEX printing technologies and a broad spectrum of materials that can be 3D printed, ranging from metallic to non-metallic materials. MEX has emerged as the most common technology in consumer-grade, desktop 3D printers for printing thermoplastics, such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid. High-density polyethylene (HDPE) is a widely used thermoplastic material for product packaging. The sheer availability of recyclable or recycled HDPE (rHDPE) from used packaging has led to efforts to apply it in MEX printing. However, rHDPE presents challenges as a filament material, including issues such as part detachment from the print bed and high warpage. The focus of this study is to determine the optimal conditions that can mitigate, if not eliminate, the print bed adhesion problems associated with printing rHDPE filaments. This was achieved by conducting a series of tests to address these challenges, including part removability relating to the shear strength of print bed adhesion to identify the necessary range of print bed adhesion and corresponding parameters.

AB Combining recycled carbon fiber (rCF) and 3D printing technology has shown great potential for fabricating functional prototypes and production parts used in the aerospace and automotive industries. However, it is still a challenge to design flame-retardant 3D printed parts with high mechanical properties and flame-retardant rating. In the work, a flame-retardant polyamide (PA)-based composite for material extrusion 3D printing was prepared by utilization of rCF, polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS), and 9,10-Dihydro-9-oxa-10-phosphaphenanthrene (DOPO)-based flame retardant. The 3D-printed composites have high thermal stability, mechanical properties, and excellent flame retardancy with a V-0 rating. With the benefits of material extrusion 3D printing, directionally arranged rCF in 3D printed composites could effectively inhibit the fire spread, extend the time to ignition (TTI), reduce the total heat release (THR) and total smoke release (TSR) of 3D printed composites. The directional flame-retardant mechanism is mainly the thermal conductivity mechanism of the condensed phase and the promotion of stable ordered carbon layer formation. It provides a promising path for designing high-performance flame-retardant materials.

AB PurposeThis study aims to present an experimental approach to develop a high-strength 3D-printed recycled polymer composite reinforced with continuous metal fiber.Design/methodology/approachThe continuous metal fiber composite was 3D printed using recycled and virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene-blended filament (RABS-B) in the ratio of 60:40 and postused continuous brass wire (CBW). The 3D printing was done using an in-nozzle impregnation technique using an FFF printer installed with a self-modified nozzle. The tensile and single-edge notch bend (SENB) test samples are fabricated to evaluate the tensile and fracture toughness properties compared with VABS and RABS-B samples.FindingsThe tensile and SENB tests revealed that RABS-B/CBW composite 3D printed with 0.7 mm layer spacing exhibited a notable improvement in Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, elongation at maximum load and fracture toughness by 51.47%, 18.67% and 107.3% and 22.75% compared to VABS, respectively.Social implicationsThis novel approach of integrating CBW with recycled thermoplastic represents a significant leap forward in material science, delivering superior strength and unlocking the potential for advanced, sustainable composites in demanding engineering fields.Originality/valueLimited research has been conducted on the in-nozzle impregnation technique for 3D printing metal fiber-reinforced recycled thermoplastic composites. Adopting this method holds the potential to create durable and high-strength sustainable composites suitable for engineering applications, thereby diminishing dependence on virgin materials.

AB 3D printing technology has revolutionized free-form construction and customization demand through its ease of use, fast production, accurate, regulated deposition, and flexibility with soft functional materials. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is an ideal technique for the 3D printing of plastics. The low cost, high prototyping precision, and ease of use make it a popular additive manufacturing process. The dimensional stability, quality, functionality, and properties of printed specimens are all affected by the process parameters used in the FDM technology. As such, the present work investigates the effect of the infill pattern and infill density on the PETG mechanical characteristics. The work also finds the optimum parameters to enhance the mechanical properties using the response surface methodology (RSM). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to study micro-surface defects under different processing conditions. Based on the tensile strength experiments, the concentric pattern was recorded to have the highest UTS, E, and yield values compared to the other designs, at 28.53 MPa, 0.81 GPa, and 20.00 MPa, respectively. In contrast, from compression analysis, the highest compression strength and compression modulus (24.03 MPa and 3.71 GPa, respectively) were obtained for the triangular infill pattern, which absorbs more compressive force compared with the other patterns. Meanwhile, it was also observed that increasing the density from 25 to 75% improves mechanical properties. The RSM analysis reveals the significant parameters for both testing methodologies with mathematical models to predict the properties with 95% certainty.

AB Buildings can be rapidly constructed using 3D printed concrete technology without formwork, garnering increasing attention within the construction industry. The effects of different printing parameters on the splitting tensile strength, shear strength, pore structure, and micromorphology of the interface between 3D printed ECC and post-cast concrete were investigated, including single-layer printing height, fiber content, and recycled sand replacement ratio. The results indicated that as the fiber content and single-layer printing height increased, the interfacial bond strength was initially enhanced while subsequently decreased, with optimal bond strength achieved at a 15 mm single-layer printing height. Moderate fiber content and single-layer printing height were beneficial for interfacial bond strength. Meanwhile, the interfacial bond strength was reduced due to the evolution of interfacial pore structure after the incorporation of recycled sand. The splitting tensile strength and shear strength of the interface between 3D printed ECC and post-cast concrete decreased by 36.1 % and 35.8 %, respectively, when the replacement ratio of recycled sand in ECC was 100 %. Additionally, models for the interfacial shear strength between 3D printed ECC and post-cast concrete were proposed.

AB 3D concrete printing technology has seen rapid development due to its high digitalization and automation. Using recycled sand from solid waste construction resources to replace natural sand has great environmental and economic benefits. The objective of this study was to investigate the workability and anisotropic hardened properties of 3D printed engineered cementitious composites (3DP-ECC) incorporating recycled sand. Effects of recycled sand replacement ratio, fiber content, and printing direction on workability and hardened mechanical properties of 3DP-ECC were investigated. The test results show that the addition of recycled sand reduced fluidity, while strengthened buildability of 3DP-ECC. Compressive strength of the casted concrete dropped 2.1% and 7.2% when the replacement ratio of RS was set at 50% and 100%, respectively. The highest compressive strength in X axis of the 3D-printed specimens was observed. At 100% replacement ratio of recycled sand, the tensile strain capacity of both casted and 3D printed specimens increased by 57% and 55% respectively, compared with the reference group with natural sand. It is demonstrated that the ductility of the proposed 3DP-ECC could be significantly improved. The proposed 3DP-ECC incorporating recycled sand provides a potential solution for utilization of sustainable 3DP concrete in large-scale 3D concrete printing construction.

AB In the recent years, the additive ( layer) manufacturing technology, which emerged about three decades back, to assist design conceptualization and visualization through rapid prototyping, has created application interests beyond rapid prototyping. This transition beyond prototyping, i.e. transition to production of functional parts is driven by several other progresses including availability of advanced printing machines and materials including metal printing capabilities. Among others, the unlimited geometrical complexity, low material wastage, environmental friendly and in most cases economically viable operations of additive manufacturing are the key factors that attract diverse industrial sectors to further explore the potentials of this technology for production of fully functional parts. There even exists a sense of feeling, at many corners, that this technology will significantly change the global economy and the way business is done in the future, in a similar way the www technology and the smart phone technology did. Aimed to put a very small drop into this potentially huge future research and development area and based on existing experiences, published works and ongoing research activities, this article shades light on the prospects of the additive manufacturing technology as a production method for the future industry. Two of the most potential technologies, fused deposition modeling and selective laser melting, are described and potential challenges highlighted. In line with the national interests and international focus, the medical sector and the offshore oil and gas industry are identified as the best beneficiaries if additive manufacturing is used for functional part production.

AB This study focuses on 3D printed alkali-activated recycled sand concrete (AARSC), a material that offers environmental benefits and design flexibility. The 3D printing process creates interfaces between filaments and layers, which may become potential weak points and increase interfacial inhomogeneity and discontinuity. Therefore, evaluating fracture resistance of interfaces is vital for ensuring the reliability of 3D printed materials. This work develops a model that accounts for discontinuity and inhomogeneity, enabling the determination of more realistic interfacial tensile bond strength (ft) f t ) and fracture toughness (KIC) K IC ) for 3D printed AARSC. The model establishes a linear relationship between the maximum load (Fmax) F max ) and interfacial fracture parameters, allowing the determination of size-independent f t and K IC through analytical solutions. Three-point bending tests were conducted on 3D printed AARSC beams with different interface types and recycled sand replacement ratios to systematically evaluate the effect of recycled sand content on the interfacial fracture properties. The results show that the predicted interfacial f t and K IC exhibited size-independence as intrinsic interfacial properties. Moreover, f t values of the inter-layer interface were slightly higher than those of the inter-filament interface for the same recycled sand content, with the largest observed difference at 100% recycled sand replacement, being 22.7%. When the replacement ratio increased from 60% to 100%, the decrease in f t became significant, with the reduction rates increasing to 32.0% and 26.4% for Type I and Type II interfaces, respectively. Additionally, a positive correlation was observed between the recycled sand content and the anisotropy in fracture behaviors of 3D printed AARSC.

AB Heterogenization of Eosin Y by 3D-printing and its application in photocatalysis are reported. The approach allows a fine tuning of the photocatalyst morphology and its rapid preparation. Photocatalytic activity was evaluated through model organic reactions involving oxidation, reduction, and photosensitization pathways. The efficiency, recyclability and stability of 3D printed EY is remarkable paving the way to new generation of heterogeneous photocatalysts with a perfect control of their shape and adaptable to any photoreactors.
   3D-printed Eosin Y was prepared by radical photopolymerization to obtain new heterogeneous photocatalyst with a well-defined morphology. Taking advantage of the 3D-printing technology, the heterogeneous EY was designed to fit around the magnetic stirring bar to facilitate both implementation of various organic transformations and catalyst recovery. This very robust photocatalyst is easily recycled and the efficiency was still very high even after 8 reactions. image

AB Three dimensionally printed concrete (3DPC) is an interesting topic that has attracted increasing attention during the last few years. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the utilization of waste materials in 3DPC. The literature on the different waste materials that have been utilized in 3DPC, such as silica fume, fly ash, recycled sand, waste glass, municipal incineration ash, ground granulated blast furnace slag, and steel slag, are reviewed. The influence of these waste materials on the main parameters of 3D printing of concrete such as the buildability, extrudability, and open time are discussed. In addition, the paper addressed the effect of these wastes on the mechanical strengths of the printed concrete. This paper finds that merging the technology of 3D printing of concrete with the usage waste materials will revolutionize the construction industry by addressing the challenges in meeting the required strength parameters of concrete using 3D printing technology and at the same time making construction process more economically and environmentally viable. Finally, to improve the efficiency of this emerging construction technique, authors recommend using combination of different waste materials together, taking into consideration using some additives to balance out the negative effects of waste materials on other parameters.

AB This study achieved the synchronized reinforcement of 3D printed mortar with steel cables by modifying the printing equipment. Recycled sintered brick powder replaced 30 % of cement in the 3D printed mortar mixture. The optimal range for the open time was determined through flowability tests and preliminary tests, which ranged from 10 to 40 min. Ways to improve the reinforcement ratio without compromising buildability were explored. The bond strength between the steel cables and the printed mortar was tested and found to be approximately 2-2.5 MPa. The flexural strength of the printed beams with steel cable reinforcement increased by 172%-357 %, and multiple cracks occurred at the mid -span during the failure process. A correction formula for the flexural strength was provided, with calculated values showing an error within 12 % of the test values.

AB Recent advances in 3D printing technologies bring wide range of applications from fast prototyping to product manufacturing. However, one intrinsic limitation of 3D printing is that we cannot fabricate a single object that is larger than the working volume of a 3D printer. To address this issue, we may partition the given object into 3D parts of manageable sizes for printing, and then assemble the object from the printed 3D parts. Rather than using connectors, glue, or skew, we propose to connect the printed 3D parts by 3D interlocking such that the assembled object can be not only repeatedly disassembled and reassembled, but also strongly connected by the parts' own geometry. To achieve these, we develop a voxelization-based approach to partition a given 3D model into 3D interlocking parts. To guarantee the generated 3D parts to be structurally sound and well-connected by 3D interlocking, we deform the local geometry of the 3D model to avoid voxel fragmentation, employ internal voxels to create initial interlocking parts, and analyze the local shape within voxels to guide the final parts construction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 3D models with a variety of shapes, and realize some of them by 3D printing. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The research regarding additive manufacturing methods (AM) is popular among new researchers from industrial workers or university students since this technology is most likely to pioneer manufacturing industries in the future. Almost all the studies conducted by past researchers are related to the material properties of the 3D printing machine regardless of the type of material including Selective Laser Melting (SLM) 3D printing machines which utilize metal powder as the primary material. Plus, there is a study on the difference between virgin and recycled powder material in terms of material properties for SLM 3D printing machines. In this study, we conducted Charpy impact tests on metal specimens fabricated from both virgin and recycled powders, varying the print thicknesses in accordance with ASTM E23 standards. For each thickness parameter, three specimens were produced, irrespective of the material state. The selective laser melting (SLM) machine maintained consistent printing parameters for both virgin and recycled materials, while permitting flexibility in the adjustment of specimen coordinates within the production bed. Therefore, the impact test result will determine which material condition delivers the best result of the specimens' absorbed energy (J) and impact toughness (J/cm(2)).

AB The development of sustainable mixtures has been a widely researched topic in the last decade, as the cement and concrete industries are among the most polluting sectors. Recycled materials can eliminate the need for extraction of natural materials through re-utilization of waste, reducing the environmental impact. To date, few studies have analyzed the effects of incorporating recycled glass aggregates on the water transport properties and microstructure of 3D printable mixtures. This study assesses the feasibility of incorporating recycled glass as a replacement for natural aggregate in 3D printable mixtures. For this purpose, three normal-weight and three lightweight mixtures containing 0, 50, and 100 vol.% of recycled glass aggregate as basalt aggregate replacement were evaluated in cast and printed samples. Expanded thermoplastic microspheres (ETM) were included to create the lightweight mixture composition. This experimental work evaluated the effects of incorporating recycled glass, ETM, and the impact of the printing process on the microstructure, sorption, and capillary water porosity (CWP). The printing process has proven to be an influential factor affecting the shape, size, and quantity of porosity. In addition, the printing process was demonstrated to be more influential on porosity formation than the inclusion of recycled glass or ETM. Incorporating recycled glass results in a slight decrease in the P Hg porosity, more spherical pores, and lower anisotropic tendency. Furthermore, adding ETM has a filling effect, leading to a more compact microstructure.

SO GREEN CHEMISTRY

DT Article
AB Photo-curing three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is widely used in various advanced fields. However, the extensive use of nonrenewable fossil resources as raw materials to prepare prepolymers and the disposal of 3D printing materials have imposed a serious burden on the environment. In this study, a series of bio-based, reprocessable, and reprintable digital light processing (DLP) printing polymerizable deep eutectic solvents (PDESs), named CDAG, were prepared from citric acid (CA) and glycerol (Gly), thereby offering a novel sustainable DLP printing strategy. These materials exhibited high bio-based content (46.9%-58.3%), exceptional transparency, and tunable mechanical properties They also demonstrated self-healing capabilities in certain organic solvent environments. Remarkably, hydrogen bond self-assembly conferred the printed material with reprocessability and reprintability. Multi-color objects were easily fabricated using the novel CDAG-based assembly welding printing method. This approach overcame the limitation of color distribution in traditional DLP printing. Notably, the printed models and auxiliary printing materials could be rapidly recycled and reused to print new models. Reprintable sacrificial molds, which could be easily and quickly demolded by using water, were printed. A reprintable temperature-locked quick response (QR) code was also printed using CDAG composites with thermochromic microcapsules. Furthermore, the thermochromic microcapsules could be recycled without damage and used for reprinting new QR codes. This study has important implications for developing sustainable DLP printing and green DLP manufacturing technologies.

AB The performance of 3D printed concrete (3DPC) is more complex than that of the cast one due to differences in the mix ratio, preparation and curing method. This paper focuses on the effect of material and equipment optimization on the improvement of 3DPC performance. In order to comprehensively consider the effects of recycled aggregates and the printing process on concrete properties, natural aggregate printed and recycled aggregate cast specimens were designed as control groups. The characteristics of 3DPC mixed with recycled materials were systematically analyzed from green state to post-hardening with the control group. The test results show that the alternative use of recycled aggregates effectively improves the deformation stability of the extruded concrete in the green state. Compared with the vertical nozzle without a scraper, the vertical nozzle with 40 mm height scrapers could reduce the vertical deformation of 3DPC by 2025%. The maximum height and width deformation of the printed filament are only 3.20 mm and 0.72 mm, respectively, for a fully recycled aggregate replacement specimen. In addition, the porous nature of recycled aggregates makes them more suitable for on-site printing and maintenance due to the internal curing effect of water in the old mortar.

AB In recent years, the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) printing has been expanding due to advances in technology and economic efficiency. One of the 3D printing technologies is fused deposition modeling, which can be used to create different kinds of products or prototypes from various polymer filaments. In this study, the activated carbon (AC) coating was introduced to the 3D outputs printed using recycled polymer materials to impart multi-functions such as adsorption of harmful gas and antimicrobial activities. A filament of uniform diameter (1.75 mu m) and a filter template in the form of a 3D fabric shape were prepared through the extrusion and 3D printing processes, respectively, of the recycled polymer. In the next process, the 3D filter was developed by coating the nanoporous AC, produced from the pyrolysis fuel oil and waste PET, on the 3D filter template through direct coating. The 3D filters coated with the nanoporous activated carbon showed the enhanced adsorption capacity of 1038.74 mg of SO2 gas and the antibacterial properties of 49% removal of E. coli bacteria. As a model system, a functional gas mask that has harmful gas adsorption abilities and antibacterial properties has been produced by a 3D printing process.

AB This study investigated the hardened mechanical properties of 3D printed mortar (3DPM) with different contents (0-30% by mass of cement) of recycled powder (RP) by anisotropic compressive, splitting tensile and flexural strengths. The pore characteristics tested by X-ray computed tomography and mercury intrusion porosimeter as well as hydration products of 3DPM were analyzed to reveal the influence mechanism of RP on 3DPM. The results showed that the highest compressive strength of the 3D printed specimens was obtained on the loading direction paralleled with the length of printing filament (X direction). When the RP replacement ratio was 20%, the X-direction compressive strength of 3DPM was 24.11% lower than that of cast samples, while the splitting tensile strengths of 3DPM were closed to and the flexural strengths of 3DPM were higher than that of cast samples regardless of the loading directions. This can be attributed to the high fluidity loss rate of 3DPM with RP, leading to the reduction of the surface moisture of interlayer. Besides, more pores at the interlayer and interstrips led to the decrease of mechanical properties. In contrast, the addition of RP had a limited effect on the micro pore structure of the single printed filament without considering the interlayer and interstrip, owing to the secondary hydration and filling effect of RP.

AB CoCrMo and Ti6Al4V are widely used in medical, dental and 3D printing technology, allowing the accurate fabrication of geometrically complicated structures. In order to reduce the costs of printed objects, the reuse of powder is common daily practice. When using 3D printing technology, the direct impact of elevated temperatures and the influence of the laser beam may change the properties of the powder when it is reused, thus affecting the final properties of the printed object. The main aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of reused powder on the mechanical, microstructural and electrochemical properties of 3D printed objects. 3D printed objects fabricated from virgin and reused powder of both alloys were analyzed by metallographic observation, computed tomography, XRD and electrochemical methods. The main finding of the study was that the use of reused powder (recycled 3 times) does not detrimentally affect the mechanical and corrosion integrity of 3D printed CoCr and Ti6Al4V alloys, especially for the purpose of applications in dentistry.

AB The application of concrete 3D printing technology in cold regions still faces durability challenges. The incorporation of coarse aggregates can significantly enhance the durability of 3D printed concrete, making it a priority consideration for optimizing the performance of 3D printed mortar. This work focuses on pore structure characteristics and investigates the effects of varying recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) replacement ratios (0 %, 50 %, 100 %) on the apparent morphology, mass loss, and relative dynamic elastic modulus of 3D printed recycled aggregate concrete (3DPRAC) under freeze-thaw (F-T) cycling conditions. Comprehensive analyses of the internal pore structure of 3DPRAC were conducted via X-ray computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy. The results showed that the F-T resistance of 3DPRAC was inferior to that of cast concrete. Although the incorporation of RCA exacerbates F-T damage in 3D printed concrete, this damage did not necessarily worsen with increasing RCA replacement ratios. The unique ellipsoidal pores in 3DPRAC, along with the porous old mortar and its ITZ contained in the RCA, were identified as key factors in degrading the F-T resistance of 3DPRAC by promoting the development of crack networks. Finally, the degradation mechanisms of the F-T resistance of 3DPRAC based on pore structure characteristics were discussed. This research deepens the understanding of the durability performance of 3DPRAC and may facilitate the application of digital concrete manufacturing technology in cold regions.

AB The three-dimensional (3D) printing of recycled carbon fiber was demonstrated by the fused filament fabrication technique. A recycled carbon fiber spun yarn was processed into a filament for 3D printing using polyamide 6 and polyamide 12 as the matrix. The fibers were aligned in the axial direction of the filament, and the filament followed the print path during 3D printing. Four specimens were prepared from the filament by 3D printing. The effect of the 3D printing process on the tensile properties of the recycled carbon fiber filament was evaluated. The comparison of the four specimens showed that the 3D-printing process adversely affected the tensile properties of the composite by damaging the fibers and dispersing the fiber direction. Multiplying the filament compensated for the variability in the tensile properties and improved the tensile properties of the 3D-printed coupon. The 3D-printed recycled carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide showed intermediate properties between those of 3D-printed continuous and milled carbon fiber composites. 3D printing is an effective molding technique for the use of recycled carbon fibers.

AB A novel shear test method on shear bond behavior of 3D printed interlayer interfaces and interstrip interfaces was proposed in this study. Thereafter, the effect of different replacement ratios of recycled sand, printing intervals, and surface treatments were investigated. The test results showed that under the same printing condition, the interfacial shear strengths of interlayer interface and interstrip interface were similar to each other. The interfacial shear strength slightly decreased with the increase of the replacement ratio of recycled sand, while it sharply decreased with the extension of printing interval time. The interfaces in 3D printed recycled mortar had higher time sensitivity compared with 3D printed natural mortar. Considering that discontinuous construction will introduce inferior interfaces in 3D printed concrete components, effective surface treatments should be conducted. According to the test results, the improvement effect of surface treatments was epoxy paste > cement paste > surface wetting > no treatment.

AB Polypropylene is widely used in the automobile, paint, and consumer product industries and is not biodegradable. Recycling polypropylene is essential to maintaining sustainability. When the polypropylene as a 3D filament is used to print a component, wrapping issue is created. Therefore, fewer articles have been published. In this study, virgin and recycled polypropylene was reinforced with tamarind fruit shell power (TFSP) as a filler to make the 3D composite filament and solution for wrapping issue was sought. The crystallite size of TFSP was 39.7 nm, and its thermal constancy was 230 degrees C. It also had a great crystallinity index of 43.6%. The exterior morphology of TFSPs was studied using an atomic force microscope and a scanning electron microscope. The results of flexural and tensile tests conducted on composites made of virgin and recycled polypropylene reinforced with TFSP showed that 3 wt% reinforcement is the optimal mix to produce better characteristics. An impact testing, it was found that 1.5 wt% reinforcement produces better results. All of the aforementioned findings unequivocally demonstrated that recycled polypropylene, with a tolerance limit of 15%, can be used in place of virgin polypropylene.

AB The layer-by-layer stacking process of 3D Printing Construction Technology (3DPCT) inevitably leads to weak bonding areas between the interlayer interfaces and the interstrip interfaces, which affect the mechanical properties of the printed structure. The effects of different carbonation time of recycled sand on the mechanical properties and interfacial bonding performance of 3D printed cement-based material with a 100 % replacement rate of carbonated recycled sand (3DPCRS) were explored. Although, the carbonation time of recycled sand affected the mechanical anisotropy of the printed specimens, the carbonation treatment of recycled sand cannot eliminate the mechanical anisotropy of 3D printed specimens. With the extension of the carbonation time of recycled sand, the interfacial bonding performance was gradually improved. At 28 days, the interlayer shear strength and interstrip shear strength of T7 group increased by 21.5 % and 18.7 %, respectively. After the carbonation of recycled sand, the indentation modulus of the interlayer interface was increased with the decrease of interface width and porosity, which improved the pore structure and the mechanical properties of the printed specimens.

AB End-of-Life (EoL) wind turbine blades (WTBs), which pose an environmental problem because of their short service life and lack of proven recycling options, are expected to expand significantly as the wind power industry grows rapidly. Potting's "R strategy" and this study's combined investigation of the recycling and integrated use of solid debris from recycled wind turbine blades (RWTBs) in 3D printed concrete offer a creative and costeffective way to address this pressing problem. The present priority for handling the waste from wind turbine blades are closely aligned with this approach. The study aims to investigate the feasibility of incorporating RWTB components into 3D printed concrete by utilizing the advantages of this innovative construction technique, which include rapid building, labor and material savings, and the capacity to make intricate structures. Since RWTBs have about double the SiO2 concentration of cement, it has been discovered that adding a suitable amount of SiO2 improves cement hydration and the mechanical qualities of 3D printed concrete. In this study, recycled glass fibers (chopped rGF) and GFRP powder were utilized as cementitious materials, aggregates, and fiber-reinforced components. The results show that GFRP powder, which is produced by mechanical recycling, can be mixed with up to 25 % of the mass of cementitious material without affecting its mechanical strength, printability, extrudability, or buildability. In a similar vein, chopped rGF, which is mechanically recycled, can be utilized as aggregate and reinforcing material up to 20 % of the total volume. Significant integration of RWTB solid waste is demonstrated by the co-doping of chopped rGF and GFRP powder, which can account for up to 20 % of the total mass. By offering a sustainable method for recycling RWTB components in building applications, this research helps to promote the circular economy by reducing the environmental impact of disposing of wind turbine blades.

AB 3D printing ultra-high performance concrete (UHPC) can be used for additive construction of structural components, which significantly reduces the reliance on steel reinforcement. This study investigates the effects of water-to-binder (w/b) ratios, recycled steel fibre (RSF) volume fraction and thickener content on the rheological behaviour, flowability, extrudability, buildability and shape retention ability of 3D printing RSF-reinforced UHPC. The results show that decreasing the w/b ratio, RSF incorporation and thickener incorporation increase the static and dynamic yield stress of the mixture. The dynamic yield stress of the mixture increases by 27.37 % when the volume fraction of RSF is increased from 1 % to 3 % at the same w/b ratio and thickener content. The addition of thickener increases the extrudability and buildability of 3D printing RSF-reinforced UHPC, which is mainly related to the adsorption of the thickener on the surface of the cementitious material particles and the introduction of bridging forces in the system of neighbouring cementitious material particles. The shape retention ability of 3D printing RSF-reinforced UHPC can be improved by increasing RSF volume fraction and thickener content. In addition, the mixture with a w/b ratio of 0.16, RSF volume fraction of 3 % and thickener content of 0.1 % shows the best printability.

AB Incorporating waste fibers, such as those from recycled plastics or agricultural byproducts, reduces the environmental impact by diverting waste from landfills and lowering the carbon footprint of concrete production. In this paper, we are investigating the utilization of carbon fibers sourced from decommissioned wind turbine blades to create stronger and greener cement paste mixes targeting the enhanced tensile strength. We are proposing to align the carbon fibers along the direction of the mechanical stress generated by the interaction of the 3D printing (3DP) nozzle geometry and the pumped cementitious matrix. A series of threepoint bending and compression tests are conducted on 3D-printed specimens produced under different nozzle geometries, and the flexural modulus and compressive strength of specimens are examined to understand the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the extruded materials. We demonstrate the application by 3DP and testing small-scale specimens with aligned fibers and compare performance against specimens with randomly distributed fibers and controls (specimens without fibers). Results show that incorporating 2wt% of carbon fibers significantly improves the flexural and compressive strengths of 3D-printed specimens respectively by 74.6% and 34.5% when compared to 3D-printed plain cement paste, and respectively by 71.63% and 22.72% when compared to mold-cast plain cement paste.

AB In recent years, the development of alternative and more sustainable technologies for reinforced concrete structures has been attracting more and more interest, given the increasing need to reduce the impact that the construction sector has on the environment. Furthermore, 3D concrete printing (3DCP) technology falls into this context, allowing the optimization of the quantities of employed raw material to be used while at the same time allowing the possibility to design more complex elements' shapes. In the view of improving the sustainability of construction sector, the present study aims at experimentally investigating the characteristics of the fresh and hardened states of concrete mixtures incorporating different percentages of replacement of the fine aggregate with recycled aggregates of different nature. As such, the key innovative aspect of the present study is the possible investigation of cement-based mixtures produced with 100% recycled fine aggregates (both derived from concrete waste and brick elements) without affecting either the fresh or hardened mechanical properties of the resulting Recycled Aggregate Concrete (RAC) mixtures. Furthermore, in order to make this study linked to 3D printing technology, extruded concrete elements were realized and tested through a process designed to simulate the automated 3D concrete printing process: in fact, the RAC mixtures were designed in order to obtain an adequate workability and compressive strength typically adopted for ordinary 3D printed mixtures. Although some adjustments and further analyses are required in order to optimize the shape retention and stability, as well as the well-known problem of the 3D mixtures being linked to anisotropic behavior, the obtained results unveil that it was possible to observe promising characteristics for the mixes containing recycled aggregates (i.e., consistency index at the fresh state above 150 mm and compressive strength at 28 days above 50 MPa), which were in any case suitable for the creation of 3D printed structural concrete elements and can be further confirmed with future studies in order to validate their possible buildability.

AB Three-dimensional printing technology for building construction is rapidly emerging as a transformative force, offering innovative and sustainable solutions to reduce the environmental impact of the construction sector. Unlike traditional methods, this technology significantly lowers CO2 emissions by enabling the use of sustainable materials such as geopolymers and recycled aggregates. Moreover, it minimizes waste, labor requirements, and the need for extensive on-site equipment, thereby reducing the overall carbon footprint of building projects. Studies indicate that adopting 3D printing in construction can cut CO2 emissions by up to 70%, depending on the materials used. By enhancing precision and integrating automation, 3D printing optimizes material consumption, reduces transportation needs, and minimizes energy-intensive activities. This research highlights the pivotal role of 3D printing in reshaping the construction process, quantifying its potential to drive sustainability and innovation, both directly and indirectly, at multiple stages of the building lifecycle.

AB The construction industry contributes significantly to global resource depletion, energy consumption, and environmental impact. Although 3D concrete printing (3DCP) reduces labour and formwork waste, its high cement demand raises environmental concerns. Recycled aggregates (RA) offer a sustainable alternative, but their use in 3DCP is still limited, especially in real-world applications. To address this gap, this study develops an integrated framework that combines life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic evaluation, applied to a full-scale 3D-printed structural unit using RA in Jiangsu, China. The analysis covers key phases such as material acquisition, construction, transportation, and assembly. Our findings reveal that while 3D printing reduces labour and eliminates the need for formwork, its overall environmental benefits are offset by the high cement usage and transportation emissions associated with the RA material. Sensitivity analyses indicate that optimising RA proportions and reducing transportation distances could enhance the sustainability and cost-efficiency of 3DCP projects. Although 3D printing has the potential to transform construction practices, significant improvements in material composition and logistics are required to fully realise its environmental and economic advantages. By using comprehensive real-world data, this study bridges the gap between laboratory-scale investigations and practical implementation, offering a robust foundation for evaluating the sustainability of 3DCP with RA. This study provides critical insights into the practical application of 3DCP with RA, moving the field closer to achieving sustainable large-scale construction.

AB The primary (1 & DEG;) recycled polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) has been widely explored for various sensing applications. But yet little has been testified on the 3D printing of 1 & DEG; recycled PVDF-based flexible and wearable passive sensors for body-centric communication (BCC). This study presents the fabrication of 1 & DEG; recycled PVDF-based flexible and wearable sensors prepared by fused filament fabrication for BCC. For the fabrication of 3D printed passive sensors, slots, and defected ground structure was prepared for miniaturization. The results suggest that 84.88% miniaturization in the area was achieved at 2.45 GHz for Bluetooth communication with a frequency shift of 51%. The simulated reflection coefficient (S-11) was observed in agreement with the experimental data. Further, the validation shows that the proposed sensor may be used for bending radius up to 50 mm representing the built-up of a human wrist. Finally, the specific absorption rate of 0.898 W/kg ensures that the sensor may be deployed in BCC.

AB Four-dimensional (4D) printing has gained considerable attention since its conception in 2013. It was made possible by interdisciplinary studies and the rapid expansion of smart materials, three-dimensional (3D) printers, and designs. Unlike static objects produced by 3D printing, the 4D effect enables a 3D-printed structure to change its design or functionality over a period of time in reaction to environmental factors such as temperature, light, or water, rendering 3D printing "alive." This study reviews the latest significant basics and technological developments in 4D printing, as well as their features. The factors affecting 4D printing are also explored. Moreover, the employed materials are studied with a focus on their properties, mechanisms, and possible implications or uses. In addition, the various 4D printing techniques and their applications are presented. Finally, the challenges and limitations of the 4D printing domain are discussed.

AB In this paper, a novel extrusion-based 3D printed material was obtained by preparing 3D printed recycled coarse aggregate concrete (3DPRAC) using recycled coarse aggregate (RCA), and the compressive and flexural properties were investigated at different RCA replacement ratios, ages, and construction forms. The porosity, pore volume distribution, pore geometry characteristics were analyzed by X-CT. MIP and SEM were used to analyze the pore structure of the RCA. The results showed that the compressive and flexural strengths have obvious anisotropic characteristics. With increasing replacement ratio, the compressive and flexural strengths generally decreased. Internal pores of 3DPRAC were found to exhibit the geometric characteristics of flat ellipsoidal and uniaxially oriented arrangements along the printing direction. A multiple partition-interface model was proposed to establish the connection between pore structure characteristics and force cracking, and the anisotropic mechanical property mechanism of 3DPRAC was revealed.

AB Using recycled aggregates in concrete and mortar reduces environmental impact by minimizing both natural aggregate consumption and construction waste disposal. 3D printing offers innovative, cost-efficient construction methods, but it heavily relies on cement and sand. This research aims to investigate the hard properties of 3D printing mortars made with 100% substitution of natural sand by recycled sand. The effects of sand substitution and 3D printing process on the hard properties of printable mortars are studied. The mechanical strength of moulded and printed specimens of printable mortars based on recycled sand were studied and compared with those made from a reference printable mortar based on natural sand. Additionally, the microstructure of mortars, namely the density of the interfacial transition zone in these specimens was analysed to understand the mechanical strength results. The results showed that both the incorporation of recycled sand and the 3D printing process had little effect on the mechanical strength. This could be attributed to the decrease in the density of the interfacial transition zone caused by both the incorporation of recycled sand and the mortar printing process. Furthermore, the study investigated also the effect of incorporating recycled sand on autogenous, drying, and total shrinkage. It was observed that this incorporation reduces the autogenous shrinkage at an early age, while it increases both dry and total shrinkage.

AB The 3D printing technology is increasingly being recognized as a promising method for concrete fabrication in the construction industry due to its advantages of high efficiency, personalization, and the elimination of formwork. However, Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC), a crucial material for 3D printing processes, have faced limitations in large-scale application due to their high cost and environmental impact. To enhance the green sustainability of 3D printed ECC, this study substitutes recycled concrete powder (RCP) and recycled brick powder (RBP) for quartz sand at a 1:1 ratio, partially replaces cement with recycled glass powder (RGP), (with particle sizes 75-150 mu m), and polyethylene (PE) fibers are partially replaced by recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Using RGP and PET substitution rates as variables, cast specimens were used as a control group, the crack development, crack mouth opening displacement (CMOD), fracture toughness and fracture energy of 3D printed green ECC were discussed by a three-point bending experiment on a single-edge notch beam. The results indicate that the 3D printed specimens exhibit significantly faster crack initiation and propagation compared to the cast specimens. PET fibers are less effective in bridging ability than PE fibers, and their incorporation has an overall negative effect on instability fracture toughness. However, the incorporation of RGP in the 3D printing process mitigates the negative impact, especially at PET substitution rates of 30 % and 40 %, fracture toughness significantly increases at high RGP substitution rates (25 %). The synergistic effect of RGP and PET fibers significantly improve the fracture properties of 3D printed green ECC.

AB The use of 3D printing for making electrochemical sensors has grown exponentially; however, most of these sensors are designed for single use. This contributes to significant plastic and chemical waste, which can be toxic and harmful to the environment. Although some strategies have been developed to produce electrodes in a more sustainable and eco-friendly manner, they often fail to address all stages of the construction and use of 3D-printed electrodes. In this study, we investigated each phase of the construction and use of 3D-printed electrodes to establish a comprehensive green approach. Electrodes were evaluated using cyclic voltammetry with an outer-sphere redox probe. Those printed with 0 % infill exhibited higher anodic currents compared to electrodes with 100 % infill, thereby reducing the amount of thermoplastic required. Direct heat embedding of silver wire into the electrode eliminated the need for silver epoxy, offering a more environmentally friendly method of electrical connection. Seawater was employed as a green solvent for electrochemical activation and produced equivalent results to sodium hydroxide. Finally, we demonstrated a closed-loop recycling and reuse strategy for 3D-printed electrodes during measurements. The proposed approach achieved a higher Eco-scale score than the conventional method of constructing 3D-printed electrodes. Overall, this study provides essential guidance for developing and utilizing 3D-printed electrochemical sensors in a fully sustainable and environmentally responsible manner.

AB In this study, a novel shape-stabilization phase change materials (PCM) for 3D printed concrete have been generated by impregnating paraffin into the recycled fine aggregates. Based on both steady state hot plate method and transient hotwire method, the impact of printing parameters, including printing layers, path, extrusion rate and materials on thermal conductivity of the 3D printed concrete was investigated. The relationship among thermal conductivity, dry density and porosity of the 3D printed concrete was analyzed. The results showed that recycled fine aggregates can be successfully used as a support material for paraffin. The melting temperature and latent heat is 36.52 degrees C and 40.65 J/g, respectively. The thermal conductivity of 3D printed concrete was significantly influenced by the multi-layer structure and with thermal anisotropy. Under the same size, density class or mix design, the thermal conductivity of the 3D printed concrete can reach up to 31.04% lower than that of mould cast concrete. The results also indicate that impregnating paraffin into the recycled fine aggregate can improve its thermal properties so as to upgrade the overall performance of 3D printed concrete.

AB Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are well-known porous crystalline materials that have been used for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater. To enhance the adsorption performance of these adsorbents and facilitate their recycling process, we propose a hybrid composite of an MXene/metal-organic framework (MXOF) decorated on a hierarchical and self-supported porous three-dimensional (3D) printed lattice structure (3D-MXOF). In this design, the porous MXOF composite extremely enhanced the specific surface area and synergistically promoted the dye removal efficiency of 3D -printed lattices. Scanning electron microscopy images indicated that the MXOF composite was uniformly decorated on a 3D-printed lattice structure without agglomeration. The resultant supported 3D-MXOF structures were evaluated for the adsorption of anionic dyes. The results revealed high adsorption performance (91.98% for methyl orange and 84.9% for direct red 31 dyes) and fast adsorption kinetics following a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Moreover, the 3D-MXOF structure possesses a facile recycling process with sustainable adsorption performance after four consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles.

AB In this paper a more sustainable 3D printable concrete is developed by the replacement of natural aggregate in a concrete mix with recycled brick aggregate (RBA). An existing 3D printable concrete mix is used as reference and adjusted by replacing 64% of its natural aggregate with RBA. The potential for sustainability in the building sector by automation as well as recycling of construction and demolition waste is therefore addressed. To date no research exists on the use of recycled brick aggregate in 3D printed concrete, which has particular relevance in developing countries, where construction with bricks remains a popular option. Two different types of RBA from local demolition projects are considered in three mix designs containing Type 1 RBA, Type 2 RBA and a combination of Type 1 and Type 2 RBA. To arrive at the three mix designs, the water absorption and porosity of each RBA type are first tested to determine the estimated additional water requirement in each concrete mix. The ASTM mini-slump cone test is used as a replacement of a full rheological characterisation to determine the achievement of acceptable printability. After the fresh-state characterisation, the mix design containing the more porous Type 2 RBA is chosen for mechanical characterisation based on availability of materials and relevance of highly porous recycled brick aggregate in future studies. Mechanical characterisation tests are performed on the chosen RBA mix, as well as the reference 3D printable mix for comparison. The mechanical characterisation tests include compressive cube strength tests, direct tensile tests on 3D printed specimens, and uniaxial compressive tests on 3D printed specimens. The results of the mechanical characterisation tests show that the replacement of 64% of the natural aggregate with RBA in the mix reduces the compressive cube strength by 25%, the interlayer tensile 3DPC strength by 20% and the compressive 3DPC strength by 14% and 20% in Direction 1 and Direction 3 respectively.

AB 3D concrete printing technology of cementitious materials is challenging in many aspects. Despite the work-ability and mechanical properties of a mix and hardened concrete or mortar, the researchers need to face problems with environmental impact and durability of printed elements. Furthermore, today thousands of tons of waste are produced and natural aggregates which are most used resources by volume in the construction sector are on the verge of exhaustion. To date, limited knowledge about utilized of artificial aggregate (including Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in 3D printed mortar is available. The main objective of this study is to develop 3D printed mortar with PET granules as the replacement of natural aggregate (10 vol-% to 50 vol-%). The paper contributes to knowledge of properties of 3D printed composites with plastic aggregate. Four printable mixes were made: one reference mix and three mixes in which natural aggregate was replaced by PET granulate in quantities amounting to 10%, 30% and 50% (by volume), respectively. The replacement ratios were chosen on the base of literature review for ordinary cementitious mortars. Several strength tests were carried out for standard and printed specimens. In addition, a freeze-thaw resistance test and high temperature performance test were conducted to evaluate to validate the properties of artificial aggregate. The results show that PET granulate is useful in 3D printing owing to their buildability and extrudability properties. Furthermore, printed mixes with high amount of PET (30% and 50%) granulate shows high decreases in strength (up to 75%). Un-fortunately, after the freeze-thaw resistance test specimens with a high amount of PET granulate (30% and 50%) indicated high strength reduction (up to 80%). Exposure to a temperature exceeding the melting point of PET results in significant reduction of compressive strength for printed specimens (up to 68.8 % for 50 % PET addition). In addition, mixes with up to 10% PET can be used for most structural elements even under varying thermal conditions (even under extreme cold temperature).

AB 3D printing as additive manufacturing enables to give concept proposers and designers a great possibility of producing physical parts and concept models at acceptable cost during a short time. Such technology is quite distinct from traditional machining techniques adopting subtractive process. The purpose of this study is to briefly describe new micro-scale manufacture utilizing a series of process of 3D printing, including 3D modeling, 3D model slicing, printing, and products. Especially, 3D modeling is one of major components in 3D printing process and becomes a barrier to entry the business of micro-scale manufacture for everyone with a 3-D printer. This paper introduces two low-cost approaches to generate 3D models, including active and passive approaches. 3D scanning as an active approach allows the replication of real objects without the need of moulding techniques. On the other hand, image-based modeling as a passive is an alternative of un-touch model reconstruction without a threat of destructive impact to the modeled object. Also, a statue in gypsum was made by a 3D printer based on a digital 3D model generated through the low-cost active approach for demonstration.

AB Three-dimensional printers (3DP), which are often heard with additive manufacturing, are widely used in part production. Sensitive and custom-made products in different designs can be produced more easily and quickly, but waste specimen formed after the failed three-dimensional (3D) prints cause waste and environmental pollution from the expensive filament material. It is thought that such problems can be prevented by minimizing the waste when the scrap materials generated as a result of each production are recovered. This study investigated the benefits of recycling all possible waste filament specimens, including the supports removed from the part after the defective products or supported production, by granulating and reusing in the production of new parts in the next 3D production process. Mechanical differences between the 3D specimens produced with virgin filaments to be printed with recycled filaments are investigated and it has been determined that most of the countries cause environmental pollution due to the waste of materials including additive manufacturing and 3DP processes. The use of the filament material, which takes a long time to procure from abroad and is mainly procured externally, will be increased from one time to twice or thrice, thus facilitating the availability and preventing environmental pollution.

AB With the enhancement of awareness of environmental protection and sustainable development, reuse of industrial solid waste has gradually attracted people's attention. The utilization of recycled construction powder (RCP) and recycled construction aggregate(RCA)in the production of 3D concrete printable material(3DPM) can not only reduce carbon emissions, but also promote the application of 3D printing technology by reducing material costs. Considering the defect of low-reactivity and inferior property of RCP, the appropriate RCP is screened out according to the modified Andreasen and Andersen model to optimize the gradation of printable materials. Influence of RCP on the fresh property is investigated by rheological experiment and the incipient failure height test. The results show that the addition of 10%RCP would increase the yield stress from 1423Pa to 1573Pa and maintain the viscosity of the material. Moreover, unconfined compressive strength test, isothermal calorimetry and mercury intrusion porosimetry test are also used to characterize the properties of 3DPM. The results show that although the addition of RCP reduces the total heat release of 3DPM, it also reduces the macropore(>1000 nm) of 3DPM from 10.7% to 7.1%, and keep the compressive strength within an acceptable range through the gradation optimization. Finally, the results of laboratory printing or industrial printing also confirm the printing performance of 3DPM.

AB The aim of the study is to present the technique currently used in 3D and 4D printing and add a 5D Printing dimension in the existing printing technique. This study illustrates the ways in which the fifth dimension could be implemented in present printing techniques in various fields. The methodology of study was a combination of review of research artides in 3D printing process, discussion with experts in 3D printing industry, field study to see the industrial applications of 3D printers, investigation of various materials used for 3D printing and documenting the various make-believe ideas of authors which can be implemented. The result of this investigation unearths some materials which have the ability to change shape during printing process, where the shape of an object changes when exposed to different environments. These materials can be termed as smart materials. These materials have helped in the evolution of 4D Printers. The industrial applications of 4D printing make clear that the needs of the future can be catered by the 4D Printed objects by utilizing smart and intelligent materials. The study concludes explaining that morphing is the main characteristics added to a 3D printed object giving rise to 4D printers and further if these shape changing characteristics of 4D printed objects can be controlled either by some sensors or actuators, then it can give rise to 5D printers.

AB 4D printing has attracted tremendous interest since its first conceptualization in 2013. 4D printing derived from the fast growth and interdisciplinary research of smart materials, 3D printer, and design. Compared with the static objects created by 3D printing, 4D printing allows a 3D printed structure to change its configuration or function with time in response to external stimuli such as temperature, light, water, etc., which makes 3D printing alive. Herein, the material systems used in 4D printing are reviewed, with emphasis on mechanisms and potential applications. After a brief overview of the definition, history, and basic elements of 4D printing, the state-of-the-art advances in 4D printing for shape-shifting materials are reviewed in detail. Both single material and multiple materials using different mechanisms for shape changing are summarized. In addition, 4D printing of multifunctional materials, such as 4D bioprinting, is briefly introduced. Finally, the trend of 4D printing and the perspectives for this exciting new field are highlighted.

AB Compared to natural fine aggregate, recycled fine aggregate has disadvantages such as high water absorption and poor strength. Accelerated carbonization is considered a method to enhance recycled aggregate performance. However, the lack of substances available for carbonation reaction in old cement mortar restricts the enhancement of RFA performance. In this study, a presoaked lime -water carbonization method was employed to enhance carbonization efficiency and improve cement mortar performance by introducing additional sources of calcium. Therefore, the focus was on investigating the effects of pre-soaked lime -water carbonization -treated recycled fine aggregate with different replacement ratios (0%, 30%, 50%, 70%, 100%) on the mechanical properties of 3D printed mortar. In addition, combining XRD,SEM-EDS, and X -CT microscale testing methods, the study analyzed the influence of carbonized recycled fine aggregate on the pore structure of 3D printed recycled mortar. The purpose was to reveal the reinforcement mechanism of pre-soaked lime water composite carbonization. Experimental results showed that the pre-soaked lime water carbonization method improved the physical properties of recycled fine aggregate, with the most significant decrease in the water absorption ratio, which decreased by 53.89%. Incorporating appropriate carbonized recycled fine aggregate can enhance the mechanical properties of 3D printed mortar, increase interlayer bonding strength, reduce mechanical anisotropy and overall porosity, and improve pore defects. Defects on the aggregate surface are filled with CaCO3 carbonization products, improving the pore structure and strengthening the interfacial transition zone, thus enhancing the resistance of 3D printed recycled mortar to external forces. The findings of the present work not only improve the utilization of recycled sand but also provide methods and ideas for improving the properties of 3D printed recycled mortar.

AB In the new transformation of 'Industry 4.0', additive manufacturing technologies have become one of the fastest developed industries, with polylactic acid (PLA) playing a significant role. However, there is an increasing amount of garbage generated during the printing process and after prototypes or end-of-life parts. Re-3D printing is one way to recycle PLA waste from fused filament fabrication. To do this process successfully, the properties of the waste mixture should be known. Previous studies have found that PLA degrades hydrolytically, but the time at which this process occurs for 3D printed products is not specified. This work aims to establish the baseline of the degradation kinetics of 3D printed PLA products to predict the service time until which these properties are retained. To achieve this, 3D printed specimens were thermally and hydrothermally aged during several time intervals. Thermal and mechanical properties were also determined. This study reveals that tensile strength decreases after 1344 h of hydrothermal ageing, simulating 1.5-2.5 years of real service time. PLA therefore has the same thermo-mechanical properties before reaching 1.5-years of age, so it could be recycled.

AB In reinforced 3D printed concrete structures, the shear interaction between the rebar and the 3D printed filaments influences both the performance and safety of the concrete structures during service. In this study, the shear performance of the interlayer reinforced interface (IRI) of 3D printed concrete with recycled coarse aggregates (3DPRAC) was investigated, focusing on the pore structure characteristics of the interlayer interface. An enhancement method for the IRI was proposed by varying the number of anchored rebar nails (ARNs) and comparing the results with those of 3D printed concrete with natural coarse aggregates (3DPNAC) and 3D printed mortar (3DPM). The results showed that the ARNs significantly improved the IRI shear strength of 3DPRAC. Specifically, the IRI shear strength of 3DPRAC was 6.1 % lower than that of 3DPNAC but 43.6 % higher than that of 3DPM. By examining the structural characteristics of the rebar-3DPRAC bonding area, a relationship between pore defects and shear strength was established. This established relationship led to the proposal of a partition model for the interlayer bonding interface. A finite element model of 3D printed concrete incorporating real pore structure characteristics was developed to analyze the stress distribution and damage characteristics of the interface under shear stress. The fracture mode induced by local pores with the crack propagation mechanism was also analyzed. Finally, a unified formula for calculating the shear strength of the 3DPRAC IRI was derived based on the principles of virtual work and plastic limit theory. This study provides theoretical support for engineering applications of 3D printed reinforced concrete structures.

AB Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used worldwide for packing, and for this reason, it is the main material in plastic waste. The paper uses granules of recycled PET (R-PET) as raw material for producing filaments for 3D printing, subsequently used for printing the test specimens in different ways: longitudinally and at angles between 10 degrees and 40 degrees in this direction. Both the filaments and the printed specimens experience thermally driven shape memory effect (SME) since they have been able to recover their straight shape during heating, after being bent to a certain angle, at room temperature (RT). SME could be reproduced three times, in the case of printed specimens, and was investigated by cinematographic analysis. Then, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used, in R-PET granules, filaments and 3D printed specimens, to emphasize the existence of glass transition, which represents the governing mechanism of SME occurrence in thermoplastic polymers, as well as a recrystallization reaction. Subsequently, the paper investigated the 3D printed specimens by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) using a dual cantilever specimen holder. Temperature (DMA-TS) and isothermal scans (DMA-Izo) were performed, with the aim to discuss the variations of storage modulus and loss modulus with temperature and time, respectively.

AB With increasing attention on sustainable development, 3D printing construction and recycled concrete have drawn extensive interest as emerging construction technology and novel building materials. At this intersection, we attempted to evaluate the environmental impact and economic benefit of 3D printed buildings made of recycled concrete employing life-cycle assessment tools. Goal and scope definition, materials and scenarios, life-cycle inventory analysis, life-cycle assessment impact, and interpretation were detailed based on the characteristics of concrete 3D printing to better quantify the sustainability potential of recycled concrete used in 3D printed buildings. We found that although increases in using recycled aggregate could produce less pollutant emissions, the environmental impact caused by 3D printing concrete construction is generally larger than traditional cast-in-situ concrete construction. This is because additional cement is required in the 3D printing process to maintain dependable concrete performance. From the economic perspective, 3D printing concrete construction technology has significant advantages over traditional cast-in-situ concrete construction, saving the heavy cost of formwork and labor. Such benefit is even more pronounced in geometrically irregular buildings. We also found that the cost of buildings made of recycled concrete decreased as the proportion of recycled aggregate increased, owing to the higher price of natural aggregate. This paper contributes to identifying key factors in the life-cycle evaluation of 3D printing construction with cementitious materials. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) is an emerging construction technique that extrudes concrete to automatically fabricate structural elements. While prior studies indicate the environmental benefits of 3DPC, limitations include a lack of project-level inventory data and assessment of whole buildings. This study provided a comprehensive framework through a life cycle assessment (LCA) comparison by using 3DPC structures (3DPCS) with project-specific data and conventional masonry structures (CMS) for six-storey residential buildings sharing similar architecture designs. Findings showed that 3DPC reduced cost by 16.9 % due to a 64.1 % decrease in workforce requirements. Environmental impacts were lower by up to 72.5 % for 3DPCS compared to CMS, primarily due to the low-cement-content concrete mixture incorporating recycled aggregates. The research further identified opportunities to enhance the economic and sustainability advantages of 3DPCS versus traditional approaches by increasing the proportion of 3D-printed components and the utilization of 3D printers across different buildings. This empirical research validated 3DPCS sustainability benefits and provided strategies for further promotion of digital concrete techniques in urban and rural construction.

AB Most additive manufacturing technologies, such as 3D printing, utilize support materials in the fabrication process. Beyond the technical challenges of support removal, these materials are wasteful-increasing fabrication and processing time while impacting quality. This paper presents "Freeform Printing", a novel design approach for 3D printing without additional auxiliary structures. A 6-axis KUKA robotic arm is repurposed as a 3D printing platform onto which custom-designed thermoplastic extruders are attached. We demonstrate freeform extrusion using a round nozzle attached to an active air-cooling unit, which solidifies the material upon extrusion. In addition, we present a method for printing geometrically complex structures using a multi-strand extrusion nozzle. The experiments presented in this paper, combined with their evaluation and analysis, provide proof-of-concept for Freeform Printing without support materials. They represent a sustainable approach to additive manufacturing and digital fabrication at large, and point towards new possible directions in sustainable manufacturing.

AB Plastic waste reduction and recycling through circular use has been critical nowadays, since there is an increasing demand for the production of plastic components based on different polymeric matrices in various applications. The most commonly used recycling procedure, especially for thermoplastic materials, is based on thermomechanical process protocols that could significantly alter the polymers' macromolecular structure and physicochemical properties. The study at hand focuses on recycling of polyamide 12 (PA12) filament, through extrusion melting over multiple recycling courses, giving insight for its effect on the mechanical and thermal properties of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) manufactured specimens throughout the recycling courses. Three-dimensional (3D) FFF printed specimens were produced from virgin as well as recycled PA12 filament, while they have been experimentally tested further for their tensile, flexural, impact and micro-hardness mechanical properties. A thorough thermal and morphological analysis was also performed on all the 3D printed samples. The results of this study demonstrate that PA12 can be successfully recycled for a certain number of courses and could be utilized in 3D printing, while exhibiting improved mechanical properties when compared to virgin material for a certain number of recycling repetitions. From this work, it can be deduced that PA12 can be a viable option for circular use and 3D printing, offering an overall positive impact on recycling, while realizing 3D printed components using recycled filaments with enhanced mechanical and thermal stability.

AB PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the potential of using the in-nozzle impregnation approach to reuse recycled PET (RPET) to develop continuous banana fiber (CBF) reinforced bio-composites. The mechanical properties and fracture morphology behavior are evaluated to establish the relationships between layer spacing-microstructural characteristics-mechanical properties of CBF/RPET composite.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses RPET filament developed from post-consumer PET bottles and CBF extracted from agricultural waste banana sap. RPET serves as the matrix material, while CBF acts as the reinforcement. The test specimens were fabricated using a customized fused deposition modeling 3D printer. In this process, customized 3D printer heads were used, which have a unique capability to extrude and deposit print fibers consisting of a CBF core coated with an RPET matrix. The tensile and flexural samples were 3D printed at varying layer spacing.FindingsThe Young's modulus (E), yield strength (sy) and ultimate tensile strength of the CBF/RPET sample fabricated with 0.7 mm layer spacing are 1.9 times, 1.25 times and 1.8 times greater than neat RPET, respectively. Similarly, the flexural test results showed that the flexural strength of the CBF/RPET sample fabricated at 0.6 mm layer spacing was 47.52 +/- 2.00 MPa, which was far greater than the flexural strength of the neat RPET sample (25.12 +/- 1.94 MPa).Social implicationsThis study holds significant social implications highlighting the growing environmental sustainability and plastic waste recycling concerns. The use of recycled PET material to develop 3D-printed sustainable structures may reduce resource consumption and encourages responsible production practices.Originality/valueThe key innovation lies in the concept of in-nozzle impregnation approach, where RPET is reinforced with CBF to develop a sustainable composite structure. CBF reinforcement has made RPET a superior, sustainable, environmentally friendly material that can reduce the reliance on virgin plastic material for 3D printing.

AB The mechanical properties of concrete when subjected to triaxial compression are crucial for designing structures. In this study, environmentally friendly 3D printed recycled mortar (3DPRM) was prepared with recycled sand at 0 %, 50 %, and 100 % replacement rates. The pore structure and mechanical properties of the 3DPRM under triaxial compression, taking into account the influence of replacement rate and anisotropy, were investigated. The results showed that the plane porosity of the 3DPRM specimens was uniformly distributed along the X-direction, while the plane porosity along the Y and Z directions increased at the filament-fusion interface and the layer-fusion interface. Although the incorporation of recycled sand marginally increased the porosity of the specimens, it did not alter the pore structure. During triaxial compression, the strength and confining pressure efficiency of the 3DPRM specimens exhibited significant anisotropy, with the order of strength being X > Y > Z direction. By establishing a multiscale stress equivalence model for typical pores influenced by stress concentration, the mechanism of recycled sand replacement rate affecting the strength of specimens with different directions was revealed. Additionally, a two-stage stress-strain prediction model applicable to different replacement rates and directions was proposed.

AB Additive manufacturing, commonly known as 3D printing, is an advancement over traditional formative manufacturing methods. It can increase efficiency in manufacturing operations highlighting advantages such as rapid prototyping, reduction of waste, reduction of manufacturing time and cost, and increased flexibility in a production setting. The additive manufacturing (AM) process consists of five steps: (1) preparation of 3D models for printing (designing the part/object), (2) conversion to STL file, (3) slicing and setting of 3D printing parameters, (4) actual printing, and (5) finishing/post-processing methods. Very often, the 3D printed part is sufficient by itself without further post-printing processing. However, many applications still require some forms of post-processing, especially those for industrial applications. This review focuses on the importance of different finishing/post-processing methods for 3D-printed polymers. Different 3D printing technologies and materials are considered in presenting the authors' perspective. The advantages and disadvantages of using these methods are also discussed together with the cost and time in doing the post-processing activities. Lastly, this review also includes discussions on the enhancement of properties such as electrical, mechanical, and chemical, and other characteristics such as geometrical precision, durability, surface properties, and aesthetic value with post-printing processing. Future perspectives is also provided towards the end of this review.

AB To overcome the difficulties of placing steel bars in 3D-printed concrete (3DPC), a novel reinforcement method combining engineered cementitious composites (ECC) and recycled fine aggregate concrete (RFAC) was proposed. Experiments on the flexural performance of 3D-printed composite beams with various ECC heights (15, 30, and 45 mm) and shear-span ratios (2.0, 2.5, and 3.0) were carried out. The test results indicated that the beams failed by bending, and the load-bearing capacities with ECC heights of 30 and 45 mm are roughly equivalent to those of the reinforced concrete beams with the longitudinal reinforcement ratios of 0.2%. Subsequently, a finite element model considering printed interfaces was established. The effects of interfacial bond strength, ECC height, and ECC strength on flexural performance were explored through a parametric study. The load-bearing capacity improvement by the increase of ECC height and strength may be limited by the bond strength of the printed interfaces.

AB The recycling of polymeric materials has received a steadily growing scientific and industrial interest due to the increase in demand and production of durable and lightweight plastic parts. Recycling of such materials is mostly based on thermomechanical processes that significantly affect the mechanical, as well as the overall physicochemical properties of polymers. The study at hand focuses on the recyclability of Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) 3D printed Polypropylene (PP) for a certain number of recycling courses (six in total), and its effect on the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts. Namely, 3D printed specimens were fabricated from non-recycled and recycled PP material, and further experimentally tested regarding their mechanical properties in tension, flexion, impact, and microhardness. Comprehensive dynamic scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Raman spectroscopy, and morphological investigations by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were performed for the different 3D printed PP samples. The overall results showed that there is an overall slight increase in the material's mechanical properties, both in tension and in flexion mode, while the DSC characterization indicates an increase in the polymer crystallinity over the recycling course.

AB The mechanical properties and failure criteria of 3D printed concrete under triaxial compression are the basis of calculations for structural design. Incorporating recycled sand into 3D printed concrete can promote early structural formation and has significant environmental benefits. In this study, the pore structures of 3D printed recycled mortar (3DPRM) were characterized by MIP and X-CT tests. The triaxial mechanical properties in the Z-direction were measured at confining pressures of 0, 5, 10, and 15 MPa. The results showed that the incorpo-ration of recycled sand increased the porosity and pore diameter of 3DPRM specimens in various diameter ranges but did not significantly change the sphericity and orientation of the pores. The crack development direction of 3DPRM specimens under triaxial compression depended on both the principal stress direction and the pore structure. The confining pressure increased the strength and compressive toughness of the 3DPRM specimens, and the sensitivity of the 3DPRM specimens to the confining pressure increased with increasing replacement rate. By analyzing the influence mechanism of recycled sand incorporation on 3DPRM strength, a dual deterioration hypothesis based on the pore structure and interface transition zone of 3DPRM was proposed, and the corre-sponding strength model was established.

AB In the past decade, some studies have been reported on the 3D printing of energy storage devices (ESD) by using recycled thermoplastics (such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), polyamide, etc.) through fused deposition modeling (FDM). But hitherto little has been reported on the development of recyclable and flame retardant ESD (by using recycled thermoplastics and thermosetting composite). In this work, efforts were made to 3D print ESD with flame retardant capabilities on FDM by using an ABS-melamine formaldehyde (C4H8N6O) (ABSM) based composite matrix. The components of ESD were prepared in four sections/segments. Three sections were: 3D printed ABSM-based composites reinforced with graphite (Gr), MnO2, and electrolyte (NH4Cl + ZnCl2), and the fourth section was of Zn cast plate. The functional prototype as ESD has been prepared by assembling these four sections. Final observations are supported based upon thermal, mechanical, morphological, flame retardant, V-I, and V-R characterization.

AB Growing in the field of construction, 3D printing allows to build non-standard shapes and to optimise the use of resources. The development of printable materials requires good control of the fresh state of the material-between mixing and printing, a printable material has to evolve from fluid matter to be pumpable (extrudability) up to a matter supporting its own weight and those of superior layers (buildability). Our researches are focused on printable materials used in large printers, i.e., printers able to build structural pieces for buildings. As many pumps and printers can be used to achieve a wide range of parts, this paper presents a simple method to provide valuable guidance to users when a decision needs to be made about printable materials. In this context, our researches both try to maximise the use of industrial by-products to reduce the environmental cost of printed material and to propose tests easy to carry out in the field. Consequently, on the one hand, some printable materials that mainly include quarry washing fines have been developed and, on the other hand, Fall cone and Vicat tests have been used to determine the printability limit. By not focusing on a single formula, the novelty of this paper is to present to readers some parametric models, i.e., a methodology that can be used according to their own devices and applications. Based on a design of experiments, 20 formulas have been tested. Parameters that influence the quality of printing are highlighted. Mechanical tests results at hardened state and shrinkage measurements are also shown to demonstrate the ability of some formulas to be structural materials: compressive strengths at 28 days between 7.50 MPa and 18.40 MPa.

AB In the past two decades, number of studies have been reported on one-way programming (OWP) of virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)-based substrate for sensing applications inform of dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and loss tangent/dissipation factor (tan delta). But hitherto little has been reported on the OWP of primary (1 degrees) recycled ABS (by dielectric tuning of a 3D-printed substrate and mechanical bending to ensure conformal designs). This study reports the OWP of 3D-printed 1 degrees recycled ABS as a sensor (for acetone detection in a distillery, patients with diabetic ketoacidosis as an internet of things (IoT)-based solution). For sensor fabrication, a ring resonator was initially designed using a commercial software package (CST studio suite) and fabricated by 3D printing of 1 degrees recycled ABS for the resonant frequency of 2.45 GHz. Transmission line parameters (S-21) were observed using a vector network analyser (VNA). Further, morphological, radio frequency (RF), current-voltage (I-V), and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) characterisation were performed to understand the effect of two stimuli (acetone and temperature) on ABS substrate for OWP of epsilon(r) and tan delta. Also, the mechanical bending analysis of a one-way programmable substrate was observed for its suitability in sensors miniaturisation.

AB Since the late 1980s, additive manufacturing (AM), commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, has been gradually popularized. However, the microstructures fabricated using 3D printing is static. To overcome this challenge, four-dimensional (4D) printing which defined as fabricating a complex spontaneous structure that changes with time respond in an intended manner to external stimuli. 4D printing originates in 3D printing, but beyond 3D printing. Although 4D printing is mainly based on 3D printing and become an branch of additive manufacturing, the fabricated objects are no longer static and can be transformed into complex structures by changing the size, shape, property and functionality under external stimuli, which makes 3D printing alive. Herein, recent major progresses in 4D printing are reviewed, including AM technologies for 4D printing, stimulation method, materials and applications. In addition, the current challenges and future prospects of 4D printing were highlighted.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a type of rapid prototyping technology known as "additive manufacturing". To meet the stacking layer-by-layer requirements, the fresh materials should have sufficient strength to ensure there is no collapse and plastic flow during the printing process. In addition, the fresh materials should exhibit enough stiffness to resist the intolerable elastic deformation to ensure printing accuracy. Since most of the printed structures have large height-to-thickness ratios, stabilities of printed structures should be taken into account. In this study, we investigated the rheological properties of 3D printed recycled coarse aggregate concrete (RAC), including their rheological behaviors when subjected to shear, the growth pattern of yield stress and shear modulus with resting time. Based on rheological parameters, buildability of RAC with 0%, 50% and 100% replacement rates were evaluated from the perspectives of strength, deformation and stability. It was found that yield stress of RAC exponentially increased with resting time, while the shear modulus linearly increased with resting time. Furthermore, within the first 15 min of printing, RAC exhibited better buildability with increasing replacement rate, however, the open time was shortened. In addition, the relationship between flowability and yield stress of the printing material was evaluated. Compared to the linear relationship of mortar, the relationship between flowability and yield stress was found to be exponential in RAC.

AB The high water absorption level of recycled sand limits the applicability of 3D-printed recycled mortar. In this study, superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) were adopted to modify the properties of both fresh and hardened 3D-printed recycled mortar. The effects of various SAP dosages, particle sizes, and addition methods were carefully examined. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and computed tomography (CT) were adopted to observe the microstructure. The test results showed that the addition of SAP effectively improved the printability of the mixed mortar. Particularly, with the addition of SAP, the autogenous shrinkage was reduced by more than 50 %, indicating that the polymer had an obvious inhibitory effect on shrinkage. Furthermore, the hydration of cementitious materials was promoted, resulting in an increase in compressive strength by 27%-69 %. Microstructural analysis further confirmed that the addition of SAP optimized the pore structure and enhanced the density of the 3D-printed mortar but did not change the types of hydration products. Generally, for the modification of 3D-printed mortar with recycled sand, it would be recommended to add SAP at a doping level of 0.4 % with a particle size of 60-100 mesh.

AB 3D concrete printing has received worldwide attention while the development on new cementitious material compositions for 3D printing is inadequate. This study employed the recycled sand instead of natural sand to achieve 3D concrete printing and investigated the hardened properties of this extrusion-based material. The effect of replacement ratio of recycled sand, curing age, nozzle height and anisotropic behavior were evaluated based on the compressive tests, tensile splitting tests and flexural tests. Moreover, the digital image correlation (DIC) technique was adopted to capture the strain behavior and failure pattern of this layered and printed concrete. Owing to the high un-hydrated cement paste attached to the recycled sand and the internal curing mechanism, the compressive and flexural strengths of the 3D printed concrete with recycled sand were a little lower than those specimens without recycled sand. The compressive, tensile splitting and flexural strength of 3D printed concrete with recycled sand had obvious anisotropy. The replacement of recycled sand had limited effect on the anisotropy of compressive and flexural strength, but had certain effect on the tensile splitting strength. Since recycled sand is one of those major products derived from the construction and demolition waste, it is believed that the employment of recycled sand to the mix of 3D printed concrete will significantly improve the sustainability of 3D printed concrete structures.

AB As the effects of climate change are felt around the world, it is important to consider more sustainable practices in every industry to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and preserve resources. Sustainable practices in the building sector and construction industry include incorporating passive design solutions into the building design and constructing with recycled materials. In this research the main passive design solution considered is thermal energy storage by latent heat capacity of phase change materials (PCMs). Construction with bricks is widely used in the developing world, allowing much potential for the use of recycled brick aggregate in construction composites. This research is the first of its kind on PCM inclusion by aggregate impregnation of recycled brick aggregate in 3D printed concrete (3DPC). Two cavity facade sections are 3D printed using two concrete mix designs - the first, in which 64% of the natural aggregate in the mix is replaced with recycled brick aggregate, and the second, adjusted from the first by an addition of PCM to the pores of the recycled brick aggregate by vacuum impregnation, creating concrete with a total average latent heat capacity of 7360 J/kg. These facade sections are used in four sets of thermal tests in Stellenbosch, South Africa. It is concluded that by latent heat storage, PCM delays heat transfer through the PCM-3DPC passive design facade section, significantly increasing the time that internal ambient temperatures remain within standardised ranges of thermal comfort, and reducing the maximum internal ambient temperatures by up to 3.9 degrees C. Minimal leakage of PCM is proven by effectiveness of the PCM in the PCM-3DPC facade section after five months of exposure to outdoor ambient spring and summer conditions.

ID MODEL; PREDICTION; THICKNESS; STRESS
AB A simplex centroid design method was employed to design the gradation of recycled coarse aggregate. The bulk density was measured while the specific surface area and average excess paste thickness were calculated with different gradations. The fluidity, dynamic yield stress, static yield stress, printed width, printed inclination, compressive strength and ultrasonic wave velocity of 3D printed recycled aggregate concrete (3DPRAC) were further studied. The experimental results demonstrate that, with the increase of small-sized aggregate (4.75-7 mm) content, the bulk density initially increases and then decreases, and the specific surface area gradually increases. The average excess paste thickness fluctuates with both bulk density and specific surface area. The workability of 3DPRAC is closely related to the average excess paste thickness. With an increase in average paste thickness, there is a gradual decrease in dynamic yield stress, static yield stress and printed inclination, accompanied by an increase in fluidity and printed width. The mechanical performance of 3DPRAC closely correlates with the bulk density. With an increase in the bulk density, there is an increase in the ultrasonic wave velocity, accompanied by a slight increase in the compressive strength and a significant decrease in the anisotropic coefficient. Furthermore, an index for buildability failure of 3DPRAC based on the average excess paste thickness is proposed.

AB The interest in sustainable 3D concrete printing (3DCP) has been growing in recent years. One pathway to promoting sustainable 3DCP is replacing natural river sand with recycled glass. Previous research has focused on the rheological and mechanical properties of 3D-printed concrete with recycled glass. However, the correlation between mechanical properties and microstructures were rarely reported. This study investigated the flexural properties of 3D-printed concrete with 50% sand replaced by different gradations of recycled glass through threepoint bending tests. The mid-point load for the bending test was constantly along the direction of layer deposition during 3D printing. Two test conditions were designed, including the beam span parallel and perpendicular to the printing direction, respectively. Microstructural investigations on specimens were carried out through Xray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Experiment results showed the reference mixture without glass exhibited brittle fracture, in contrast to those with glass showing strain softening in the post-peak region. When specimen span was parallel to printing direction, the addition of glass decreased flexural strength by 8% to 20%. mu CT analysis showed the crack propagation was primarily conditioned by the contents and morphology of pores correlated to the addition of glass. However, the addition of glass particles increased flexural strength by 25% to 33% when the beam span was perpendicular to the printing direction. Based on mu CT and SEM analysis, the strength improvement and crack development in this condition was primarily related to the glass particles located alongside the crack path.

AB Delamination of three-dimensional (3D) printed polymer materials by fused deposition modeling (FDM) is a long-standing challenge in additive manufacturing (AM). With numerous efforts devoted to modification of commercially available thermoplastic FDM filaments, developing printing polymeric materials with new chemical design that could intrinsically improve interlayer adhesion, especially combined with other benefits, is in high demand. Herein, we developed a polyurea vitrimer with heat-driven malleability, which is printed to different 3D geometries using FDM. Significantly improved interlayer adhesion was observed by post-annealing the printed samples close to its topology-freezing transition temperature upon which fast associative dynamic covalent bonds exchange reaction occurs. Isotropic mechanical properties were achieved as demonstrated with printed tensile samples with different infill directions. The printed materials could be fully recycled for five generations with retained mechanical properties. Furthermore, the mechanical performance of the printed sample could also be repaired after damage.

AB Centralized waste plastic recycling is economically challenging, yet distributed recycling and additive manufacturing (DRAM) provides consumers with direct economic incentives to recycle. This study explores the technical pathways for DRAM of complex polymer composites using a case study of windshield wiper blades. These blades are a thermoplastic composite made up of a soft (flexible) and hard (less flexible) material. The distributed manufacturing methods included mechanical grinding to fused granular fabrication, heated syringe printing, 3-D printed molds coupled to injection molding and filament production in a recyclebot to fused filament fabrication. The particle size, angle of repose, thermal and rheological properties are characterized for the two sub-materials to define the conditions for the extrusion. A successful pathway for fabricating new products was found and the mechanical properties of the resultant components were quantified. Finally, the means to convert scrap windshield wiper blades into useful, high-value, bespoke biomedical products of fingertip grips for hand prosthetics was demonstrated. This study showed that the DRAM model of materials recycling can be used to improve the variety of solutions for a circular economy.

AB The use of recycled polymers in 3D printing technologies has recently become a promising research topic because of the global concerns on plastic waste pollution and an increase in awareness of sustainability and circularity. In order to unlock the potentials of 3D printing beyond prototyping purposes, continuous fiber-embedded fused filament fabrication (FFF) as a process for composite production has gained importance. This study focuses on the potential use of recycled, glycol-modified poly(ethylene terephthalate) (rPETG) as a matrix material in continuous fiber additive manufacturing of composites. First, the characteristics of rPETG were compared with those of non-recycled PETG in terms of molecular weight as well as rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties. Then, rPETG and PETG composites containing 25% continuous carbon filament (CCF) fibers (CCFs) were printed using a co-extrusion-type FFF printer. Their tensile and flexural properties were characterized. It was found that the tensile properties of rPETG-based composites were lower than those of PET-based composites, but their flexural properties were nearly the same. The thermodynamic work of adhesion approach was applied to understand the interfacial interactions between the matrix and CFF. It was found that the thermodynamic adhesion between rPETG/CFF was higher than that of PETG/CFF. Additionally, SEM-SE images obtained from the fracture surfaces of the samples supported the findings by showing that the adhesion between rPETG and CF was superior to that between PETG and CF. Thus, this study demonstrated that recycled PETG can be used as a possible matrix material for 3D-printed CCF composites, thus highlighting the ability of recycled plastics to be converted into circular products with high added value.

AB Among all three-dimensional (3D) printing materials, thermosetting photopolymers claim almost half of the market, and have been widely used in various fields owing to their superior mechanical stability at high temperatures, excellent chemical resistance as well as good compatibility with high-resolution 3D printing technologies. However, once these thermosetting photopolymers form 3D parts through photopolymerization, the covalent networks are permanent and cannot be reprocessed, i.e., reshaped, repaired, or recycled. Here, we report a two-step polymerization strategy to develop 3D printing reprocessable thermosets (3DPRTs) that allow users to reform a printed 3D structure into a new arbitrary shape, repair a broken part by simply 3D printing new material on the damaged site, and recycle unwanted printed parts so the material can be reused for other applications. These 3DPRTs provide a practical solution to address environmental challenges associated with the rapid increase in consumption of 3D printing materials.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing process. Accordingly, four-dimensional (4D) printing is a manufacturing process that involves multiple research fields. 4D printing conserves the general attributes of 3D printing (such as material waste reduction, and elimination of molds, dies, and machining) and further enables the fourth dimension of products to provide intelligent behavior over time. This intelligent behavior is encoded (usually by an inverse mathematical problem) into stimuli-responsive multi-materials during printing, and is enabled by stimuli after printing. The main difference between 3D- and 4D-printed structures is the presence of one additional dimension, which provides for smart evolution over time. However, currently there is no general formula for modeling and predicting this additional dimension. Herein, by starting from fundamentals, we derive and validate a general bi-exponential formula with a particular format that can model the time-dependent behavior of nearly all 4D (hydro-, photochemical-, photothermal-, solvent-, pH-, moisture-, electrochemical-, electrothermal-, ultrasound-, etc. responsive) structures. We show that two types of time constants are needed to capture the correct time-dependent behavior of 4D multi-materials. We introduce the concept of mismatch-driven stress at the interface of active and passive materials in 4D multi-material structures, leading to one of the two time constants. We develop and extract the other time constant from our unified model of time-dependent behavior of nearly all stimuli-responsive materials. Our results starting from the most fundamental concepts and ending with governing equations can serve as general design principles for future research in the field of 4D printing, where time-dependent behaviors should be properly understood, modeled, and predicted.

AB Vitrimer is a new type of material that combine the advantages of thermoplastic and thermoset materials. The rapid dynamic exchange reactions at high temperature allow the topology of cross-linked networks to change and rearrange while keeping material structures and properties intact. The concept of vitrimer has emerged to provide a viable strategy for the recycling of high-performance polymer materials, and lots of research works have been carried out for the development of various types of vitrimers. In addition, the recycling strategies for vitrimers are particularly important to determine the performance and potential applications of the recovered materials. Therefore, it is an innovative and valuable perspective to discuss vitrimer materials according to their different recycling strategies. In this review, we start with a brief overview of vitrimers, and then, focus on recycling strategies for vitrimers. Specifically, we highlight the advantages and disadvantages of the two different recycling strategies: physical and chemical recycling methods, and then explore the feasibility of upcycling vitrimers using 3D printing technology. Finally, the impact of recycling strategies on vitrimer materials and the prospects for maximizing the use of vitrimer materials are discussed.

AB Over the past few decades, use of geosynthetics has become increasingly common in civil and environmental projects due to their wide range of functions, including stabilization, filtration, separation, and drainage. Meanwhile, the growing volume of plastic waste presents significant environmental challenges such as overflowing landfills, harmful emissions from incineration, and soil pollution. Utilizing recycled plastic for geosynthetic production offers a sustainable solution by reducing reliance on landfills and incineration, thereby mitigating the associated environmental impact of plastic waste. In this paper, innovative and sustainable approaches for stabilizing unpaved roads are examined. The study involves modeling, design, and production of 3D-printed model geogrids made from recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) using a material extrusion 3D printer to create 1:10 scale prototypes, as well as evaluation of their tensile strength through laboratory tests conducted in accordance with ASTM standards. It also investigates field implementation and performance evaluation of an unpaved road stabilized with a new type of composite geosynthetic made from recycled plastic and compares to a similar conventional composite geosynthetic made from virgin plastic-both developed by the geosynthetics industry-and a non-stabilized control test section. This comparison is made through a series of dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP), lightweight deflectometer (LWD), field California Bearing Ratio (CBR) tests, in-situ testing, and visual inspections. The results indicate that composite geosynthetics made from both recycled and virgin plastics show promise in soil stabilization by increasing bearing capacity, strength, and stiffness, while reducing rutting, deformation, and granular base thickness.

AB The advent of additive manufacturing (AM), also often referred to as 3D printing, has enabled the rapid production of parts with complex geometries that are either labor-intensive or unrealizable by traditional manufacturing methods. Many existing 3D printing technologies, however, only allow one material to be printed at one time, while many applications require the integration of different materials, which sometimes cannot be printed by one AM technology. In this paper, a novel multi-material mull-method (m(4)) 3D printer comprised of multiple AM technologies is presented as a solution to the current limitations. This printer fosters the advancement of AM by combining materials traditionally unable to be printed concurrently while adding functionality to printed parts. The m(4) 3D printer integrates four AM technologies and two complementary technologies onto one single platform, including inkjet (IJ), fused filament fabrication (FFF), direct ink writing (DIW), and aerosol jetting (AJ), along with robotic arms for pick-and-place (PnP) and photonic curing for intense pulsed light (IPL) sintering. The integration of these AM technologies and PnP into a single platform allows for rapid fabrication of complex devices, providing a wide range of functionalities with applications ranging from soft robotics and flexible electronics to medical devices.

AB This study explores the incorporation of recycled lightweight aggregates i.e. fly ash cenosphere (FAC) and expanded glass (EG) into 3D-printed cementitious mortar to enhance both thermal insulation and sustainability. The novelty lies in examining how these aggregates impact the mechanical and thermal properties of 3D-printed structures, while also analyzing the pore structure, particularly at the critical interface between successive printed layers. Replacing sand with 60 % FAC (C60) and 65 % EG (G65) resulted in a lightweight mortar with a density of 1800 kg/m3, but also led to reductions in compressive, interlayer bonding, and flexural strength. X-ray microtomography (mu-CT) analysis revealed significant variations in porosity, particularly at the interlayer region where porosity peaked at around 33 %. The thermal conductivity of the printed samples was reduced by up to 58 %, driven by both the lightweight aggregates and the porous interlayer structure. Despite the weakened mechanical properties, the enhanced thermal performance of the 3D-printed samples suggests potential for sustainable, energy-efficient construction. The findings highlight the critical role of pore structure, especially at layer interfaces, in determining the strength and insulation properties of 3D-printed mortars. This work provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between strength and thermal insulation when using lightweight aggregates, offering a pathway to more energy-efficient and sustainable 3D-printed buildings with potential lower operational carbon footprints for 3D-printing construction.

AB Although 3D printing was invented in 1984, it was not until recent years that it captured the imagination of everyone from industry experts to at-home hobbyists. Three-dimensional printing, also known as additive manufacturing or rapid prototyping, constructs an object by accumulating materials layer by layer. In recent years, 3D printing technology has been dramatically developed with respect to materials, printer, and process, which laid a foundation for 4D printing. Four-dimensional printing is the targeted evolution of the 3D-printed structure, concerning shape, property, and functionality. The object is produced by 3D printing firstly. Then, the object can self-deform, self-assemble, self-disassemble, self-repair, and change property or functionality over time when the external stimuli are imposed on it. This review mainly introduces the stimulus, types of shape-shifting behaviors, mechanisms of deformation, and applications of 4D printing.

AB In recent years, additive manufacturing (AM) processes have allowed the building of complex parts and objects with favorable geometric shapes without the need for fabricating special tools. In AM, objects are built layer by layer. Advantages include the possibility of forming complex shapes, reduced waste, no special requirements, and so forth. A critical parameter to consider in AM technologies is the processing (printing) speed, which, if increased, can reduce production (printing) time and expenses. Thus, speeding up the production time in AM has always been paramount. In recent years, fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been extensively developed due to straightforward processing, reliability, and ability to build complex objects and parts from thermoplastic materials. In addition to simplicity, this method has some shortcomings, including low printing speed and instability during the rasters deposition when speeding up the printing process, which is investigated in this study. The results showed that the nozzle height from the work-piece surface and nozzle diameter play a critical role in the process instability. Additionally, there is a critical limit in the formation of molten instability independent of the printing speed. Furthermore, the effect of printing speed on tensile strength was investigated. The results showed that optimizing the nozzle temperature and the extra extrusion multiplier allows printing a high-quality part having optimum tensile and mechanical properties by the maximum printing speed.

AB Since the advent of 3D printing in the mid-1980s, additive manufacturing has grown steadily and found numerous applications across all types of industries. More recently, the industry has seen a spur of growth as the terms of the original patents expired and new companies entered the market. While there exist several different methods of additive manufacturing, polymer-based material extrusion 3D printing (also known as fused filament fabrication) has become one of the most widely used ones due to its lower cost, ease of use, and versatility. While development has greatly expanded the material availability and improved the quality of prints, material extrusion 3D printers have often faced a challenge in physical scaling. There are inherent design hurdles to the extrusion process when the print starts to grow larger. This paper aims to study the market landscape of extrusion-based 3D printing technology for polymer-based material as well as challenges faced in upscaling this technology for industrial applications. A prototype large-scale material extrusion 3D printer has been designed, constructed, and then tested to gain experimental data on large-scale 3D printing using thermoplastic polymers as a printing material. Results of testing and experimentation verified certain key design elements and how they can improve large-scale 3D printing. Testing also revealed how large diameter nozzles for the hot end introduce challenges not seen in small-scale 3D printers. This paper also seeks to consolidate available information pertaining to large-scale 3D printing into one comprehensive document.

AB 3D printing technology has started to take hold as an enabling tool for scientific advancement. Born from the marriage of computer-aided design and additive manufacturing, 3D printing was originally intended to generate prototypes for inspection before their full industrial production. As this field has matured, its reach into other applications has expanded, accelerated by its ability to generate 3D objects with complex geometries. Chemists and chemical engineers have begun to take advantage of these capabilities in their own research. Certainly, the most prominent examples of this adoption have been the design and use of 3D printed reaction containers and flow devices. The focus of this Review, however, is on 3D printed objects, the chemical reactivities of which are of primary interest. These types of objects have been designed and used in catalytic, mechanical, electronic, analytical and biological applications. Underlying this research are the efforts to add chemical functionality to standard printing materials, which are often inert. This Review details the different ways in which chemical reactivity is endowed on printed objects, the types of chemical functionality that have been explored in the various printing materials and the reactions that are facilitated by the final printed object. Finally, the Review discusses new avenues for the development and further sophistication of generating chemically active, 3D printed objects.

AB As an environmentally friendly building material, recycled aggregate has broad application prospects in the digital construction of buildings. In this paper, 3D-printed recycled concrete with the simultaneous incorporation of recycled coarse aggregate and recycled fine aggregate was prepared, and research on its working and mechanical properties was carried out with the type of recycled aggregate and substitution rate as the parameters. The time-varying fluidity loss and yield stress of different recycled aggregate substitution rates were analysed, and the variation trend with the recycled aggregate substitution rate was explored. Its compressive strength and anisotropy were studied, and the mechanism of the influence of different types of recycled aggregates on the compressive strength was analysed in combination with low-field NMR experiments. The results show that the recycled fine aggregate significantly influences the flow properties of 3D-printed recycled concrete. Moreover, its effect is weakened with the recycled coarse aggregate replacement rate increase. The impact of the recycled fine aggregate on the dynamic yield stress was more significant than that of recycled coarse aggregate. In contrast, the opposite was true for the static yield stress; the recycled fine aggregate dominated the influencing factors of extrudability, and the recycled coarse aggregate dominated the influencing factors of constructability. The compressive strength was significantly reduced by either the single or double substitution of recycled aggregates in different printing orientations, with the effect of recycled coarse aggregate being more significant. The pore defect distribution characteristics of the 3D-printed recycled concrete varied with the layer height, and both recycled aggregates increased the porosity to a greater extent. It provides a theoretical reference for research into 3D-printed recycled concrete containing multiple recycled aggregates and its engineering application.

AB The 3D-printed MPA of 1 degrees recycled PVDF and ABS provides an option to develop greener sensors for various engineering applications. But hitherto little has been reported on the comparison of 3D-printed 1 degrees recycled ABS and PVDF-based sensors for body-centric utility in the vicinity of 2.45 GHz. This study highlights the comparative analysis of 1 degrees recycled ABS and PVDF sensors (based on mechanical, piezoelectric, and RF characterization). The study suggests that 1 degrees recycled PVDF (having epsilon(r) 2 and tan delta 0.005)-based sensors have multiband resonance at 2.45 GHz, 5 GHz, and 5.5 GHz with appreciable return loss as compared to ABS (epsilon(r) 3 and tan delta 0.001). For body-centric utility (wearability in terms of SAR value (0.22 W/kg for PVDF and 0.642 W/kg for ABS at 2.45 GHz) and flexibility), 1 degrees recycled PVDF sensor was observed better than 1 degrees recycled ABS. Overall due to better piezoelectric (d(33) 0.5 pC/N), mechanical (MOT 18.30 MPa), and RF characteristics, 1 degrees recycled PVDF-based sensors may be considered a better solution for flexible and pressure-sensitive body-centric applications.

AB 3D printed concrete (3DPC) properties are closely related to the characteristics of coarse aggre-gates and fine aggregates. In this paper, the role of recycled aggregates in 3DPC is considered and the printable inks with different aggregate combinations were well prepared. The mechanical properties of 3DPC containing different aggregates were compared and analyzed, and the effect of recycled aggregates on the development of concrete properties was further investigated under different curing conditions. The results showed that the full recycled aggregate reduced the 3DPC interlayer deformation by 3.1 mm at a height of 120 mm, and the minimum anisotropic compressive strength of it was 16.36 MPa, approximately 67.15% of that of the cast-in-place one. And compared to the full replacement of recycled coarse aggregates, the full replacement of recycled fine aggregates in air curing facilitates the improvement of the mechanical properties of the concrete, with an increase of 4.1 MPa at 28d, but with a negative impact in standard curing. In addition, the reduction in mechanical properties with the combination of fully recycled coarse and fine aggregates is less than the sum of the reduction with the single aggregate, under any type of maintenance or pouring.

AB 3D printing is an ever growing industry that provides many benefits to the advanced manufacturing and design industry. However, parts tend to be static, rigid, and lack multi-purpose use. Recently, a new technology has emerged that uses 3D printing to print parts with the ability to change shape over time when exposed to different external stimuli. This new technology has been called 4D printing. Creation of a new material that is capable of changing shape when exposed to different stimuli and possess the ability to be 3D printed can be a difficult and a long process. Due to this strenuous process, the potential of a common fused deposition modelling material, poly(lactic) acid (PLA), for use in 4D printing is investigated and the concept of combining PLA with nylon fabric for the creation of smart textiles is explored. PLA possesses thermal shape memory behaviour and maintains these abilities when combined with nylon fabric that can be thermomechanically trained into temporary shapes and return to their permanent shapes when heated.

AB Management of waste tires has become a leading environmental issue due to the global growth in the number of tires produced annually. This work is focused on exploring the use of Ground Tire Rubber (GTR) in a new class of cost-effective, recycled composite materials. A Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) desktop 3D printer is used to produce GTR-based composite material with up to 50% wt. rubber filling. ABS is used as the host matrix. Both microscopic and macroscopic characterization of the 3D printed composites are performed in addition to a baseline printed composite. Increasing the rubber content from 0 % wt. to 50 % wt. in the 3D printed GTR-based composite results in approximately 260% improvement in the overall damping properties. Results also indicate the average diameter of the rubber particles in the 3D printed composites increased as the amount of rubber content increased. Presumably, specimens with larger rubber particles yielded longer contact lines with the host polymeric matrix. Consequently, energy dissipation is improved, resulting in enhanced overall damping properties of the 3D printed composites. The enhanced damping capabilities as well as the low-production cost and lightweight characteristics of the presented GTR-filled composite yield new opportunity for application of these GTR-reinforced composites in automotive or other industries for making a wide variety of parts where these characteristics are highly valuable.

ID THERMAL-ENERGY STORAGE; PERFORMANCE; DESIGN; MODEL
AB In this paper the effects of the addition of a paraffin phase change material on the strength and printability of 3D printed concrete are studied. Phase change materials are latent heat storing materials, which garner and release large amounts of energy as they change phase. The addition of phase change materials to concrete produces a composite material with maximised latent and sensible heat storage capacity. Used in buildings, this composite material has the ability to minimise unwanted heat transfer across the building envelope. An existing mix design (RBA-3DPC), in which 64% of the natural aggregate in a 3D printable concrete (3DPC) had been replaced with recycled brick aggregate, is adjusted by adding phase change material to the pores of the recycled brick aggregate by vacuum impregnation, creating PCM-3DPC. Rheological characterisation tests are performed on reference mix designs (3DPC and RBA-3DPC) and the PCM-3DPC mix design, and used in a buildability model to validate the number of printable layers. Mechanical characterisation tests including cube strength tests, direct tensile tests and uniaxial compressive tests are performed on cast and printed specimens of the mix designs. There is no existing research on the effects of the combined addition of recycled brick aggregate and phase change material in 3D printed concrete. It is concluded that the PCM-3DPC has the highest number of printable layers predicted by the model and realised by a cylindrical column print and overall, PCM-3DPC has greater strength compared to RBA-3DPC, and lower strength compared to 3DPC. The PCM-3DPC exceeds the RBA-3DPC interlayer tensile strength by 6%, intralayer compressive strength by 43% and interlayer compressive strength by 9%, and subceeds the 3DPC interlayer tensile strength by 15% and interlayer compressive strength by 13%.

AB The effects of the steel bar direction, steel bar anchorage length, and incorporation of recycled sand and fibre on the bond behaviour of 3D printed concrete specimens were investigated with pull-out tests. The steel bar was placed and covered by multiple printed concrete layers in this study. Compared with mould-cast concrete specimens, the bond failure pattern was similar when the steel bar was pulled out for the 3D printed concrete specimen. However, because the 3D printed concrete specimens had multiple internal interfaces, the probability of splitting failure was higher, and the failure patterns were clearly different. In general, the bond strengths of the 3D printed concrete specimens were lower than those of mould-cast specimens, and there were differences in the bond strength when the steel bars were placed in various directions. Moreover, the modified bond strength model proposed in this study agrees well with the test results and can be used to predict the bond strength between steel bars and 3D printed concrete.

ID 3D; MULTIMATERIAL; SCAFFOLDS; DESIGN
AB 3D printing has been recognized as a disruptive technology for future advanced manufacturing systems. With a great potential to change everything from our daily lives to the global economy, significant advances in 3D printing technology have been made with respect to materials, printers, and processes. In this context, although similar to 3D printing technology, 4D printing technology adds the fourth dimension of time. 4D printing allows a printed structure to change its form or function with time in response to stimuli such as pressure, temperature, wind, water, and light. Recently, rapid advances in printing processes and materials development for 3D printing have allowed the printing of smart materials or multimaterials designed to change function or shape. In this review, we first compare the similarities and differences between 3D printing and 4D printing. We then look into the main factors composing 4D printing technology such as smart materials and designs. Finally, we summarize the current applications of 4D printing.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing technologies are transforming the design and manufacture of components and products across many disciplines, but their application in the construction industry is still limited. Material deposition processes can achieve infinite geometries. They have advanced from rapid prototyping and model-scale markets to applications in the fabrication of functional products, large objects, and the construction of full-scale buildings. Many international projects have been realised in recent years, and the construction industry is beginning to make use of such dynamic technologies. Advantages of integrating 3D printing with house construction are significant. They include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters to meet functional and aesthetic purposes, the reduction in construction waste from highly precise placement of materials, and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, the researchers applied Strand 7 Finite Element Analysis software to a numerical model designed for 3D printing a cement mix that incorporates the recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE). The result: construction of an arched, truss-like roof was found to be structurally feasible in the absence of steel reinforcements, and lab-sized prototypes were manufactured according to the numerical model with 3D printing technology. 3D printing technologies can now be customised to building construction. This paper discusses the applications, advantages, limitations, and future directions of this innovative and viable solution to affordable housing construction.

AB Three-Dimentional (3-D) printing is currently a popular printing technique that is used in many sectors. Potentially, this technology is expected to replace conventional manufacturing in the coming years. It is accelerating in gaining attention due to its design freedom where objects can be produced without imagination boundaries. The review presents a perspective on the application of 3-D printing application based on various fields. However, the ordinary 3-D printed products with a single type of raw often lack robustness leading to broken parts. Improving the mechanical property of a 3-D printed part is crucial for its applications in many fields. One of the promising solutions is to incorporate nanoparticles or fillers into the raw material. The review aims to provide information about the types of additive manufacturing. There are few types of raw materials can be used as foundation template in the printing, enhanced properties of the printed polymer nanocomposites with different types of nanoparticles as additives in the printing. The article reviews the advantages and disadvantages of different materials that are used as raw materials or base materials in 3-D printing. This can be a guideline for the readers to compare and analyse the raw materials prior to a decision on the type of material to be selected. The review prepares an overview for the researchers to choose the types of nanoparticles to be added in the printing of the products depending on the targeted application. With the added functionality of the 3-D polymer nanocomposites, it will help in widespread of the application of 3-D printing technology in various sector.

AB Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is commercially being used for making food containers, soft drink bottles, etc., and is one of the large contributors to municipal solid waste. One of the solutions to address this issue is the use of recycled PET in some high-end products which may add value to this waste. This study focuses on using primarily recycled PET which has been used to 3D print substrates with fused deposition modeling set up for fabrication of sensors. In this study, after ascertaining the rheological, mechanical, and morphological properties of selected PET waste, a ring resonator was fabricated followed by the fabrication of 3D printed substrates of various infill densities (33%, 50%, 100%). Further vector network analyzer was used to explore sensing capabilities of prepared microchip antenna. The results obtained for recycled PET were compared (at 100% infill density) based upon dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) as 2.34, with commercial thermoplastics (such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) (epsilon(r) 2.59), ninja flex (epsilon(r) 2.90), and nylon (epsilon(r) 1.02). The result of the study outlined that recycled PET-based sensors are one of the suitable alternatives for better sensing applications.

AB The presence of recycled plastic materials for the 3D printing process expects that the production process will be more environmentally friendly and solve the problem of plastic waste globally. However, recycled plastic as a filament material in the 3D printing process is still limited. One of the ways to make recycled plastic filaments is by extrusion. This research aims to optimize the extrusion process parameters in the manufacture of recycled plastic filaments (Polypropylene) that have never been conducted before. The extrusion process was analysed using the Taguchi and ANOVA methods. The results of this study indicate that the spooler speed of 4 rpm, extrusion speed of 40 rpm, and extrusion temperature of 200 degrees C in the parameter setting produce an average filament diameter of 1.6 mm. However, filaments made from Recycled Plastic (Polypropylene) have a rough and easily curved surface, so further research is needed.

AB The 3D printing of thermoplastic polymers (both virgin and reinforced with metal/ceramic particles) has been widely explored in recent past with fused deposition modelling (FDM) process. But hitherto very little has been reported on 3D printing of thermoplastics polymers with reinforcement of thermosetting polymers and ceramic particles. This article is an extension of work reported on thermo-mechanical investigations on waste thermosetting polymer bakelite and ceramic (silicon carbide and aluminium oxide) as reinforcement in recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) thermoplastic matrix for sustainability. The study reports the experimental investigations on mechanical (tensile), morphological, surface hardness and thermal stability analysis of 3D printed functional prototype as tensile specimen (as per ASTM D 638). In the present case study, it has been ascertained that composition/proportion of thermoplastic matrix has a significant role in controlling the mechanical properties, whereas other input process parameters of FDM are insignificant. The results of the study suggest that thermosetting and ceramic-reinforced ABS thermoplastic-based 3D printed parts have mechanical properties at par with unreinforced ABS.

AB The flexural properties of 3D printed concrete specimens with recycled sand reinforced by polyethylene (PE) fibres were investigated through four-point bending tests in this research. The use of recycled sand reduced the flexural stiffness and strength of 3D printed specimens loaded in various directions. From curing ages of 7 d to 14 d, the flexural strength and fracture energy of the specimens increased significantly, while the improvements from 14 d to 28 d were relatively limited. By adding PE fibres into the mix, the negative impact of adding recycled sand can be compensated, and the flexural strength of the 3D printed specimen can be obviously improved. Scanning electron microscopy results showed that the loose old cement paste attached to the recycled sand resulted in the higher porosity of the 3D printed specimens with recycled sand compared to that with only natural sand. The mechanical properties of 3D printed concrete specimens can be effectively improved by the strong interfacial bonds between the fibres and the matrix and the high tensile strength of the fibres. In practical applications, if the deformation and stiffness requirements are not strict, the replacement ratio of recycled sand can be increased if an appropriate fibre content is included.

AB 3D printed concrete (3DPC) has become increasingly popular in the last decade. However, the mechanical and microstructural evolution of the 3DPC under extremely high-temperature environments has not been fully understood. The purpose of this study is to experimentally investigate the influence of recycled sand and polyethylene (PE) fiber on the mechanical properties and pore structure of the 3DPC under high temperatures. A series of compressive, flexural, and CT scanning tests were conducted for 3DPC specimens under 20 degrees C, 200 degrees C, 400 degrees C, 600 degrees C, and 800 degrees C, respectively. It shows that there is a similar degradation trend of the compressive and flexural strengths of 3D printed and mold-casted specimens with the same mixture at elevated temperatures. 3DPC specimens delaminated through the interface between layers and strips in the layer at 600 degrees C and 800 degrees C, respectively, due to the weak adhesion between layers and strips. The addition of recycled sand and PE fiber into the 3DPC could modify its pore structure and mitigate the risks of explosive spalling.

AB This study focused on the plastic shrinkage and cracking of 3D printed mortar mixed with recycled sand as fine aggregates. The test methods for free and restrained plastic shrinkage were designed and improved to simulate the plastic shrinkage of 3D printed mortar. The shrinkage and the development of cracks under constraints were measured by image processing, and the effect of recycled sand was evaluated. 3D printed natural sand mortar and 3D printed recycled sand mortar with replacement ratios of 25%, 50%,75%, and 100% were tested and analyzed. Results showed that the plastic shrinkage of the 3D printed mortar increased with the increase of recycled sand content. With the higher replacement ratio of recycled sand, the plastic cracking of 3D printed mortar under restraint conditions showed a higher cracking depth. It can be concluded that the 3D printed mortar mixed with recycled sand shows a minor plastic shrinkage rate under a 50% replacement ratio. When a 100% replacement ratio of recycled sand is reached, the 3D printed recycled sand mortar needs additional consideration of shrinkage compensation design to avoid early-age cracking in the plastic stage.

AB The demand for UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) has drastically increased within the past few years, with proven efficiency for remote sensing use. This paper analyses the feasibility of utilizing recycled plastics from bottles such as, Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) as 3D printing filament, in order to rapidly print foldable UAV airframes for remote sensing use. Previous work has failed to effectively address the process of 3D printing UAVs with a lack of literature pertaining to the ability of 3D printing UAVs with recycled materials and the environmental effects associated with this. To address this issue, this paper presents results analyzing the material properties of commonly used 3D printing filaments with that of the recycled filament, which has proven to be effective in use for this application. This new approach in manufacturing UAVs is expected to significantly benefit the low-cost manufacturing of UAVs, reducing the time taken to obtain UAVs, expanding the operational scope of these systems all whilst reducing the detrimental effects to the environment without any loss of functionality.

AB Fused particle fabrication(FPF)(or fused granular fabrication(FGF)) has potential for increasing recycled polymers in 3-D printing. Here, the open source Gigabot X is used to develop a new method to optimize FPF/FGF for recycled materials. Virgin polylactic acid(PLA) pellets and prints were analyzed and were then compared to four recycled polymers including the two most popular printing materials(PLA and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS)) as well as the two most common waste plastics(polyethylene terephthalate(PET) and polypropylene(PP)). The size characteristics of the various materials were quantified using digital image processing. Then, power and nozzle velocity matrices were used to optimize the print speed, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for a given polymer feedstock. ASTM type 4 tensile tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of each plastic when they were printed with a particle drive extruder system and were compared with filament printing. The results showed that the Gigabot X can print materials 6.5 x to 13 x faster than conventional printers depending on the material, with no significant reduction in the mechanical properties. It was concluded that the Gigabot X and similar FPF/FGF printers can utilize a wide range of recycled polymer materials with minimal post processing.

AB One of the technical challenges for the extrusion-based 3D printed concrete is that the requirements of green strength development are much different from ordinary concrete, due to the absence of formwork. This study employed the recycled sand into the mix of 3D printed mortar and explored the green strength development at early ages within 2.5 h after extrusion. 25% and 50% natural sand was replaced by recycled sand which was crushed from waste concrete in the mix. Uniaxial unconfined compressive tests were undertaken to obtain the mechanical properties of the printable mortar, while the failure patterns, vertical load-displacement relationship, lateral deformation and stress-strain behavior were recorded and fully analyzed. It is found that the recycled sand had very limited influence for those immature specimens, while exerted significant effect on the early age behavior for those mature specimens. The addition of recycled sand will change the mortar from plastic material to solid material, especially when the rest time reaches 90 min after the extrusion. It is believed that the high cement paste content and large water absorption of recycled sand in the 3D printed mortar affects the early age behavior. Since the incorporation of recycled sand improves the buildability while reduces the open time of the printed material, it is necessary to reasonably adjust the mix ratio and the amount of recycled sand in practical printing.

AB The purpose of this project is to recycle the 3D printing waste material into a useful filament by using an extruder machine. The study focuses on forming a new filament by using recycled Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) from product waste. The recycled filament is then utilized to an open-source 3D printing to create a specimen. The investigation of its mechanical properties is done by comparing the tensile strength, tensile strain, maximum load, and modulus young to pure ABS material data. The result shows the original ABS specimen can withstand a 724N maximum load while recycled ABS specimen can accept 713N.

AB The authors first report the three-dimensional (3D) structured CeO2-PLA scaffold using a 3D printing methodology. The scaffold is prepared by decorating functional metal-oxide nanoparticles onto the 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA) platform via an electrostatic interaction and is applied to the applications for photochemical degradation. As-designed CeO2-PLA scaffold shows high photocatalytic degradation performance toward methyl orange under a light irradation. Furthermore, the CeO2-PLA scaffold shows reasonable degradation performance even after it is washed and reevaluated; this result demonstrates the benefit of 3D-printed CeO2-PLA scaffold that it can be recycled several times without losing the catalysts.

AB This research seeks to overcome the printing and processing challenges of using waste polypropylene (PP) reinforced with short basalt fibres, transforming them into upcycled feedstock for additive manufacturing. It introduces an optimised method for producing filaments and 3D printing with these materials, addressing common issues such as adhesion and warpage through innovative techniques while achieving maximum mechanical performance in the resulting composites. Basalt fibre weight fractions of 0 %, 2 %, 5 %, 8 %, 15 %, 30 %, and 50 % were used to reinforce the recycled polypropylene, improving both printability and mechanical properties. The tensile strength reached 53.58 MPa at 15 % fibre content, while the flexural strength peaked at 34.06 MPa with 30 % fibre content, revealing distinct interactions between the fibres and polymer under tensile and flexural loading that were not previously observed. Microstructure, voids, debonding, and dispersion were examined using optical and scanning electron microscopy. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was performed to assess the thermal behaviour and crystallinity of the recycled polymer during filament production and printing, revealing slight matrix degradation during these processes. The findings highlight the potential of waste basalt fibre-reinforced PP as a valuable filament feedstock for 3D printing, supporting a circular economy approach to composite manufacturing.

AB Environmental sustainability has been the focus of recent construction trends. Adopting efficient construction technologies and minimizing the usage of raw materials are a few of many ways to achieve such sustainability. In the past few years, 3D printing of concrete has received considerable attention for its potential to be the next disruptive technology for construction industry. By eliminating and/or reducing the amount of in-situ construction, combined with the need for skilled personnel, 3D printing can help in achieving good quality control at construction site, which has long been an issue in traditional construction industry. Singapore is dependent on neighboring countries for raw construction materials. Using recycled materials as a substitute for aggregates not only minimizes the usage of raw materials, but also help in reducing the Singapore's dependency on other countries in long-term. In this study, preliminary findings of a 3D printed cementitious material with recycled glass aggregates (RGA) were presented. For 3D printing two different binder systems were used - ternary blended Portland cement and flyash based geopolymer.

AB Digital Light Processing (DLP) 3D printing has emerged as a highly promising technique, enabling the fabrication of intricate geometric structures with ease and precision, without the need for complex mold-making processes. However, the printed objects are typically crosslinked photopolymers that cannot be reshaped, reprocessed and recycled. Herein, we successfully synthesize a dynamic soft polymer crosslinker containing hindered urea bonds (HUBs) composed of polyurethane acrylate prepolymer and tri-functional for recyclable DLP 3D printing. Contributing to the dynamic thermal response of HUBs, the printed objects can be recycled in the initial printing inks at 80 degrees C in 2h and the obtained recycled ink can be reprinted by DLP achieving a low viscosity and high printing resolution. In addition, the printed objects can be reprocessed by hot-press at 110 degrees C for 30 min upon a pressure of 5 MPa. By a reasonable proportion of monomer and crosslinker, a series of photocured elastomers were successfully prepared, in which mechanical properties could be tailored by changing the content of the crosslinker. The resulting products exhibited some fascinating attributes, such as excellent fatigue resistance, thermodynamic stability, and transparency. Significantly, the resin can regain initial 3D printing capability after undergoing solvent recycling, which maintains its printing resolution and excellent mechanical properties. This innovative design strategy not only alleviates environmental impact but also plays a pivotal role in developing the DLP 3D printing industry by tackling the long-standing issue of resin recyclability.

AB This work intends to provide a preliminary approach concerning the preparation of 3D printed products derived from recycled raw-materials. In that sense, recycled polyurethane foam (PUF) particles were added (up to 10% wt/wt) to thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) to prepare 3D printed products. From the results, it was observed that the presence of PUF particles reduces the density of filaments. Moreover, even though filler and matrix are polyurethane (PU) polymers, the fact that PUF scraps consists of crosslinked PU, it affects inter-layer adhesion, reducing the mechanical performance of the 3D printed specimens, especially when high PUF particles contents were used. Nonetheless, despite of the limitations identified, the addition of PUF particles did not affect the thermal stability of the composites, meaning that these composites can be processed at high temperatures. Therefore, PUF scraps were successfully reused which proved to be a low cost additive for the production 3D printed composites (when using low content), with the advantage of being an alternative to the disposal of PUF.

AB Additive manufacturing is a technology that creates objects by adding successive layers of material. The 3D method is an alternative to subtractive production, in which production involves removing material from the initial solid. 3D printing requires the initial design of the manufactured object using computer design, for example, one of the following programs: CAD, 3DCrafter, Wings 3D, Cinema 3, Blender, 3ds Max, Autodesk Inventor, and others. It is also possible to scan an existing object to be manufactured using 3D printing technology. An important element of Industry 5.0 is 3D printing technology, due to its favorable environmental orientation and production flexibility. Three-dimensional printing technology uses recycled materials such as powders. Therefore, it can be part of a circular economy, contributing to environmental protection. Additive manufacturing not only complements existing technologies by enabling rapid prototyping but also plays a fundamental role in sectors such as dentistry and medicine. This article consists of seven chapters relating to various aspects of 3D printing technology in the context of the assumptions and challenges of Industry 5.0. It examines the environmental impact and recycling potential of 3D printing technology, illustrates the economic integration of this technology within various industries, and discusses its future development prospects.

AB The study focuses on the mechanical performance of a blend of ocean-recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) and polypropylene (rPP) and explores the effect of adding burlap biocarbon from post-industrial waste as a filler. This study aims to upcycle ocean-recycled plastic and post-industrial waste and to compare the conventional injection molding with 3D printing. The Taguchi-gray relational analysis was utilized to determine the preferred printing conditions for both the rHDPE-rPP blend and the rHDPE-rPP-biocarbon composite. The study found that the preferred printing conditions for the rHDPE-rPP blend were a raster angle of 0 degrees, a printing speed of 900 mm/min, and a nozzle temperature of 215 degrees C, while the preferred printing conditions for the rHDPE-rPP-biocarbon composite were a raster angle of 0 degrees, a printing speed of 1200 mm/min, and a nozzle temperature of 255 degrees C. The study also compared the mechanical properties of 3D printed and injection-molded samples, with the 3D printed rHDPE-rPP blend samples, demonstrating higher tensile and flexural moduli with a percent increase of 7 and 12%, respectively, compared to the injection-molded counterparts. However, no considerable difference in tensile and flexural modulus was observed between 3D printed and injection-molded samples of the rHDPE-rPP-biocarbon composite. Moreover, it was also found that the addition of biocarbon resulted in an enhancement in the tensile and flexural modulus of the optimized 3D printed specimen with an increase of 17 and 5%, respectively. However, both the 3D printed rHDPE-rPP blend and rHDPE-rPP-biocarbon composite exhibited a decrease in impact strength of 63 and 23%, respectively, compared to the injection-molded counterparts.

AB Hailed since the fourth industrial revolution, three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing ( AM) has been extensively implemented in various manufacturing sectors. This process is popular for generating regular products and incorporating innovative designs into the components like auxetic structures, such as fabrication of engineering products, customized implants and sophisticated biomedical devices. Over the years, one of the interesting outputs of this emerging technology is the reuse of waste thermoplastic materials to produce competent products through the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. The strength of FDM components produced from thermoplastic waste is lower than that of virgin plastic FDM counterparts. So, there is a need to understand the significant changes in the recycled thermoplastic material during subsequent extrusions, which are chain scission, change in viscosity and breaking strength. The use of additives has been a promising solution to improve the performance of recycled material for 3D printing applications. Hence, this study aims to provide an overview of reusing plastic waste through FDM-based 3D printing. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the effect of processing on thermo-mechanical properties of recycled plastic FDM parts and the use of various additives to improve the overall quality. In addition, two case studies from open literature have been demonstrated to explain the use of FDM and associated technology for plastic recycling.

AB Plastic prototypes that are produced by a low cost 3d printing process may contribute to the increases of plastic waste due to its post-process or from the waste from prototype building error. In this paper, with the goal to sustain and reuse the plastic waste, a recycle system which integrated to the low cost 3Dprinter was proposed. This system concept which consisted of 13 parts was designed and analyzed by computer modelling and computer aided engineering software. Afterwards, most parts were built by 3D printer before they were assembled together and attached to the low cost 3D printer in order to prove the working design concept. From the result of the analysis, it shows that all parts were safe to produce where the factor safeties were in the range of 3 to 10 and the working concept of the system was proven.

AB This study investigates the weathering resistance of three polypropylene grades (impact-resistant, recycled and UV-stabilized) processed by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), injection and thermo-compression. Samples undergo accelerated aging, simulating conditions equivalent to six months in tropical environments with high hydrothermal and UV exposures. They are characterized by chemical, thermal, rheological, mechanical and microstructural analyses. 3D-printed impact-resistant and UV-stabilized PP resist to the considered aging conditions, attributed to the presence of stabilizers. On the contrary, the properties of recycled PP deteriorate over time due to low stabilizer concentration and the presence of impurities post-recycling. Samples processed by thermo-compression and injection display lower aging resistance compared to their 3D-printed counterparts, due to degradation and alteration in the crystalline structure induced by the processing method, like the 'skin effect' observed in injection. These findings highlight the importance of re-stabilization during recycling and the potential of 3D-printing for enhancing the aging resistance of polypropylene.

AB In the past two decades, several studies have been reported on the 3D printing of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) based functional prototypes (of amorphous nature) using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. It has been reported that the reinforcements (commercial metallic powders) result in the tuned crystalline behaviour of the ABS matrix, leading to compromised 3D printing capabilities. This study highlights the fabrication of secondary (2 degrees) recycled ABS filament with reinforcement of burnt incense stick powder waste (ISPW) for acceptable thermo-mechanical properties and 3D printing capabilities. The reinforcement of ISPW (0.75% by wt.) in ABS was selected based on the rheological and mechanical properties. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results show an improvement in crystallinity (from 28.5 to 34.9%) with a minor change in mechanical strength (from 29.8 MPa to 29.47 MPa) in the ABS-0.75%ISPW composite. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis outlined that glass transition temperature (Tg) was improved (from 94.97 degrees C to 105.27 degrees C) for the prepared composite. The results were also validated through Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis.
   This study highlights the fabrication of 2 degrees recycled ABS filament with reinforcement of burnt ISPW for acceptable thermo-mechanical properties and 3D printing capabilities.

AB The utilization of waste materials in emerging 3D concrete printing technology offers a sustainable solution to mitigate environmental issues. Glass waste, being one of the largest sources of waste globally, can be recycled to reduce its environmental impact. This study aims to investigate the effect of partially replacing glass waste powder with the precursor in geopolymerization for 3D concrete printing. The 3D printable geopolymer concrete containing 10% and 30% glass waste as a replacement to FA was developed and printed using the concrete 3D printer. After 28 days, the hardened properties of the resulting samples, including compressive strength in longitudinal, lateral, and perpendicular directions, as well as the apparent volume of permeable voids, were measured. The test results revealed that the porosity of the 3D printed samples increased with the glass waste powder content, along with the decreased compressive strength.

AB We are developing a Multi Material 3D printer to print an object with different kind of soft and hard material in a single run. It is expected that the combination of printing soft and hard material will be a new kind of 3D printer. Our main printing material is conductive based soft filament made by our laboratory "Soft & Wet Matter Engineering Laboratory", other different soft filament and hard plastic filament to create fully functional, multi material objects in a single printing run with greater variety and lower cost than other single material printing. In addition, we are developing a special type of Extruder, by using this we will be able to print both soft and hard material with one printer. This will be a new era of 3D printer. Such kind of 3D printer will possibly be a good STEM tool in medical sector and robotics.

AB One key challenge preventing commercially viable domestic recycling lies in the gap between the high costs of the recycling process and the limited value of recycled raw materials. While additive manufacturing (AM) has the potential to narrow such a gap by converting waste materials into value-added products through the remanufacturing process, the ink formulation for waste materials remains a formidable task due to poor processability. In contrast to high-temperature metallurgy (1000-2000 K), a facile approach is developed to convert waste metals (e.g., stainless steel machining chips) into printable and stable inks for 3D-printed electronics at near room temperature. Moreover, the binder chemistry and percolation mechanism are studied, enabling sustainable ink formulation with non-toxic solvents and environmentally benign polymers (i.e., no fluorinated polymer). The ink formulation is generalizable for various functional materials, including other metals, carbons, and clays. As a proof of concept, a 3D-printed strain sensor from recycled stainless steel (SS) chips is demonstrated, which is shown to effectively identify even minor strains from the human body, highlighting potential wearable applications.

AB Material Extrusion Additive Manufacturing of Metals (sinter-based metal 3D printing) is the future of metal additive manufacturing as the technology is accessible, easy-to-use and affordable. This method typically starts by using high loading metal-polymer composites/filaments as the feedstock. The rheological behavior of composite affects the maximum metal content of the feedstock, and is influenced by type of components, filler shape and size distribution, as well as additives. In this study, highly filled metal-polymer filaments, with 75 wt% nickel content dispersed in polylactic acid (PLA) matrix have been made for the first time by using a simple single-screw extruder. Using biodegradable PLA alongside recycled nickel powders, which are produced by low-carbonfootprint Mond process, take steps towards affordability and sustainability considerations. Microstructure, rheological, mechanical, and thermal properties of feedstock filaments and 3D printed parts were evaluated. Printing parameters were also optimized, and the results showed that increasing the flow rate by 10 % enhances the overall quality of the printed part and reduces the gap between the 3D printed lines. The preliminary studies on debinding/sintering post heat treatments to get fully dense nickel parts also showed promising results using the developed methodology.

AB Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is an advanced 3D printing technique for the manufacture of plastic materials. The ease of use, prototyping accuracy and low cost makes it a widely used additive manufacturing technique. FDM creates 3D structures through the layer-by-layer melt-extrusion of a plastic filament. The production of a printed structure involves the generation of a digital design of the model by 3D design software and its execution by the printer until the complete model is reproduced. This review presents the current status of FDM, how to handle and operate FDM printers, industry standards of printing, the types of filaments that can be used, the postprocessing treatments, advantages, and limitations as well as an overview of the increasing application fields of FDM technology. The application areas of FDM are endless, including biomedicine, construction, automotive, aerospace, acoustics, textiles, and occupational therapy amongst others. Even during the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, FDM has helped to fabricate face masks, ventilators and respiratory systems, respiratory valves, and nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis. FDM 3D and 4D printing can produce polymeric and composite structures of various designs, and compositions in a range of materials according to the desired application. The review concludes by discussing the future prospects for FDM.

AB The application of additive manufacturing (AM) in construction has been increasingly studied in recent years. Large robotic arm- and gantry-systems have been created to print building parts using aggregate-based materials, metals, or polymers. Significant benefits of AM are the automation of the production process, a high degree of design freedom, and the resulting potential for optimization. However, the building components and 3D-printing processes need to be modeled appropriately. In this paper, the current state of AM in construction is reviewed. AM processes and systems as well as their application in research and construction projects are presented. Moreover, digital methods for planning 3D-printed building parts and AM processes are described.

TI Effects of corn husk fiber as filler in recycled single-use
   polypropylene for fused filament fabrication
SO JOURNAL OF VINYL & ADDITIVE TECHNOLOGY

DT Article
DE 3D printing; corn husk fiber; fused filament fabrication; recycled
   polypropylene
AB Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is one of the most popular 3D printing approaches among end-users due to its lower cost, ease of operation, and wide range of material choices. However, the use of composite filament produced from recycled plastic and agriculture waste is still relatively uncommon. This research focuses on developing composite filament from corn husk fiber (CHF) and recycled single-use polypropylene for FFF. In this work, neat recycled polypropylene (rPP) and rPP/CHF composites were extruded into filament for FFF printing. It was observed that increasing the CHF content would reduce the print quality of the parts, as visible air gaps and voids were found on the printed surface and within the layers. Nevertheless, these issues were able to be overcome by adjusting the printing temperature and increasing the extrusion percentage during the printing process. The melt flow index results indicate that a higher CHF content would reduce the melt flow of the extruded rPP/CHF composite during printing, potentially affecting the quality of the printed parts. On the other hand, increasing the temperature enhanced the melt flow of the composite, which was beneficial for the printing process. When a small amount of CHF was added to the rPP, the printed part exhibited the highest tensile strength due to the reinforcing effect of the fibers. However, the tensile strength of printed parts using rPP/CHF composite filament decreased with higher CHF content. Additionally, higher CHF content resulted in printed composite parts that were more rigid and stiffer. It also reduced warpage on the printed specimens made with this composite, but it is important to note that warpage of the printed specimen is not directly correlated to crystallinity caused by nucleating effect of CHF. The rPP/CHF composite filament did exhibit earlier thermal degradation due to the addition of more CHF. However, this should not affect the printing process when temperature not beyond 230(degrees)C. This study highlights the potential of utilizing single-use PP and fibers extracted from corn husk as feedstock for 3D printing. The findings expand the possibilities for recycling and employing agricultural waste in sustainable additive manufacturing processes.

AB Additive manufacturing is accelerating in hypersonic speed, which touched upon almost all the nook and corners of the manufacturing sector. The present stage wherein a 3D printer is capable of printing queer hybrid materials was not imagined through conventional manufacturing albeit it is meager existence in a few instances. Its expendable arms stretch to the maximum level that is even clearly addressed in Industry 4.0 too, by making at least a printer in a company for printing specific customized materials. The dream of printing composite material was been a long-term goal for researchers worldwide. This article primarily focuses on this niche area of printing natural fiber composite materials that too specifically jute fiber-reinforced composites. Very few pieces of literature are available on additive manufacturing of specific natural fibers. As the technique for printing natural fiber-reinforced composites is still under evolution, this study will be more interesting as it consolidates the facts and figures involved in 3D of jute fiber reinforced composites alone. Different forms of jute fibers used by the researchers include weaved jute, jute as continuous fiber, filament along with jute, jute fiber as reinforcement, jute used as rope as well as jute fiber as cement matrix and all these forms have been addressed in this review.

AB Improving the built quality of printed objects is commonly tackled from a material composition or manufacturing processing perspective, but mechanics also play a critical role in controlling performance of the printed parts. In this study, we investigate lattices that are manufactured with recycled PLA (Polylactic Acid) using a mechanicsguided approach, which assigned optimal printing parameters to specific struts according to a possible tensile, compressive, and flexural stress state. We identify the optimal combinations of nozzle temperature, printing speed, and layer heights using standard test specimens for each loading scenario, The strengths of specimens with optimal parameters are up to 23% higher than those with default parameters. Guided by simulations and experiments, we then compared the compressive strength and energy absorption of recycled PLA lattices fabricated by programmable printing parameter sets against those with default parameter sets without considering mechanical features. Strength and energy-absorbing ability can be improved by up to 25.52% and 140.22% respectively. Overall, we validate the role of mechanics in fabricating a 3D-printed object and envision that our approach is universal and applicable to improving the mechanical properties of any given geometries printed by other methods and with other base materials.

AB The additive manufacturing (AM) process, also known as 3D printing, is a process of layer-by-layer material deposition to produce desired parts from 3D model data, as opposed to formative manufacturing methodologies and subtractive manufacturing processes. The AM is one of the most well-suited manufacturing technologies for the aerospace industry where lightweight and unique-shaped components are demanded as this technology produces lightweight and cost-efficient aircraft components with unique geometries. The AM also allows manufacturers to release products with a smaller number of components onto the market; enabling rapid prototyping with less material waste compared to subtractive manufacturing processes. Therefore, during the last two decades, this technology has received research interest and has been adopted by the aerospace industry, resulting in a significant AM market share compared to other sectors. The aerospace industry has been one of the dominant sectors of the global AM market and is forecasted to be one of the leading contributors to the rapidly changing and competitive global AM market. This study reviews the assessment of the recent and forecasted future global aerospace AM market, linked with the historic and forecasted data, and the adoption of this technology, historic and forecasted global aerospace AM market trends, and the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the current state of the global aerospace sector. Related charts based on historic and forecasted data are given to summarise the global AM market trends and assessment of AM potential for the aerospace industry in this study.

AB This paper aims to conduct a comparative analysis between commercially available virgin and recycled ABS filaments of parts printed by Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology as well as to provide information on the differences in performance of both materials for 3D printing. Material characterization methods (FTIR, TGA, DSC and DMA), FFF for the manufacture of specimens and mechanical tensile and impact tests were used to determine the characteristics of each printed material. The study showed small differences in composition and mechanical behavior between the two materials. The main finding was that Virgin ABS had higher impact resistance. In addition, the recycled material behaved more unstable during the 3D printing process. The results showed some differences between the two materials, virgin ABS proved to be much more resistant to impact. In addition, recycled ABS displayed a little more sensitive behavior to temperature and humidity when compared to virgin ABS.

AB 3D printing, formally known as additive manufacturing, creates complex geometries via layer-by-layer addition of materials. While 3D printing has been historically perceived as the static addition of build layers, 3D printing is now considered as a dynamic assembly process. In this context, here a new 3D printing process is reported that executes full degree-of-freedom (DOF) transformation (translating, rotating, and scaling) of each individual building layer while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques. Transforming individual building layers within the sequential layered manufacturing process enables dynamic transformation of the 3D printed parts on-the-fly, eliminating the time-consuming redesign steps. Preserving the locality of the transformation to each layer further enables the discrete conformal transformation, allowing objects such as vascular scaffolds to be optimally fabricated to properly fit within specific patient anatomy obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Finally, exploiting the freedom to control the orientation of each individual building layer, multimaterials, multiaxis 3D printing capability are further established for integrating functional modules made of dissimilar materials in 3D printed devices. This final capability is demonstrated through 3D printing a soft pneumatic gripper via heterogenous integration of rigid base and soft actuating limbs.

AB Additive manufacturing, enabling rapid prototyping and so-called on-demand production, has become a common method of creating parts or whole devices. On a 3D printer, real objects are produced layer by layer, thus creating extraordinary possibilities as to the number of applications for this type of devices. The opportunities offered by this technique seem to be pushing new boundaries when it comes to both the use of 3D printing in practice and new materials from which the 3D objects can be printed. However, the question arises whether, at the same time, this solution is safe enough to be used without limitations, wherever and by everyone. According to the scientific reports, three-dimensional printing can pose a threat to the user, not only in terms of physical or mechanical hazards, but also through the potential emissions of chemical substances and fine particles. Thus, the presented publication collects information on the additive manufacturing, different techniques, and ways of printing with application of diverse raw materials. It presents an overview of the last 5 years' publications focusing on 3D printing, especially regarding the potential chemical and particle emission resulting from the use of such printers in both the working environment and private spaces.

AB Past work has shown that particle material extrusion (fused particle fabrication (FPF)/fused granular fabrication (FGF)) has the potential for increasing the use of recycled polymers in 3D printing. This study extends this potential to high-performance (high-mechanical-strength and heat-resistant) polymers using polycarbonate (PC). Recycled PC regrind of approximately 25 mm(2) was 3D printed with an open-source Gigabot X and analyzed. A temperature and nozzle velocity matrix was used to find useful printing parameters, and a print test was used to maximize the output for a two-temperature stage extruder for PC. ASTM type 4 tensile test geometries as well as ASTM-approved compression tests were used to determine the mechanical properties of PC and were compared with filament printing and the bulk virgin material. The results showed the tensile strength of parts manufactured from the recycled PC particles (64.9 MPa) were comparable to that of the commercial filament printed on desktop (62.2 MPa) and large-format (66.3 MPa) 3D printers. Three case study applications were investigated: (i) using PC as a rapid molding technology for lower melting point thermoplastics, (ii) printed parts for high temperature applications, and (iii) printed parts for high-strength applications. The results show that recycled PC particle-based 3D printing can produce high-strength and heat-resistant products at low costs.

AB Herein, the effects of recycled polymers on the mechanical properties of additively manufactured specimens, specifically those derived by fused deposition modelling, are determined. The intention is to investigate how 3D-printing can be more sustainable and how recycled polymers compare against conventional ones. Initially, sustainability is discussed in general and more sustainable materials such as recycled filaments and biodegradable filaments are introduced. Subsequently, a comparison of the recycled filament recycled Polyethylene terephthalate (rePET) and a conventional Polyethylene terephthalate with glycol (PETG) filament is drawn upon their mechanical performance under tension, and the geometry and slicing strategy for the 3D-printed specimens is discussed. Finally, the outcomes from the experiments are compared against numerically determined results and conclusions are drawn.

AB Among the available additive manufacturing technologies, extrusion based 3D printing (otherwise known as fused deposition modelling or fused filament fabrication) is among the most commonly used due to low cost and relative simplicity. However, such printers still suffer from redundant support material waste (both interior and exterior) when printing large-volume solid objects or objects with overhangs. The support material can also be a significant cause of long part production time and higher energy consumption during manufacture. Hence, we propose a new support generation strategy considering both interior and exterior support via AM process planning to reduce the total amount of material consumption, production time and energy consumed for manufacturing an object. Print path and print orientation are both considered as significant factors and are both optimized for achieving the lowest consumption of material. The areas to be filled on each layer are determined according to the printable threshold overhang angle (PTOA) and the longest printable bridge length (LPBL). The characteristics of LPBL and PTOA are fully considered for saving more material. Several tests are used to verify the proposed strategy and the results show that this strategy can considerably reduce material waste, production time and energy consumed compared with conventional strategies, enabling AM to be a more environmentally friendly and sustainable manufacturing technique.

AB In conventional additive manufacturing, most processes for creating the layers of a part are performed on a horizontal plane. In contrast, a conformal additive manufacturing process has been suggested in order to build a real 3D structure on a freeform surface using a direct-print process based on material extrusion. A new algorithm was developed that is able to use the standard 3D printing file format that includes both a 3D model to be printed and a 3D model of a freeform substrate along with the desired printing parameters as input, and it returns G-code instructions for the 3D printing process as output. A slicing surface was generated to slice the 3D model by offsetting the surface of a freeform substrate model by a discrete amount (i.e., layer thickness) for each layer. The perimeters of each layer (including the internal features) were extracted based on the intersections between the slicing surface and the 3D model, and infill toolpaths were created by projecting 2D patterns reflecting the features to be printed with a desired fill factor (in the x-y plane) onto the slicing surface to create 3D patterns. Two printing methods, complete conformal printing and a hybrid methodology that combines conformal printing with conventional horizontal printing, were presented. Several 3D models were sliced and printed on a freeform surface to validate the developed algorithm.

AB The additive manufacturing known also as "3D printing" or "rapid prototyping" is a present manufacturing method (compared to classic manufacturing methods) where layers of material are deposited at a time (successively) until a finished product is obtained. Depending on the phenomenon, material (in solid, liquid or powder state) used by the 3D printing equipment, a solid part, can be achieved using processes as: binder jetting,extrusion, material jetting, direct energy, vat photo-polymerization and powder bed fusion. In the present paper, we have summarized some knowledge regarding the 3D printing technologies, fused deposition modeling (FDM) prototyping method, and different types of test regarding PLA material properties (tensile test, flexural test). The FDM technology has registered benefits as cost, product quality, functionality and manufacturing time, continuously optimized and adopted by more and more companies, research institutes and consumers.

AB This research focused on developing recycled polymer blend filament from post-consumer expanded polystyrene and single-use polypropylene container for fuse filament fabrication (FFF). In this work, recycled polystyrene (rPS)/recycled polypropylene (rPP) blend was extruded into filament for FFF printing. The increase in printing temperature obviously reduced the air gaps and improved the interlayer adhesion. However, the printed specimen only exhibited optimum tensile strength at printing temperature of 230 degrees C. The printed specimens with rPS/rPP at 80/20 blend ratio showed the lowest tensile strength due to poor printed layers adhesion caused by incompatibility of polymer blend. However, printed specimens with rPS/rPP at 50/50 blend ratio could achieve optimum strength of 32 MPa. The micrographs proved that the voids in printed specimen were smaller or absent when the printing temperature and rPP content in the blend was increased. This means that the increase in print temperature and rPP content displayed a positive effect on the printed specimens. The effect of blend ratio had significantly increased melt flow and crystallinity of rPS/rPP blend when the rPP content was increased in the blend. However, the increase of melt flow and crystallinity led to noticeable warpage on the printed specimen.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) is a rapidly growing technology, referring to a 3D design process by which digital data builds a physical object in layers by depositing the printed material. The AM has evolved in the aviation, automotive, and medical industries. The AM development for fiber-reinforced composites is the point of current interest, with most research focused on using short fibers. However, notwithstanding particular technological complexities, continuous filaments have superior tensile properties compared to short fibers. Therefore, this manuscript develops an adaptive continuous reinforcement approach for AM based on polymeric material extrusion (ME) technology. It combines the raw material production process, including the ability to vary constituents (e.g., filament materials, reinforcement percentage, and recycled plastic replacement ratio), and the reinforcement efficiency analysis regarding the experimentally verified numerical model. The literature review has identified compatible materials for ensuring sustainable and high-performance plastic composites reinforced with continuous fibers. In addition, it identified the applicability of recycled polymers in developing ME processes. Thus, the study includes an experimental program to investigate the mechanical performance of 3D printed samples (polylactic acid, PLA, matrix reinforced with continuous aramid filament) through a tensile test. Recycled polymer replaced 40% of the virgin PLA. The test results do not demonstrate the recycled polymer's negative effect on the mechanical performance of the printed samples. Moreover, the recycled material reduced the PLA cost by almost twice. However, together with the potential efficiency of the developed adaptive manufacturing technology, the mechanical characteristics of the printed material revealed room for printing technology improvement, including the aligned reinforcement distribution in the printed product and printing parameters' setup.

AB Many times, when 3D printed parts exceed their useful life or when there is a mistake in the manufacturing process, that 3D printed material is thrown away. To avoid such waste, that material can be shredded up and re-extruded into useable filament. There are some concerns over the degradation of the material as it is recycled and reprinted. In this study, the strength and quality of ABS plastic as it is recycled and reprinted has been investigated. The ABS at each stage of recycling was printed into "dog bone" test samples for mechanical testing. The tensile strength was measured using an MTS Universal Testing Machine. Following the completion of these tests, the chemical properties of the samples were tested using thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry. With each recycle, the tensile load capabilities of the ABS dropped by an average of 5.939%; however, chemical tests showed no significant degradation in thermal strength.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) filaments made of recycled materials are desirable for environmentally friendly and sustainable manufacturing of prototypes and load-bearing components in many applications. We investigate the effect of FDM process parameters on the mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts made of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) filaments. Increasing the nozzle temperature from 230 degrees C to 260 degrees C improves the strength of the specimens by 100%. Using a raster orientation parallel to the loading direction improves the ductility by more an order of magnitude. Specimen orientation and infill ratio also influence the mechanical properties. The temperature and the orientation effects are related to the quality of fusion between the printed lines. A modified Gibson-Ashby model correctly predicts the strength as a function of the infill ratio. Through the optimization of process parameters, the mechanical strength of 3D-printed rPET structures can reach that of injection-molded PET, making FDM a suitable manufacturing technique for load-bearing applications.

AB Zirconia materials are widely used in digital dentistry due to their excellent properties. Although zirconia prostheses are typically prepared using computer-aided design and manufacturing, additive manufacturing technology can also be used. Both digital methods, however, may result in a large amount of residue zirconia. In the present study, solvent-based slurry stereolithography was used to prepare dental zirconia samples using either pristine or recycled zirconia powder. Characteristics of pristine zirconia, recycled powder, and as-prepared slurry were examined. Whereas, the 3D-printed objects using each material were built up with a layer thickness of either 20 or 40 mu m. Post heat treatment was performed to improve the mechanical properties. Density measurement, Vickers microhardness, and flexure strength of the sintered zirconia samples were investigated. Experimental results showed that the agglomeration of zirconia occurs in recycled powder and increases the viscosity of the slurry. The sintered zirconia samples exhibited a density higher than 99% when using the pristine powder and printed with a thickness of 20 mu m, whereas the recycled powder printed with 40 mu m thickness had a density slightly higher than 90%. The Vickers microhardness (similar to 1300 HV) was similar for sintered samples, but the flexure strength was significantly different. The flexure strength can reach up to 1057 MPa using pristine powder and printed with a layer thickness of 20 mu m, but decrease to 389 MPa when using recycled powder with 40 mu m layer thickness. The results suggest that 3D-printed zirconia using pristine powder can be used as dental prostheses, whereas 3D-printed zirconia using recycled powder may only be suitable for incisors or other applications.

AB The primary (1 degrees) recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is one of the most acceptable thermoplastic for 3D printing applications. For ascertaining rheological and dimensional features of 3D printed functional prototypes, one must have control on feed stock filament volume and its melt flow index (MFI). Some studies have reported investigations on mechanical and thermal properties along with dimensional features and MFI of 1 degrees recycled ABS. But hitherto little has been reported on effect of cryogenic milling (CM) on rheological, morphological, and surface properties of feed stock filament (for possible 3D printing). This article reports the effect of CM on 1 degrees recycled ABS for 3D printing applications. The effects of CM input parameters such as vibration frequency (Hz), CM time (min), and weight of grinding media (g) have been investigated for rheological (MFI, sample volume), surface (Shore D hardness, porosity), and morphological (based upon photomicrographs) properties. Based upon analysis of variance for sample volume and MFI of the 1 degrees recycled ABS, grinding frequency was observed as most significant factor (91.88% for sample volume and 76.59% for MFI) at 95% confidence level in the present case study. The results of study suggest that sample volume and MFI observations are in line with Shore D hardness and porosity.

AB Mechanically robust, highly compressible, and conductive thermoplastic polyurethane/carbon black foams were successfully fabricated via 3D printing. Thixotropic inks were formulated by dispersing nanoclay, carbon black, and polymer in an organic solvent, and then 3D multifunctional sensors were prepared by direct ink writing (DIN). Sequential removal of solvent and nanoclay yielded a porous polymer/carbon black structure, which maintained excellent elasticity and compression cyclability. The presence of carbon black in the foams led to good electrical conductivity and stable piezoresistive sensing signals at a strain of up to 80%, including the ability to distinguish human motions. Complementary to a decrease in resistance upon compression, the foam can be used as a gas sensor device, as exposure to volatile organic compounds causes the polymer to swell and an increase in resistance. The printed conductive foams can be easily recycled and reprocessed by dissolution in an organic solvent and subsequent re-3D printing, with little detriment to performance.

AB Robotic clay formwork three-dimensional printing combined with incremental concrete casting controls concrete's hydrostatic pressure and enables the production of building-scale structures. Clay formwork is self-demolding and less carbon intensive than concrete and polymer, often used in formwork additive manufacturing. This research investigates the recycling and reuse of clay to re-print formworks and tailors a self-compacting concrete formula with 60% reduced cement content and 90% larger maximum aggregate size. The study then explores integrating steel fibers and longitudinal rebars into the fabrication process to provide shear and bending reinforcement. When comparing the load-bearing behaviour of the fabricated beams against those cast traditionally using wooden formworks, the fabricated beams demonstrated 20% lower load-bearing capacity, with peak load mid-span deflections staying in a similar range. While more investigation is required to address formwork deformations using mixed steel fibers and recycled clay, this research paves the way for more sustainable concrete construction practices.

AB The substitution of cement, natural sand, and synthetic fibers in concrete with solid wastes substantially reduces CO2 emissions. Incorporating solid wastes into 3D printed concrete, which reduces CO2 emissions from labor and formwork, can achieve innovative low-carbon construction materials. However, the previous studies lack a comprehensive review on the inherent characteristics of various solid wastes and their impacts on the printability, mechanical performance, and functionality of 3D printed concrete. This paper reviews the present state of research and introduces feasible methods for the sustainable use of solid wastes in 3D printed concrete. Numerous types of solid wastes are investigated comprising their benefits, shortages, and fit dose to guide in selecting the optimal solid waste to enhance the performance of printed concrete. Additionally, the printability, functionality, and mechanical strength of printed concrete with solid waste addition are quantified and summarized. The preliminary exploration to achieve a balance between multi-functionality and mechanical properties using mixed solid wastes is conducted for 3D concrete printing. Finally, machine learning, broadening raw material sources, automated monitoring systems, multi-functionalized composite, and BIM are proposed to address current challenges.

AB Plastics are used in a wide range of engineering applications in different industrial sectors like electronics, automotive, construction, packaging, white goods. Thanks to a combination of low-cost, ease of manufacturing and processing, excellent physical and chemical properties combined with adequate mechanical properties for structural applications, a tremendous and continuous increase in the consumption of polymer materials has occurred worldwide. However, the flip side of this ever-increasing consumption is the huge amount of waste, leading to deleterious environmental, health and economic impacts. Besides the use of recycled plastics, another important factor contributes to a material-efficient approach in the manufacturing industry; it is the mechanical design for 3D printing (or additive manufacturing), where minimum material usage complying with lightweight, stiffness and strength requirements is pursued by topology optimization. In this technical and economical international scenario, the present paper presents a bibliographic survey concerning the structural durability of additively manufactured recycled plastics and compounds. In particular, the paper is aimed at investigating the structural durability of three "families" of recycled plastics (rPlastic), i.e. rABS, rPP and rPP/glass fiber compound. Therefore, a literature survey regarding the considered materials will be presented by focusing on the influence of the 3D-printing process parameters on their mechanical and fatigue properties. Finally, a comparison between the results found in the literature of 3D-printed and traditionally manufactured polymers will be reported. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB Transforming waste polypropylene (PP) and waste carbon fibre into upcycled composite materials for additive manufacturing represents an ideal circular economy challenge. An optimized method for material extrusion and 3D printing was developed to overcome adhesion and warpage challenges during printing. The study explored the impact of varying waste carbon fibre weight fractions (0 wt%, 2 wt%, 5 wt%, 8 wt%, 15 wt%, and 25 wt%), firstly on the properties of filament and then on printability and mechanical properties of printed specimens. Optimized extrusion parameters yielded the successful fabrication of fibre-reinforced filaments. Micro-level assessment of the polymer revealed a decrease in mechanical properties due to thermal processes during filament making and 3D printing. Microstructural analysis, along with optical and scanning electron microscopy, provided insights into inter-bead voids, debonding, fibre dispersion, fracture modes, and filament/sample quality. Differential Scanning Calorimetry indicated slight matrix degradation during filament extrusion, leading to slightly reduced melting and crystallization temperatures.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is becoming a revolutionary technique across various fields. Especially, digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing shows advantages of high resolution and high efficiency. However, multifunctional monomers are commonly used to meet the rapid liquid-to-solid transformation during DLP printing, and the extensive production of unreprocessable thermosets will lead to resource waste and environmental problems. Here, we report a family of dynamic polymers with highly tailorable mechanical properties for DLP printing. The dynamic polymers cross-linked by ionic bonding and hydrogen bonding endow printed objects with excellent self-healing and recycling ability. The mechanical properties of printed objects can be easily tailored from soft elastomers to rigid plastics to satisfy practical applications. Taking advantage of the dynamic cross-linking, various assembling categories, including 2D to 3D, small to large 3D structures, and same to different materials assembly, and functional devices with a self-healing capacity can be realized. This study not only helps to address environmental issues caused by traditional DLP-printed thermosets but also realizes the on-demand fabrication of complex structures.

TI Effect of carbonated recycled coarse aggregates on the mechanical

DE 3D printed concrete; Recycled coarse aggregate; Carbonation; Mechanical
   properties; Pore structure
AB A modification method of carbonation combined with presoaking in nano-SiO2 solution was employed to enhance the recycled coarse aggregates (RCA). The water absorption, apparent density and crushing index of RCA before and after carbonation were tested. The water absorption, compressive strength, flexural strength and splitting tensile strength of 3D printed recycled aggregate concrete (3DPRAC) with different RCA replacement rates were further investigated. Microscopic tests including X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy were performed to analyze the changes in phase composition and microstructure of RCA, while X-ray computed tomography was utilized to explore the pore defect evolution of 3DPRAC. The results demonstrated the method of carbonation combined with presoaking in nano-SiO2 solution significantly improved the physical characteristics of RCA and densified the microstructure of 3DPRAC. With an increase in RCA replacement rate, there was a decrease in the mechanical properties in all directions. At the RCA replacement rate of 100 %, the compressive strength, flexural strength and splitting tensile strength increased by a maximum of 24.71 % in the X direction, 12.95 % in the Y direction and 18.27 % in the Z direction after RCA carbonation, respectively. The pore defects of 3DPRAC were effectively optimized by the inclusion of carbonated RCA. The modification mechanism was explained based on the enhanced performance of RCA and pore defect evolution.

AB From commercial pellets of recycled polyethylene terephthalate glycol (R-PETG), 1.75 mm diameter filaments for 3D printing were produced. By varying the filament's deposition direction between 10 degrees and 40 degrees to the transversal axis, parallelepiped specimens were fabricated by additive manufacturing. When bent at room temperature (RT), both the filaments and the 3D-printed specimens recovered their shape during heating, either without any constraint or while lifting a load over a certain distance. In this way, free-recovery and work-generating shape memory effects (SMEs) were developed. The former could be repeated without any visible fatigue marks for as much as 20 heating (to 90 ffi C)-RT cooling-bending cycles, while the latter enabled the lifting of loads over 50 times heavier than the active specimens. Tensile static failure tests revealed the superiority of the specimens printed at larger angles over those printed at 10 degrees, since the specimens printed at 40 degrees had tensile failure stresses and strains over 35 MPa and 8.5%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) fractographs displayed the structure of the successively deposited layers and a shredding tendency enhanced by the increase in the deposition angle. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis enabled the identification of the glass transition between 67.5 and 77.3 degrees C, which might explain the occurrence of SMEs in both the filament and 3D-printed specimens. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) emphasized a local increase in storage modulus of 0.87-1.66 GPa that occurred during heating, which might explain the development of work-generating SME in both filament and 3D-printed specimens. These properties recommend 3D-printed parts made of R-PETG as active elements in low-price lightweight actuators operating between RT and 63 degrees C.

AB Purpose - This purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of the steps and processes behind successfully adapting novel materials, namely virgin glass and recycled glass, to three-dimensional printing (3DP).
   Design/methodology/approach - The transition from 3DP ceramic systems to glass systems will be examined in detail, including the necessary modifications to binder systems and printing parameters. The authors present preliminary engineering data on shrinkage, porosity, and density as functions of peak firing temperature, and provide a brief introduction to the complexities faced in realizing an adequate and repeatable firing method for 3D printed glass.
   Findings - Shrinkage behavior for the 3D printed recycled glass showed significant anisotropy, especially beyond peak firing temperatures of 730 degrees C. The average shrinkage ratios for the slow- and fast-axes to the Z-axis were 1:1.37 and 1:2.74, respectively. These extreme differences can be attributed to the layer-by-layer production method and binder burn-off. At 760 degrees C, the apparent porosity reached a minimum of 0.36 percent, indicative of asymptotic behavior that approaches a fully dense 3DP glass specimen. At low firing temperatures, the bulk density was similar to water, but increased to a maximum of 2.41 g/cm(3). This indicates that 3DP recycled glass can behave similarly to common glass with accepted published bulk densities ranging from 2.4-2.8 g/cm(3).
   Research limitations/implications - Heating schedule analysis and optimization may reduce geometric variations, therefore, the firing method should be investigated in greater depth.
   Originality/value - This paper provides a guide to successfully adopting glass to commercially available 3DP hardware. This research has also enabled rapid prototyping of recycled glass, a monumental step towards a sustainable future for 3DP.

AB 3D printing is considered a disruptive technology and it continues to expand the design space boundaries for prototypes and final products. Sustainability is one of the major objectives for manufacturing, and the use of recycled materials is becoming a relevant sustainability strategy, particularly for improving material resource efficiency. This paper evaluates the suitability of substituting virgin polylactic acid (PLA) for recycled PLA. It describes an experimental plan divided into three phases to evaluate the specimens' tensile strength. The results showed that recycled PLA could be used thanks to a similar tensile strength, even though this is slightly lower than that of the virgin material. In addition, the infill density and the orientation parameters played a major role in the response. As the infill density approaches 100%, both the maximum load and tensile strength increase sharply. However, when using an infill density of 40%, on average, the specimen resists 58.07% of the maximum load. In addition, because of the anisotropy, the horizontal orientation allowed attaining a higher tensile strength while the vertical orientation provided a lower value. These are relevant insights for prescriptions of the 3D-printing parameters guaranteeing minimum tensile strength in prototyping.

AB 3D-printable artificial muscles have only recently garnered interest, and few 3D-printed artificial muscles have been demonstrated. In this article, we introduce the concept of thermoplastic electroactive gels, new smart materials that can be fabricated simply and rapidly by heating, overcoming the limitations of previous dangerous and time-consuming solvent-based manufacturing methods, and enabling hot-pressing, melt-recycling, extrusion and 3D-printing. We present and characterise a new example material, PVC-DIDA (polyvinyl chloride and diisodecyl adipate) gel and demonstrate multi-layer PVC-DIDA gel artificial muscles. Finally, the extrudability of PVC-DIDA gel is confirmed, and an artificial muscle made from extruded electroactive gel is presented. The electroactivity and extrudability of these thermoplastic gels highlights them as excellent candidate materials for 3D-printing artificial muscle structures.

AB There is an increasing need for 3D printing of metallic structures in a green and cost-effective way. Here, an environment-friendly and reusable metallic ink was developed for an economical metal 3D printing method. The metallic ink is composed of steel micro powders, a biodegradable polymer: chitosan, acetic acid and deionized water. The metal 3D printing method consists of: (i) 3D printing of metallic structures using the metallic ink at room temperature, (ii) thermal treatments on the as-printed structures that decompose the polymer binder and sinter the steel powders, and (iii) an optional step: infiltrating melted copper into the sintered structures to achieve fully dense metal/metal hybrid structures. We demonstrate that any incorrectly built as-printed structures and scrap materials can be recycled and reused for 3D printing by dissolving them again in acetic acid. The fabricated structures after copper infiltration feature a low filament porosity of 1.0% which enables high properties such as an electrical conductivity of 1.3 x 10(6) S/m and a Young's modulus of 160 GPa. The metallic ink can be used for the 3D printing of high performance metallic structures while demonstrating a low environmental impact and a very effective utilization of metallic materials.

AB A precision core-drilling machine has been designed and constructed almost entirely from 3D printing. The purpose of the drill is to extract 3 mm diameter discs from thin slices of mainly hard brittle materials for analysis in a transmission electron microscope. Novel methods of producing a slide bearing and shaft couplings in 3D printed components have been developed. Design principles and material selection are discussed, and the drill is evaluated by preparing samples from silicon and aluminium. The device can be self-made by any laboratory with a 3D printer, can be recycled when no longer required and can help labs reach their sustainable development goals.

TI 3D Printing of continuous fiber composites using two-stage UV curable

ID CARBON-FIBER; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; POLYMERS; INTERFACE; BEHAVIOR
AB 3D printing allows for moldless fabrication of continuous fiber composites with high design freedom and low manufacturing cost per part, which makes it particularly well-suited for rapid prototyping and composite product development. Compared to thermal-curable resins, UV-curable resins enable the 3D printing of composites with high fiber content and faster manufacturing speeds. However, the printed composites exhibit low mechanical strength and weak interfacial bonding for high-performance engineering applications. In addition, they are typically not reprocessable or repairable; if they could be, it would dramatically benefit the rapid prototyping of composite products with improved durability, reliability, cost savings, and streamlined workflow. In this study, we demonstrate that the recently emerged two-stage UV-curable resin is an ideal material candidate to tackle these grand challenges in 3D printing of thermoset composites with continuous carbon fiber. The resin consists primarily of acrylate monomers and crosslinkers with exchangeable covalent bonds. During the printing process, composite filaments containing up to 30.9% carbon fiber can be rapidly deposited and solidified through UV irradiation. After printing, the printed composites are subjected to post-heating. Their mechanical stiffness, strength, and inter-filament bonding are significantly enhanced due to the bond exchange reactions within the thermoset matrix. Furthermore, the utilization of the two-stage curable resin enables the repair, reshaping, and recycling of 3D printed thermosetting composites. This study represents the first detailed study to explore the benefits of using two-stage UV curable resins for composite printing. The fundamental understanding could potentially be extended to other types of two-stage curable resins with different molecular mechanisms.
   A two stage UV-curable resin is an ideal feedstock material to enable the printing of continuous fiber composites with outstanding mechanical properties. It also enables the repair, reshaping, and recycling of printed composites.

AB Purpose Industries and businesses are pursuing Industry 4.0 technologies as well as adopting a circular approach focused on improving manufacturing processes through the reduction of wastes, CO2 emissions and mineral exploration to mitigate the impact of climate change. In this sense, additive manufacturing (AM), often referred to as 3D printing, can play a key role in the closed-loop of operations. However, academics and practitioners have scarcely discussed the feasibility of implementing AM alongside circular economy (CE) practices, the techniques and methods that this would require, or how AM could benefit sustainability and circularity. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a novel circular sustainable 3D printing model for scrap recycling in the automotive industry. Design/methodology/approach The methodology uses a literature review-based approach followed by empirical research using metal scraps as the raw material for fabricating a powder to input a metal 3D printer for generating sustainable automotive components. A conceptual sustainable circular model for the automotive industry is proposed. Next, is conducted a focus group comprises AM and automotive industry experts for evaluations. Findings The results indicate that the proposed model can be used to reintroduce waste back into the manufacturing chain as raw material for the on-demand manufacture and supply of automotive components and that it may also have social and environmental implications. Originality/value This paper's contributions are threefold: it explores the combined use of Industry 4.0 (I4.0), CE and sustainability in the automotive industry, develops a new model to support the circularity and sustainability of the scrap chain and proposes the use of AM as a catalyst of CE practices by reproducing recycled components with a 3D printer for prototypes or fully functioning components.

AB This study investigates the sustainable valorization of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) fibers through dopamine surface modification for enhanced 3D printed concrete (3DPC). Comprehensive tests on flowability, rheology, buildability, and mechanical anisotropy were conducted to assess the impacts of various MPET fiber content (0-0.5 vol%). The results showed that 0.5 vol% MPET fibers significantly increased dynamic yield stress and plastic viscosity by 247.6 % and 200.0 %, respectively, compared to the control group (P-0), while moderately reducing flowability. The 0.3 vol% content was found to be optimal, enhancing maximum printing heights in hollow cylindrical and rectangular structures by 114.8 % and 130 %, respectively, compared to the control. At this content, the 30-minute early compressive strength reached 66.0 MPa. Quantitative analysis revealed a strong correlation (R2 > 0.94) between early strength development parameters and buildability performance, with rate of strength gain exerting greater influence than initial strength. Mechanical anisotropy tests showed that MPET fibers significantly enhanced the flexural strength of 3DPC in the Z-direction of printing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis confirmed that dopamine modification significantly enhanced the fiber-matrix interface bonding. This research applies modified recycled PET fibers to enhance 3DPC performance while contributing to sustainability efforts in the construction sector, supporting approaches that integrate material recycling with technical innovation.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing has recently been introduced into the construction of catalysts with integral structures, but its use has been limited due to material and structural constraints. In this work, the liquid crystal display 3D printing technology is employed to prepare 3D printed monolithic catalysts with high structural complexity for oxidative desulfurization of fuels. The catalytic active sites of the materials are in-situ introduced during the synthesis process through a facile ball milling-3D print-sintering process. Through a variety of characterization methods, molybdenum oxide has been proved to be uniformly loaded on the composite support with great mechanical properties and dimensional stability. This monolithic catalyst possesses excellent catalytic performance in the oxidation of dibenzothiophene, reaching 98.6% sulfur removal. Moreover, the catalyst shows excellent thermal and chemical stability, with no obvious decrease in desulfurization activity after 6 recycles. This low-cost and facile strategy may provide a new path for 3D printed structured catalysts and other functional materials with tailored properties in various catalytic applications, overcoming the structural limitations asso-ciated with traditional processing methods.

AB Interlayers have a significant impact on the mechanical properties and integrity of 3D printed concrete structures. The interlayer shear strength of 3D printed recycled mortar (3DPRM) was tested at interval times of 0 min24 h, considering the effects of moisture, pore structure, and hydration products of the interlayer. Furthermore, the enhancement mechanism of superabsorbent polymer (SAP) incorporation on the interlayer adhesion of 3DPRM was also investigated. The findings indicated that as the time intervals increased, there was a corresponding increase in the yield stress of the bottom filament, leading to an increase in thickness and degradation of pore structures in the interlayer region. Additionally, there was a loss in moisture and a reduction in unhydrated particles, resulting in a decrease in the amount of C-S-H. As the bottom filament progressed from its fresh state to the final setting, the dominant factor in interlayer adhesion changed from moisture to pore structure. This conclusion provides a theoretical basis for solving the interlayer cold joint problem at different time intervals. The incorporation of 0.3% SAP completely offset the negative effect of recycled sand incorporation on interlayer adhesion strength and has good potential for practical application.

AB 3D printing, a rapidly growing material processing technique has found its broad applications in construction, automobiles, robotics, domestic usage and in biomedical sectors due to its ability to fabricate the desirable objects from scratch. However, due to the non-recyclable and non-reprocessable nature of most printed structures, the discarded 3D printed objects generate wastes after damage or use. Covalent Adaptable Networks (CANs) are polymeric networks those can change their network topology by exchanging their functionalities under external stimuli, thus, rendering the printed objects recyclable, therefore helpful in terms of reducing waste. The fabricated objects may also be endowed with properties such as self-healing, shape-memory, enhanced mechanical strength, degradability, and reprintability. The present article covers different methods utilized for 3D printing of the polymers having CANs, including a detailed insight to present trends and technologies in the field. In addition, their applications, particularly in soft robotics and biomedical fields have been discussed. Future perspectives regarding the challenges, new potential applications as well as importance of continuous advancements in the field of 3D printing of CANs have also been discussed.

AB This work explores the use of additive manufacturing (AM) to reprocess recycled glass and carbon fibers in the automotive sector. It aims to foster exploitation of recycled Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rGFRPs) and recycled Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymers (rCFRPs) through two manufacturing workflows: indirect Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) and UV-assisted Direct Ink Writing (UV-DIW). An industrial case study on vehicle components has been considered by prototyping one real component. After the tensile tests, some molds were fabricated with a FFF 3D printer for the indirect 3D printing process to cast an epoxy-based thermosetting resin with rGFs and rCFs. The second technology consisted in fabricating the parts by hardening in-situ a photo- and thermal-curable thermosetting acrylic liquid resin with rGFs. These results validate the use of AM and recycled composites for applications in the automotive sector. These approaches may be implemented for customizable components for batches below 100 vehicles as the first step for their exploitation.

AB Combining recycling of paper wastes (WPs) with extrusion-based additive manufacturing represents a sustainable route to cellular cellulose composites tailored for lightweight construction. Particularly, shear mixing of shredded WPs with an aqueous solution of a polymer binder like polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) yields aqueous pastes suitable for 3D printing. As a shear thinning additive, both WP and microfibrillated cellulose account for enhanced shear thinning and dimensional stability. Opposite to the formation of dense WP/PVA composites by melt extrusion, 3D printing of aqueous pastes produces cellular cellulose/PVA composites exhibiting hierarchical pore architectures. In spite of low densities around 0.8 g cm(-3), high Young's modulus (2.0 GPa) and tensile strength (53 MPa) are achieved. Mechanical stability, water resistance, and even flame retardancy simultaneously improve by crosslinking with glyoxal and especially by mineralization. Multimaterial 3D printing combines the 3D dispensing of cellulose/PVA pastes with the simultaneous, staged, or subsequent spraying of aqueous water glass to enable mineralization of composite surface, bulk, and interlayers. Furthermore, the glyoxal-mediated crosslinking affords thermo- and moisture-responsive cellulose/PVA composites with programmable shape change induced either by heating at 100 degrees C or by exposure to moisture at 37 degrees C.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing of waste plastic such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) is challenging because multiple heating cycles and irregular cooling cause accumulation of stress in 3D-printed structures, which significantly affects mesostructured and fiber-to-fiber bond strength. Hence, this study demonstrates the ability to print high-quality parts via 3D printing using ABS waste. The different weight proportions (100, 90/10, 80/20, 70/30, 60/40, 50/50) of recycled ABS (RABS)/virgin ABS (VABS) are selected for experimentation. It is found that increasing VABS content in RABS significantly improved the physical properties of samples. Due to VABS blending in RABS, the average enhancement in flexural strength (Sf), flex modulus (Ef), and work of fracture (WOF) are 11.49%, 5.45%, and 17.31%, respectively, when compared with 100% RABS samples. Similarly, the average increase in Young's modulus (E), tensile strength at yield (Ty), and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are 7.71%, 5.19%, and 3.51%, respectively. The samples printed with 50% RABS/50% VABS blends show superior mechanical properties than others, also the properties of 90% RABS/10% VABS and 80% RABS/20% VABS are very close to 100% VABS samples. Hence, this study provides unique opportunities for the sustainable use of waste ABS using 3D printing technology.

AB Over the last century, improvement in mechanical performance of structural metals has primarily been achieved by creating more and more complex chemical compositions. Such compositional complexity raises costs, creates supply vulnerability, and complicates recycling. As a relatively new metal processing technique, metal 3D-printing provides a possibility to revisit and simplify alloy compositions, achieving alloy plainification, which enables simpler materials to be used versatilely. Here, we demonstrate that high performance simple plain carbon steels can be produced through 3D-printing. Our 3D-printed plain carbon steels achieve tensile and impact properties comparable, or even superior to those of ultra-high strength alloy steels such as Maraging steels. The sequential micro-scale melting and solidification intrinsic to 3D-printing provides sufficient cooling to directly form martensite and/or bainite, strengthening the steels while maintaining microstructural and property homogeneity without dimensional limitations or heat treatment distortion and cracking. By manipulating 3D-printing parameters, we can tailor the microstructure, thereby control the properties for customized applications. This offers a scalable approach to reduce alloy complexity without compromising mechanical performance and highlights the opportunities for the 3D-printing to help drive alloy plainification.
   The study shows that 3D-printing enables plain carbon steels to achieve martensitic or bainitic microstructures with strength and toughness comparable to alloyed steels. It advocates for alloy simplification and sustainability in metal 3D-printing.

AB Due to increasing global concerns about plastic waste and a greater emphasis on sustainability, there is a growing interest in using recycled plastics in additive manufacturing. Still, the weak strength of additively manufactured components with recycled material remains an ongoing challenge. In the realm of 3D printing, the incorporation of additives has shown huge potential as an effective means to enhance the performance of recycled materials. Due to low crystallinity of recycled polylactic acid (rPLA) material, 3D-printed products with rPLA exhibit the poor thermo-mechanical properties which restrict its applications in many fields. To overcome this problem, in the present work, the authors focused on using the waste 3D-printed PLA parts and silver-graphite (Ag-Gr) as reinforced material (varying 1, 2.5 and 5 wt.%) to develop the recycled-reinforced composite feedstock filament (diameter: 1.75 +/- 0.05 mm) through extrusion process for fused-filament fabrication process. To assess the suitability and feasibility of the developed composite filament for additive manufacturing, a range of characterization techniques are employed, i.e., melt flow index (MFI) measurements to evaluate processability, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) for chemical analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) for morphological and elemental analysis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) for crystallinity assessment, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for thermal characterization. With the incorporation of Ag-Gr (5% wt.) in rPLA, no nozzle clogging was detected during 3D-printing process, providing a superior quality of 3D printing of samples. The 3D-printed samples with PLA, rPLA and different wt.% combinations (from 1 to 5%) of Ag-Gr in rPLA were tested for tensile strength. The maximum tensile strength was observed to be 27.86 MPa for the sample printed with Ag-Gr (5%)/rPLA (95%) filament, which was 73.47% higher than those of the rPLA filament. The increase in crystallinity of the filaments was observed by XRD analysis due to the nucleating effect of Ag-Gr. The maximum crystallinity of 12.23% was observed in the filament containing 5 wt% Ag-Gr, which was 84.46% higher than those of the rPLA filament. The characterization results reveal that chemical properties remain consistent, but the mechanical properties are improved with the incorporation of Ag-Gr in rPLA.

AB There have been many studies on three-dimensional (3D) printing using metal compounds. However, 3D printing using a metal compound has disadvantages in that it increases the cost for supplying metal materials. A method of using slag which is a recyclable material has been proposed to reduce costs. With the growing demand for additive manufacturing using by-products, slag has gained attention as a diverse recycling material for 3D printing technologies. A new fabrication approach was analyzed for producing porous bodies via additive manufacturing for blending slag and reinforced metals. However, because of its low quality due to low strength, low durability, and structural defeats, the amount of slag generated is high, and its usability remains uncertain. Also, slag is an excellent material with a huge potential for producing structures with high mechanical properties, and limited research in the area of slag recycling has been conducted due to difficulties in sintering the iron by-products. To develop a recycling approach that utilizes slag in 3D printing powders, a study to increase the industrial usability by mixing slag and ceramic beads was described. A method was presented to compare the physical properties of 3D printed slag parts with the physical properties of those generated by blending iron slag, alumina, and zirconia. In order to find the mixing ratio with the optimum physical properties, the average particle size, bending stress, and maximum compressive stress were tested. The combination ratio to obtain the highest strength was when iron slag powder was 40% and alumina was 60%. In addition, the specimens by composition to which the stress test was applied were cut to analyze the tissue under a microscope. It is thought that cracking in the sintered structure decreases and density increases by mixing alumina and zirconium, contributing to increased strength. When a ceramic bead composed of alumina and zirconium is mixed with slag to form a composite material, a metal compound having a level of physical properties that can be used as a material for 3D printing can be produced. Furthermore, a novel concept of producing lightweight structural materials via additive manufacturing, which entails a fabrication process whereby high-strength metals are stacked inside hollow base steels, was proposed.

Therefore, fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique has grabbed the attention of researchers and industries. Despite the promising results, available materials for metal FDM 3D printing are very limited. The current study presents the development of a novel metal-infused polymeric feedstock for FDM 3D printing, consists of spiky-shaped recycled nickel powders and polylactic-acid (PLA) polymer matrix. A low-cost desktop 3D printer is employed to produce green parts; subsequently, debinding/sintering processes can be conducted to achieve a fully metallic part. The low-cost recycled nickel powder that has been used in this study is produced using the low-carbon footprint Mond process, with a significant application in production and recycling of nickel- and iron-based batteries. Furthermore, PLA is chosen because it is bio-based and biodegradable with a lower carbon footprint in the carbon cycle than fossil-fuel-derived polymers. Therefore, the whole process is an ecofriendly cycle, stepping toward the sustainable and affordable production of metallic components. Regarding development of a novel feedstock material compatible with 3D printing, it is important to understand its properties. So, the developed feedstock materials were rheologically and physico-mechanically analyzed to find the optimum filler concentration.

AB A designer 's work is based on creativity, innovation, and fresh ideas therefore, they are constantly searching for creative designs, especially when it comes to furniture and internal design. Meanwhile, innovative materials and ideas are actively sought after by designers for usage in furniture and interior design. In this scope, our study explores the practical implications of using date palm fronds and plastic waste from drinking water bottle to create a composite with varying loadings of date palm frond nanoparticles (DPFNP) at 10, 20, and 30 wt % and its applications on furniture design. A desktop extruder was used to form the composites into filaments, which were subsequently used to create 3D-printed specimens. The impact of adding (DPFNP) on the composite 's mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties was assessed. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) drinking water bottle waste, and filament composites presented similar FTIR spectra; however, filament composites presented increased thermal stability and mechanical strength. The filament with 10 wt% DPFNP has been effectively printed with a 3D printer, demonstrating the practicality of employing the developed filaments and perhaps encouraging new uses in furniture and interior design. As a result, employing DPFNP in the recycled PET (RPET) matrix offers a cheap substitute for making filaments. It could increase the use of 3D printing in furniture and interior design by using more environmentally friendly materials. This result will be considered the first phase of future research investigation on a full-scale furniture prototype, examining its physical, thermal, and mechanical properties.

AB Additive manufacturing, particularly with UV-curable resin-based 3D printing, has revolutionized production processes, allowing precise fabrication of intricate geometries. However, challenges persist in composite printing, particularly in meeting the demand for second-life applications due to the considerable volume of carbon fiber waste. This study addresses this issue by researching the compatibility of mechanically produced recyclable carbon fibers with UV-curable resin. The short carbon fibers were combined with the resin at varying weight percentages (1.5, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 wt.%) to determine the optimal ratio for achieving maximum Young's modulus and tensile strength in resulting composites. Utilizing digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing technology, the study systematically evaluated composite roughness, surface hardness, and voids volume. Each 3 wt.% increase in recycled carbon fiber concentration within the UV-curable resin resulted in a 0.01 g/cm3 density decrease, accompanied by a 0.02 mu m increase in surface roughness, with no impact on hardness. Notably, the 3 wt.% concentration proved optimal, exhibiting a 27% increase in Young's modulus and a 44% increase in tensile strength compared to the pure resin.

AB Sustainability in additive manufacturing (AM) (3D printing) could play a pivotal role for manufacturers and producers in the next-generation manufacturing framework. The market for 3D printing is expanding rapidly, and it is expected to do so in the foreseeable years to come. As ecologically, responsible manufacturing gains more attention, renewable substitutes for regular commercial 3D printable inks must be developed for lower environmental carbon footprints (less CO2 emissions, recycling, bio-compatibility, and zero waste). Herein, we review the recent literature on using vegetable oil (VO) as bio-based inks for sustainable formulations for digital light processing or stereolithography additive printing. The feedstock selections (VO, terpenes, and waste cooking oil), and the chemistry of the VO-based synthons toward sustainability in the field of photopolymerization-based 3D printing are discussed. These renewable materials can mitigate the detrimental environmental effects of AM while remaining competitive with the existing fossil-based resins produced by industrial manufacturers. The current challenges and limitations of AM in terms of surface finish, material properties, photo-curing time, and end-of-use recycling options from biomass-derived photocurable monomers are also identified. Overall, this development promotes the bio-based economy and allows for the on-demand production of a variety of sustainable inks for AM and sustainable end-of-use products.

AB Thermosetting plastics account for approximately 18% of global plastic production, with an annual global production of 65 million tons. The vast majority of thermosetting plastic waste are buried, burned, or discharged into the ocean, causing serious pollution to the natural environment. How to develop a green, energy-saving, and high value-added recycling method is a major challenge in plastic recycling. Ultraviolet (UV)-curable resins derived from renewable resources for constructing high strength vitrimeric materials and 3D printed subjects are important for sustainability and responsive recycling. Herein, a resin (tartaric acid-glycidyl methacrylate, TAGM) containing two methacrylate groups, two ss-hydroxyl ester groups and a vicinal diol group was prepared from biomass tartaric acid via a green and sustainable strategy including one-step & solvent -free procedure. After facile UV-curing of TAGM, thermally reprocessable polymeric networks were obtained and tested to have high glass transition temperature (Tg), mechanical strength, Young's modulus and toughness of 127.6 degrees C, 104.4 MPa, 1244.2 MPa and 6.3 MJ/m3, respectively. The polar vicinal diol group from tartaric acid (TA) plays a critical role for the advantageous thermomechanical performances, as learned in a comparative study with similarly structured monomers from succinic acid (SA) and L-malic acid (MA). Additionally, the TAGM with 30% diluent of hydroxyethyl methacrylate was utilized for three dimensional (3D) printing, and exhibited smaller penetration depth and high resolution. This work demonstrates a feasible approach to fabricate biobased resin for high strength vitrimeric materials and customized manufacturing via 3D printing.The resulted mechanically robust and vitrimeric subjects with significant comprehensive advantages and will provide important inspiration for plastic recycling and reducing plastic pollution.

AB This research aims to develop sustainable waste management practices in the construction industry by substituting components in 3D printing concrete (3DPC) with recycled glass waste material. This substitution not only improved concrete durability but also reduces environmental demand and promotes sustainability in the construction industry. Waste recycled glass was incorporated as cementitious material and fillers to formulate an environmentally friendly 3DPC. The study considered four aspects: waste material characterisation, mix design formulation, formulation modification optimisation for 3D printing, and potential of the obtained paste in a circular economy. Characterisation of materials was performed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to determine the elemental composition, X-ray diffraction (XRD) to determine the phase analysis, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT-IR) to determine the structural bonding, and Particle Size Analysis to determine the particle size distribution. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the effects of incorporating waste glass as filler in formulations suited for 3DPC. It contributes to knowledge regarding the optimal percentages and replacement levels of these waste materials to achieve the desired 3D printing properties. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the sustainability of buildings and infrastructure by addressing material selection, energy efficiency, local sourcing, design optimization, recycling and reuse, durability, labour reduction, and waste reduction.

AB 3D concrete printing (3DCP) is an innovative construction technique that enables the creation of complex and customized structures. This technology offers advantages such as reduced waste materials, faster construction times, and the ability to produce unique designs with intricate details. This article reviews the latest advancements in the 3DCP technology, its potential to transform the building and construction industry, and the latest developments in the 3DCP systems, methodologies, materials, and applications. The article concludes that several parameters and concrete mix proportions heavily influence the 3DCP process. Using waste materials as supplementary cementitious materials can significantly improve the 3D-printed concrete's rheology, but the excessive use can decrease the early strength. Lastly, using recycled sand in 3D printing can reduce the flexural stiffness and strength of the printed objects when loaded from different directions. The article also categorizes large-scale 3DCP technologies, highlighting the need to optimize printing ink for better economic and environmental outcomes using waste materials in 3DCP applications.

AB The recycling of thermoplastic domestic waste (like kitchenware, sanitary ware, toys, etc.) comprising acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA), etc., is of environmental concern for plastic solid waste management, especially in urban areas. The aluminum (Al) powder endures dynamic exothermic reaction when oxidized and has numerous applications in the pyrotechnic process, and subsequently, its waste is available in abundance from the firecracker industry. Some studies have reported secondary (2 & DEG;) recycling of different thermoplastics, but hitherto less has been reported on reinforcement of Al powder (& AP;45-50 & mu;m) collected from the firecracker industry in ABS and PLA matrix. This study highlights the 2 & DEG; recycling of ABS-PLA-Al matrix for possible 3D printing of fire sensors (both for domestic and industrial applications). The results suggest that initially 80%ABS-20%PLA (by weight %) matrix was found suitable for 3D printing based on a rheological property (of collected domestic waste), which was further used to reinforce 5%Al powder for enhancing the exothermic reaction (for its possible use as fire sensor). The outcomes of the study are supported by thermal, mechanical, Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)-energy-dispersion spectroscopy (EDS)-based morphological analysis.

AB Plastic use and disposal is a major issue that still to be solved on the perspective of a more sustainable development of human activities. Circular economy has been proposed as a potential solution by using materials and energy through multiple phases in a recycling flow. However, most of the studies present in the literature of plastic recycling and other wastes are mainly focused on large centralized networks that try to efficiently carry their costs and / or income. In addition, particularly the centralized plastic recycling networks should face the challenge of collection and transportation for high volume and low weight polymers, affecting its economic feasibility. The emergence and development of Open-source technologies such as 3D printing extrusion and other devices provide an opportunity to explore distributed recycling as an alternative option. Under this distributed model, users will collect domestic plastic waste themselves, which can be recycled at their nearest recycling points, such as FabLabs, in order to produce 3D plastic filament and thus contribute to the Circular Economy by reducing the plastic waste.
   On despite its attractiveness, the complexity of this distributed approach represents a limit to this application. Moreover, the environmental and economical effectiveness still needs to be demonstrated. In this article, a conceptual model is developed and proposed for the collection process in a Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network of local and distributed plastic recycling in order to analyze its economic and environmental feasibility.

AB This review aims to present the different approaches to lessen the environmental impact of the extrusion-based additive manufacturing (MEX) process of thermoplastic-based resins and protect the ecosystem. The benefits and drawbacks of each alternative, including the use of biomaterials or recycled materials as feedstock, energy efficiency, and polluting emissions reduction, have been examined. First, the technological option of using a pellet-fed printer was compared to a filament-fed printer. Then, common biopolymers utilized in MEX applications are discussed, along with methods for improving the mechanical properties of associated printed products. The introduction of natural fillers in thermoplastic resins and the use of biocomposite filaments have been proposed to improve the specific performance of printed items, highlighting the numerous challenges related to their extrusion. Various polymers and fillers derived from recycling are presented as feeding raw materials for printers to reduce waste accumulation, showing the inferior qualities of the resulting goods when compared to printed products made from virgin materials. Finally, the energy consumption and emissions released into the atmosphere during the printing process are discussed, with the potential for both aspects to be controlled through material selection and operating conditions.
   This study examines the major aspects of improving the sustainability of thermoplastic-based 3D printing by replacing synthetic raw materials with natural-based systems, or materials derived from renewable sources or recycled, and providing alternatives to reduce energy consumption and polluting emissions. The negative implications of each option on the printability, performance, and aesthetic quality of 3D parts have been discussed further. image

AB This work is aimed at proposing demonstrative actions devoted to show reprocessing and recyclability of PET originating from bottles collected from the seaside, in order to increase the consumer awareness on the importance of recycling plastics. To this purpose, collected bottles were washed, cut, grinded, extruded in the form of a thin wire adopting different cooling rates, which leads to a modulation of the crystallinity content. Once having optimized the processing parameters, the extruded wire was used to produce 3D printed samples through the fused deposition modelling (FDM). The changes in the crystalline structure due to the different processing conditions were assessed by DSC and XRD analyses, while rheological tests were performed in order to evaluate any modification in the viscosity of PET after repeated processing cycles. The reduction in thermal stability was confirmed by TGA analysis, which showed a progressive decrease in the degradation temperature as processing cycles increased. Finally, tensile tests highlighted the difference in the mechanical response due to the predominance of the crystalline or amorphous phase in the tested sample. In particular, a good mechanical behavior was found for the 3D-printed samples.

AB The modification of a rubber surface, such as cement coating, is an effective method for enhancing the mechanical performance of concrete containing recycled rubber particles. Although this method has been widely investigated for cast concrete, there is limited research on 3D-printed cementitious materials. This study explored the correlation between the compressive strength and microstructural property of 3D-printed rubberised mortar with cement-coated crumb rubber (15 wt% replacement of river sand). Multiple ratios of cement-to-rubber (C/R) were designed to achieve different coating qualities, including C/Rs of 0.25 (CR-0.25), 0.4 (CR-0.4) and 0.55 (CR-0.55). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed the existence of hardened cementitious shells outside the rubber particles, which effectively improved the interfacial bonding between the rubber surface and the cement matrix. The compressive strengths of the printed specimens did not always improve as the ratio of cement to rubber for coating increased. Moreover, the anisotropy in compressive strength was more obvious in the CR-0.4 and CR-0.55, where the strength in the Y (printing) direction was about 7 % higher than that observed in the Z (layer deposition) direction. X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis revealed that the mechanical anisotropy in CR-0.4 and CR-0.55 could be primarily attributed to two factors - pore morphology and pore orientation relative to the external loading direction. For CR-0.25, the rubber-to-matrix interface bonding appeared more critical for the compressive strength. Finally, the printed specimens showed the higher compressive strengths than the cast ones due to the lower fraction of large pores (diameters >= 1 mm).

ID BEHAVIOR
AB External loads are critical to the structural stability and construction precision of 3D printed concrete (3DPC) in the green state. However, in-depth research on this issue remains limited. This study prepared 3D printed concrete with recycled sand (3DPCRS) at replacement ratios of 0 %, 50 %, and 100 % and investigated the timedependent evolution of 3DPCRS structures in the green state under stepwise loading. Using digital image analysis, the displacement and deformation characteristics of 3DPCRS structures were examined. Additionally, static rheological tests and unconfined uniaxial compression tests were conducted to evaluate the rheological properties and green strength of 3DPCRS. The results indicated that as the recycled sand (RS) replacement ratio increases, the plastic zone area of 3DPCRS structures in the green state under loading gradually decreases. Two displacement modes were identified under loading: instantaneous sudden displacement and static creep displacement, both of which decrease with increasing RS replacement ratio. Furthermore, the yield stress and development rate of the green strength of 3DPCRS accelerate as the RS replacement ratio increases. This study elucidates the mechanisms governing the time-dependent evolution of 3DPCRS structures under loading and proposes a bearing capacity calculation model for vertical loading on the basis of structural parameters. These findings provide valuable guidance for the construction and design of 3DPC structures under loading conditions.

AB Recent advancements in additive manufacturing have created new prospects for producing biocomposite materials; however, challenges persist in the attainment of sustainable and efficient manufacturing methods. Additionally, 3D printing still has limitations such as suboptimal mechanical properties and processability issues. In this study two main objectives are addressed. First, the properties of bionanocomposites made from recycled polypropylene and date palm nanofillers were experimentally investigated using hot melt extrusion to identify the optimal nanofiller content in the polymer matrix. Second, the effects of the 3D printing parameters on the mechanical performance of these innovative materials were evaluated. The mechanical properties (tensile strength, flexural strength, and modulus of elasticity) and physical properties (water absorption) of the extruded materials were thoroughly evaluated, and the tensile strength was the primary focus for optimizing the 3D printed samples. The highest tensile (25.5 MPa) and flexural (50.6 MPa) strengths were achieved with a 3% wt. nanofiller content. To facilitate 3D printing, filaments were produced from the bionanocomposite via a single-screw extruder. The key printing parameters of the nozzle temperature (250 degrees C and 270 degrees C), printing speed (60 mm/s and 80 mm/s), and layer thickness (0.1 mm and 0.3 mm) were optimized via the design of experiment (DoE) methodology. The optimal settings were a nozzle temperature of 270 degrees C, printing speed of 60 mm/s, and layer thickness of 0.1 mm. Under these conditions, the highest tensile strength of the 3D-printed samples was 22 MPa; this value was in close agreement with the strength of the extruded material. This research contributes to sustainable manufacturing by providing valuable insights into the fabrication and performance of bionanocomposites for 3D printing applications.

AB As an environmental pollutant, formaldehyde can cause serious harm to the human body. Among many degradation methods, formaldehyde dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas putida (PFDH) exhibits broad potential because of its strong catalytic specificity and high degradation efficiency. However, the real application of PFDH in industry is limited by its instability and difficulties in recycling. In this work, the suitable printing conditions for immobilizing PFDH by three-dimensional (3D) printing technology were studied: the concentration of sodium alginate (SA) was 1.635 wt%, the concentration of CaCl2 was 7.4 wt%, the crosslinking time with CaCl2 was 8 min, and the temperature of the reaction was 31.5 degrees C. 3D-printed PFDH/calcium alginate (CA) microspheres have 210% relative enzyme activity after seven repeated uses. Dried PFDH/CA particles were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FT-IR), EDS elemental mapping, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) which proved that the enzyme was immobilized by the material. In addition, the recycling ability of 3D printing to immobilize different objects was explored and different shapes were designed by computer-aided design (CAD). In conclusion, 3D printing technology was applied to immobilize PFDH in this work, which provides a new idea to biodegrade formaldehyde in a green way.

AB The environmental questions emerged in recent decades have caused a transition from a linear economy, which involves the extraction of raw materials, production, distribution, consumption and final disposal of a good, to a circular economy (CE). CE is based on the reuse of materials in subsequent production cycles by extend-ing their useful life, with the aim of reducing and if possible, eliminating any waste. Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF), a 3D printing technique, has emerged in recent years as a promising methodology for green and sustainable purposes. The use of natural and biocompostable materials for the production of filaments for FFF, such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), has made this 3D printing technique one of the most promising in several fields. Furthermore, scientific research is focusing on improving the sustainability of primary materials used in 3D printing, through the development of composite filaments from green or recycled materials. This paper presents some applications concerning the development of innovative and sustainable materials focused on reducing the environmental impact of conventional FFF materials, carried out in recent years in our laboratories. In particular, various composite filaments incorporating poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and different handicraft or agro-industrial waste materials, including olive wood waste (OW), cocoa bean shell waste (CBSW), ceramic waste (CW) and Lecce stone waste (LSW), have been produced by extrusion. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on the innovative biocomposites devel-oped, including structural, morphological, thermal and mechanical evaluations, and the comparison of the results obtained with the different subproducts is presented in the paper. Finally, some simple real objects first reproduced manually, were later 3D printed using the developed biocomposite filaments, demonstrating the effectiveness of FFF in successfully recycling artisanal and agro-industrial waste within the same production company, reducing costs and supporting the CE.

AB The most significant challenge that the world is currently facing is the development of beneficial industrial applications for solid waste. A novel strategy was implemented to produce a composite with varying loadings of glass waste nanoparticles (GWNP) in 5, 10, and 15 wt.% with recycled polyethylene terephthalate drinking water bottle waste (RPET). This strategy was based on glass and drinking water bottle waste. An analysis was conducted to evaluate the performance of the composite as filaments for 3D printer applications. This study evaluated the effect of GWNP addition on the chemical structure, thermal and mechanical characteristics of the composite. The Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectra of the filament composites and RPET composites exhibited similarities. However, the mechanical strength and thermal stability of the filament composites were enhanced due to the increased GWNP content. Furthermore, the results indicated that the filament developed could be utilized for 3D printing, as demonstrated by the successful fabrication of the filament composite, including 5 wt.% GWNP, using a 3D printer pen. The production of filaments using GWNP and RPET matrix presents a cost-effective, high-yield, and ecologically beneficial alternative. The present study may pave the way for the future advancement and utilization of 3D printing filaments by treating hazardous waste and using more ecologically friendly materials in design applications.

AB Recent studies have shown that astronauts experience altered immune response behavior during spaceflight, resulting in heightened susceptibility to illness. Resources and resupply shuttles will become scarcer with longer duration spaceflight, limiting access to potentially necessary medical treatment and facilities. Thus, there is a need for preventative health countermeasures that can exploit in situ resource utilization technologies during spaceflight, such as additive manufacturing (i.e., 3D printing). The purpose of the current study was to test and validate recyclable antimicrobial materials compatible with additive manufacturing. Antimicrobial poly(lactic acid)- and polyurethane-based materials compatible with 3D printing were assessed for antimicrobial, mechanical, and chemical characteristics before and after one closed-loop recycling cycle. Our results show high biocidal efficacy (>90%) of both poly(lactic acid) and polyurethane materials while retaining efficacy post recycling, except for recycled-state polyurethane which dropped from 98.91% to 0% efficacy post 1-year accelerated aging. Significant differences in tensile and compression characteristics were observed post recycling, although no significant changes to functional chemical groups were found. Proof-of-concept medical devices developed show the potential for the on-demand manufacturing and recyclability of typically single-use medical devices using antimicrobial materials that could serve as preventative health countermeasures for immunocompromised populations, such as astronauts during spaceflight.

AB Additive Manufacturing has significantly impacted circular design, expanding the opportunities for designing new artifacts following circular economy principles, e.g., using secondary raw materials. Small-format 3D printing has reached a broader audience of stakeholders, including end-users, when dealing with filament feedstocks from plastic and biomass waste. However, using large-format extrusion-based additive manufacturing with recycled feedstocks remains challenging, resulting in limited applications and awareness among practitioners. This work analyzes the most relevant product applications using large-format material extrusion additive manufacturing with recycled plastics and biomass waste feedstocks. It reviews the case studies from 2010 to mid-2024 dealing with new materials and applications from academic research and practical contexts. The applications were analyzed to outline the current situation and trends for large-format 3D printing with recycled plastics- and biomass-based feedstocks, focusing on secondary raw materials, manufacturability, impact on product aesthetics, application fields, and products. Despite more consolidated sectors, new technical applications using granulate feedstock systems, e.g., transportation, are emerging. Academic research studies new secondary raw materials and distributed practices through large-format 3D printing. Practitioners are exploiting different approaches to design products, optimizing building times, costs, and material usage through different manufacturing strategies, strengthening the product identity by highlighting circularity. Spreading specific expertise could enlarge the range of application sectors and products, as well as foster real-world collaborations and scaling-up. Thanks to this work, new synergies between the research and practical contexts can be encouraged for new circular economy practices, detecting and exploring new scraps, material categories, or Additive Manufacturing processes in the future.

AB Wearable electronics have become an important part of daily lives. However, its rapid development results in the problem of electronic waste (e-waste). Consequently, recyclable materials suitable for wearable electronics are highly sought after. In this study, a conductive recyclable composite (PFBC) is designed based on a dynamic covalently cross-linked elastomer and hierarchical hybrid nanofillers. The PFBC shows excellent wide-ranging properties including processability, elasticity, conductivity, and stability, which are superior to previous materials used for recyclable electronics, and exhibits outstanding mechanical properties and environmental tolerance including high temperature, high humidity, brine, and ethanol owing to its covalent cross-linking. Reversible dissociation of Diels-Alder networks allows for convenient processing and recycling. After three recycles, the toughness of the PFBC remained at 10.1 MJ m(-3), which is conspicuous among the reported recyclable electronic materials. Three types of PFBC-based wearable electronics including a triboelectric nanogenerator, a capacitive pressure sensor, and a flexible keyboard, are successfully 3D printed with excellent performance. The PFBC possessed both recyclability and degradability, the combination of which provides a new way to reduce e-waste. This is the first work to recycle electronics using direct 3D printing and presents promising new design principles and materials for wearable electronics.

AB 3D Concrete Printing (3DCP) is a promising technology with significant advantages for the construction industry, encompassing reduced labor costs, diminished carbon dioxide emissions, enhanced time efficiency, improved user convenience, and design flexibility. To ensure optimal structural outcomes and resource efficiency, integrating numerical modeling and simulation is imperative for predicting structural behavior and identifying potential premature failures in 3DCP. Despite the recognized importance of this integration, the impact of different printing parameters on numerical models, particularly with variations in printing speed and printing layer, remains an unexplored area. This research delves into the influence of crucial printing parameters, specifically printing speed and nozzle diameter, on the buildability of 3D -printed structures within the built environment. A comprehensive experimental analysis is conducted on geopolymer-based 3D -printed structures, encompassing diverse process parameters associated with 3D printing (3DP) technology. A numerical model is deployed to predict the buildability of these structures, and its results are compared with experimental findings, assessing the efficacy of numerical modeling under varying printing parameter conditions. Rigorous characterization of input material properties is undertaken to ensure the accuracy of numerical simulations. Experimental results showcase favorable processability and buildability of geopolymer materials derived from novel Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW). Findings indicate that an increased nozzle size, reflected in greater layer height and width, positively influences buildability, whereas higher printing speeds correlate with reduced buildability. The numerical model successfully captures these buildability trends, though with an error ranging from 32 % to 45 % in predicting failure in 3D -printed structures. Nevertheless, the overall performance of the numerical model remains reliable in predicting the influence of printing parameters on buildability.

ID STABILITY
AB The moist heat (80 degrees C and 65% relative humidity) and light (xenon arc lamp) treatments of accelerated ageing were applied to investigate the colour stability of offset and electrophotographic prints on papers made of virgin and 100% recycled fibres. The prints were evaluated using spectrophotometric measurements and additional colour differences calculations. In addition to the colour differences, the 2D and 3D colour gamuts are presented. The results reveal the different colour stability of prints.
   The effect depends on the type of accelerated ageing, printing technique, composition of ink and paper characteristics. Moist heat ageing has less influence on colour stability than light ageing. The electrophotographic prints show better ageing resistance than offset prints. The influence of ink on print light fastness is considerable. Azo pigments in magenta and yellow have lower light fastness than phthalocyanine pigments in cyan or carbon black. The surface coating has an influence on light fastness of prints. Meanwhile, prints on recycled papers show similar colour stability compared to prints on papers made of virgin fibres.

ID SOFT MATTER
AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing is a prominent technology across various industrial sectors, and its increasing popularity urgently calls for sustainable 3D printing materials. However, the availability of such materials remains under exploit. Here, we present a low-cost strategy to harnesses waste papers as a feedstock to develop sustainable 3D printing inks. This approach offers a remarkable printability and circular utilisation of biodegradable paper wastes to produce 3D printed constructs, with desired mechanical properties and shape stability for high temperature applications. Our constructs can be efficiently recycled into inks for reprinting, and our method can be applied to various types of waste papers. By employing multi-material printing, our approach can be extended to produce multi-coloured constructs, security information printings, and mechanically appealing designs. This strategy offers an innovative and sustainable solution that addresses the need for repurposing paper wastes, which would otherwise end up in landfills, while concurrently reducing the reliance on virgin plastics for 3D printing.

AB Concrete 3D printing in the field of construction is rapidly developing in recent years. Some key aspects of mortars used in 3D printing include good extrudability and sufficient load-bearing capacity to support their own weight during the printing process. Thus, the rheological properties of the fresh mortar should be determined since they have to be comprised between certain values to make mortars suitable for 3D printing. In this study, a low-cost rotational rheometer has been developed to obtain the rheological characteristics of different mortar mixtures apt for 3D printing. In order to validate it, numerical simulations have been undertaken, which have shown a good correlation between the experimental and analytical results. Furthermore, a comparison with another commercial rheometer has been conducted using a mortar without fibers and a common testing protocol, showing results with similar variability to other proficiency tests undertaken with cement pastes. In addition, the rheological behavior of various sustainable mixtures incorporating recycled materials and different types of fibers was studied. The article further examines how the types, lengths, and percentages of fibers influence rheological parameters, establishing ranges suitable for 3D printing.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been widely identified as an emerging disruptive technology. This study examines how this technology could enable the circular economy by disrupting the existing materials value chain. Specifically, could this novel technology be used to locally manufacture new goods from local sources of recycled plastic waste, thereby offering benefits for the efficiency and effectiveness of materials cycling? This article uses the London metropolitan area-where system conditions already exist in the form of material flows, technology policy, and facilities- in order to assess 3D printing's viability as an enabler of a circular economy at the local level. An analysis of stakeholder perceptions identifies economic, technological, social, organizational, and regulatory barriers to mainstream implementation, and their likelihood of being overcome.

AB In this study, the Taguchi methodology was used to investigate the effects of Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) production parameters tensile strength, three-point bending strength, and impact strength of three-dimensional (3D) printed polylactic acid (PLA) and recycled polylactic acid (Re-PLA) test parts. As FDM process parameters, filaments (PLA, RePLA), three different layer thicknesses (0.15-0.20-0.25 mm), occupancy rates (30%, 50% and 70%), and filling structure (Rectilinear) were determined in the experimental design. The FDM technique was used to print the test parts. The tensile, three-point bending, and impact strength of the test parts were determined using the ISO 527, ISO 180, and ISO 178 test standards, respectively. The results showed that layer thickness is the most efficient factor for improving tensile strength, three point bending strength, and impact strength rather than occupancy rate or filament materials. The optimum results were obtained in layer thickness (0.25 mm), occupancy rate (70%), and filament material (PLA), respectively. They were calculated to be as 60.006 MPa at tensile strength, 125.423 MPa at three-point bending strength, 16.961 kJ/m2 at izod impact strength. Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) has been utilized to investigate the morphology and topography alterations in the fractured surface of test parts. The study demonstrates the possibility of 3DP with RePLA filament and environmental awareness was noted by using recycled filament. The study demonstrates the possibility of 3DP with Re-PLA filament and environmental awareness was noted by using recycled filament. The research shows that 3D printing with Re-PLA is feasible.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing with earth-based mortar is still under development and faces challenges. Optimising the mortar mixture, improving structural strength, determining the relationship between the printing speed and the amount of extruded material, and ensuring long-term durability are areas that are being refined. Additionally, regulatory and certification issues must also be considered to ensure the safety and compliance of 3D printed structures. This paper presents for discussion the records, analyses, studies, and considerations regarding initial initiatives involving 3D printing with the extrusion of earth-based mortar developed at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP). Through this work, it was possible to strengthen and reaffirm that 3D printing with earth-based mortar has significant potential in the construction industry and that the incorporation of dispersed kraft paper fibres from the recycling of cement bags is an excellent resource to achieve good constructability in 3D printing with earth-based mortar.

AB A form of laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) 3D printing has been used to manufacture the impellers of anode offgas recycle blowers (AORBs) for solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) applications. The material selected is Inconel 718, since it can endure the conditions and temperature ranges in which these systems typically operate. This paper presents details of the multiple process trials and the issues resolved to achieve a successful build, demonstrating the feasibility of the method for impeller manufacturing. Also discussed are the potential cost and design flexibility benefits that may be derived from 3D printing methods, particularly during integration of prototype and low count turbomachinery production runs. The paper discusses long-term goals of the project to support the reduction of cost of SOFC power plants by reducing the cost of balance of plant (BOP) subsystems, from design to integration.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), particularly 3D printing, has revolutionized numerous industries by enabling rapid prototyping and highly customizable production. However, its growing prevalence has led to significant accumulation of polymer-based waste, primarily from polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). This review provides a critical assessment of current recycling approaches-mechanical, chemical, and thermal decomposition-focusing on key metrics, including energy requirements, material recovery efficiency, contamination resilience, output quality, and industrial applicability. Mechanical recycling is notably energy-efficient (approximately 2.5 MJ/kg), but its effectiveness is hindered by polymer degradation and limited tolerance for mixed or contaminated waste streams. Chemical recycling, while capable of achieving high recovery rates (up to 90%) and superior output quality, demands substantial energy (similar to 7.8 MJ/kg) and specialized infrastructure, making it economically and technically challenging. Thermal decomposition methods such as pyrolysis can process heavily contaminated waste but lack circularity, as the resulting products are predominantly fuels. The review also examines emerging technologies, including enzymatic depolymerization, AI-driven sorting systems, and advanced upcycling techniques, evaluating their scalability, cost-effectiveness, and technology readiness levels (TRLs 4-7). Comparative benchmarking tables, life cycle assessment (LCA) data, and case studies from industries including aerospace and automotive illustrate the practical viability of these innovations. In conclusion, the review outlines strategic pathways for advancing sustainable additive manufacturing. These include the development of closed-loop recycling systems, the design of biodegradable additives, the implementation of extended producer responsibility (EPR), and the use of policy-driven incentives to promote circularity in 3D printing. Collectively, these measures aim to improve environmental outcomes while aligning with the technical and economic demands of industrial adoption.

AB Reduced environmental impact is commonly cited as a driver for additive manufacturing, but non-circular end-of-life disposition of the printed materials reduces these advantages. In particular, thermoplastics commonly used in material extrusion additive manufacturing (MEX) are not compatible with most recycling infrastructures; polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) is particularly problematic as it compromises the integrity of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) recycling streams. Thus, circular recycling of PETG within the MEX ecosystem is necessary, but the comonomer, cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM), content differs across commercial sources. Here, we demonstrate that the reduction in the viscosity of the PETG through multiple cycles of print-test-reprocess to filament (recycling) is dependent on the sourcing but not directly correlated with the CHDM content or molar mass. The elastic modulus and tensile strength of the printed PETG are not significantly impacted by recycling over 5 prints. However, the ductility of the printed PETG decreases after recycling one time for the lowest CHDM content PETG while the ductility first increases and then decreases through multiple reprocess cycles with higher CHDM content in the PETG. These results illustrate circular recycling through MEX may increase the number of cycles possible without significant degradation in part stiffness and strength when compared with mechanical recycling using traditional manufacturing methods.

AB The usage of plastics has become an inherent part of human life due to low cost, light weight, flexibility and ease of production. The degradation time for plastics is one of the major concerns currently the world is facing. According to the United Nations Sustainability Development (UNSD), a major percentage of currently available plastic must be either recycled or reused for a sustainable ecosystem. In this systematic review a methodology is presented to recycle the discarded plastics, metal, and ceramic scrap for the fabrication of composite filaments for material extrusion based 3D printing. The capabilities and recent progress in material extrusion based metal additive manufacturing are reviewed to identify the potential recyclable resources. The sustainable and entrepreneurial opportunities for recyclable materials for composite filament fabrication are discussed. It is observed that the composite filament must contain a minimum of 40 vol% reinforcement infill to make the printed parts eligible for sintering. The applications of the material extrusion based metal and ceramic additive manufacturing are detailed. The limitations, future directions and the possible improvements are explained. From this comprehensive review, it is expected that the reader will attain a proficient understanding of the sustainable process involved in fabricating metal and ceramic particle filled polymer composite filaments.

AB 3D printing with concrete has been accounted as a foremost strategy to mitigate low productivity, workforce shortage, and high waste generation in the construction industry. However, substantial environmental impacts related to high cement content in printable mixtures have received minor concern so far. An interesting prospect is the use of recycled concrete powders (RCP) to decrease cement content through their fineness and high specific surface area, which can potentially enhance rheological properties for 3D printing. However, their effects on cementitious mixtures greatly depend on their origin. This research investigated two distinct RCPs to replace 50% of Portland cement in pastes. On cementitious pastes, rotational rheometry, isothermal calorimetry, and a Life Cycle Inventory assessment were conducted. Printability tests on mortars evaluated the effects of RCP on extrudability and buildability. The results showed intensified early hydration for RCP pastes and up to a three-fold increase in static yield stress and higher dynamic yield stresses, regardless of origin. The viscosity of RCP pastes varied in relation to packing density. Extrudability and buildability can be compromised using RCP due to higher yield stress. The LCI assessment indicated a potential decrease of up to 62% in CO2 emissions using RCPs. Therefore, if adequate rheological adjustments are employed in the mix design of RCP mixtures, this material emerges as a feasible strategy to formulate 3D printable mixtures with a lower environmental footprint.

AB Vitrimers are a class of advanced polymeric materials characterized by their dynamic covalent networks, which offer unique properties such as self-healing, reprocessability, and shape memory. The integration of vitrimers into 3D printing technologies presents a significant advancement in the field of additive manufacturing, offering numerous benefits over traditional thermoplastics and thermosets. The use of vitrimers in 3D printing, leverages their ability to be cured and reformed under specific conditions, such as exposure to light or heat. Vitrimers enable the production of high-resolution parts that can be easily repaired or recycled, addressing key environmental concerns associated with traditional polymers. Their dynamic nature not only extends the life of printed components but also reduces waste and promotes sustainability by enabling the recycling of materials. Recent developments in vitrimers for 3D printing have focused on optimizing their performance, including enhancing mechanical strength, expanding the range of printable materials, and improving the efficiency of the printing process. Studies have demonstrated that vitrimers can achieve impressive properties such as high tensile strength, elasticity, and thermal stability, making them suitable for various applications. The continued research and development of vitrimers in 3D printing hold promise for advancing the capabilities of additive manufacturing, providing a pathway to more sustainable and versatile materials. By harnessing the unique properties of vitrimers, the industry can push the boundaries of what is possible in material design and functionality, leading to innovative solutions for complex engineering challenges. This article provides a comprehensive review of vitrimers reported in the literature and explores their use as potential materials in various 3D printing techniques.

AB To address the limitations of metal-organic frameworks for large-scale applications and the challenges associated with the heterogenization of heteropolyacids, we developed a catalytic monolith leveraging the encapsulation concept and 3D-printing technology. In this approach, a Keggin-type heteropolyacid was encapsulated within a Fe -based metal-organic framework through an in-situ method and subsequently incorporated into a 3D printing ink for the fabrication of a catalytic monolith. The monolith underwent comprehensive characterization, elucidating its morphological, structural, and mechanical features. Moreover, the catalytic performance of the 3D-printed monolith was thoroughly evaluated in Knoevenagel condensation reaction, highlighting its remarkable catalytic activity and exceptional recyclability. Characterization of the recycled catalyst, along with a hot filtration test, further confirmed the stability of the catalyst, the suppression of heteropolyacid leaching, and the manifestation of true heterogeneous catalysis.

AB Polymeric solid-solid phase change materials (SSPCMs) have garnered enduring attention due to the excellent latent heat and no encapsulation. However, the green manufacturing and recycling use of polymeric SSPCMs have long-term constraint on the development toward sustainable thermal energy storage. Moreover, 3D printing can help polymeric SSPCMs overcome shape limitations and optimize architectures, resulting in the customer-designed objects and effective thermal management. Herein, we proposed a novel strategy to facilely prepare the 3D printable, recyclable and adjustable comb/bottlebrush phase-change polysiloxane networks (Si-ODT-x). Wherein, the grafting crystalline alkyl chain content can effectively regulate the latent heat (from 24.9 J/g to 125.3 J/g), phase-change temperature (from 24.9 degrees C to 53.6 degrees C), thermomechanical and viscoelastic properties of networks. Besides, the degradation and recycling mechanisms were clarified. Moreover, Si-ODT-100 was exemplarily manufactured as a prototype with shape memory ability via 3D printing. Furthermore, the wearable, recyclable and multi-responsive phase-change composite was fabricated by Si-ODT-25 and carbon fiber cloth, which is suitable for the temperature management of human body. This study skillfully combines the tailorable phase-change ability of comb/bottlebrush networks, recyclability of polysiloxane as well as effective photo-induced thiol-ene click reaction, which will open up infinite possibilities for the thermal energy storage materials.

AB Three-dimensional printed functionally graded concrete (3D-FGC) represents a viable approach for integrating structural and functional elements through tailored material distributions. Two gradient configurations were developed using recycled aggregates (RAs) and polyethylene (PE) fibres. We systematically investigated the printability, mechanical properties, and thermal conductivity of 3D-FGC, supported by microstructural analysis. The findings seek to elucidate the potential mechanisms of impact related to diverse material distributions. The results show that the linear gradient effectively positions the fibres in the tensile zone, resulting in a significant increase in flexural properties and material efficiency, with a peak flexural strength of 6.0 MPa and a thermal conductivity of 0.61 W & sdot;m-1 & sdot;K-1. The liner gradient (LG) specimens exhibited higher porosity (8.38 %) and rougher pore surfaces compared to sandwich gradient (SG) samples. Microcracks with reduced widths (from 1.8 mu m to 0.8 mu m in fiber-reinforced regions) were observed, alongside weak interfacial transition zones (ITZ) between recycled aggregate (RA) and cement. The LG specimen exhibits a multi-stage crack pattern, with densely distributed cracks appearing in the tensile region, which is a primary contributor to enhanced bending performance. The gradient designs demonstrate strong potential for applications requiring tailored mechanical and thermal properties, such as prefabricated and on-site printed structural elements. In conclusion, this work paves the way for innovative design strategies in the additive manufacturing of functionally graded concrete.

AB The growing demand for sustainable and high-performance sensors has driven the development of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) sensing technologies utilizing innovative material combinations. This study developed cutting-edge H2O2 sensors by integrating 3D printing technology and materials like silver nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, recycled battery powder, and biodegradable polymers such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA) (5%, 10%), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (5%, 10%). The cyclic voltammetry analysis demonstrated that electrodes with 10% PVA exhibited superior electrocatalytic activity and sensitivity for detecting H2O2 compared to PLA-based electrodes. This innovative approach addresses environmental concerns associated with electronic waste, enhancing sensor durability and electrochemical efficiency.

AB Additive manufacturing, or 3D printing, in energy storage devices such as batteries has the potential to create new form factor small cells that are incorporated into the shape of the device at the design stage. With large-scale proliferation, sustainable and recyclable materials are needed to avoid used cell waste accumulation, and the cells should have performance metrics that match or exceed existing cells. Inspired by safe aqueous battery chemistries and development in stereolithographic photopolymerization printing methods such as vat polymerization (Vat-P), a 3D-printed aqueous lithium-ion battery developed, using sustainable active cathode and anode materials of LiMn2O4 and FePO4 center dot 2H(2)O, which can be fully recycled using a simple combustion method. This battery is designed to allow a stable cycling, higher energy density option compared to a metallic cell of similar construction, and to ensure better intraelectrode electrical conductivity and rigidity necessary for a viable cell, avoiding brittleness sometimes found in all-in-one composite-printed electrodes. The printed cell has a stable cell-level capacity of 1.86 mAh, better than that of a comparable metallic coin cell of similar internal chemistry, with an average cell voltage just over 1.0 V. Following combustion, the crystalline phase of LiMn2O4 and a mixed phase of some Fe2O3 mixed with a dominant composition of FePO4 are recovered. All inorganic materials are recovered after combustion.

AB The unique process of making 3D printed food packaging from agricultural waste is one of the most emerging ways of sustainable, biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging. This is happening because of the merging of two technologies, 3D printing and recycling/upcycling of agricultural waste. New useable materials will be created and further utilized for food packaging. The technique involves collecting all agricultural waste and then combining it into printable media with the capacity of extrusion technology from a 3D printer, moulding food packaging products. Flour, cellulose, and lignin in agricultural waste are easily converted to biopolymers that serve as base materials for 3D printing. Generally, such biopolymers are required to blend with additional materials for strength and durability. So, this technology utilizes agricultural waste as an eco-friendly substitute for conventional petroleum-based plastics, ultimately contributing to a significant reduction in the environmental impact caused by food packaging. Processing agricultural waste into printed materials involves extensive processing steps like drying, grinding, and blending. The development of better composite materials from agricultural wastes with better mechanical and barrier properties is an ongoing research area. The reproduction technology is evolving into a faster and more efficient means of printing, making it eventually applicable to extensive food packaging applications. The technology utilizes much available agricultural by-product waste to create more sustainable alternatives to conventional packaging materials while giving elbow room for customizing functional food packaging designs. The study's aim was to analyse the kinds of biopolymers and natural filler types used in the formulation of 3D printing filaments from agro-industrial wastes for food packaging applications. This work investigates the effects of processing methods on the physicochemical parameters of the 3D printed composites used in food packaging.

AB PurposeThis study aims to evaluate the mechanical and microstructural attributes of 3D-printed recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) produced through fused deposition modeling (FDM). Given the environmental concerns surrounding plastic waste, this research focuses on optimizing the reuse of polymeric materials to produce consumable products and provide these materials with a second life. By examining the effects of various FDM parameters, this study seeks to identify the optimal settings to enhance the mechanical properties and surface quality of rPET.Design/methodology/approachThis research involves recycling polyethylene terephthalate (PET) through an element extrusion process to create filaments suitable for additive manufacturing via FDM. This study systematically investigates the influence of five FDM parameters - build orientation, layer height (Lh), printing orientation (Op), infill pattern (Ip) and printing speed (Sp) - on the mechanical properties [tensile strength (TS), impact strength (IS), hardness (H) and surface roughness (Ra)] of the rPET. Microstructural analyses are performed using optical and scanning electron microscopy to correlate mechanical properties with microstructural features. The significance of these parameters is further examined using analysis of variance and multivariate analysis of variance.FindingsThis study concludes that optimal parameter settings significantly enhance the mechanical properties of 3D-printed rPET. Specifically, a maximum TS of 29 MPa and IS of 0.27 J are achieved with Lh of 0.10-0.15 mm, Sp of 70-100 mm/sec and Op of 80 degrees-90 degrees. Maximum hardness (68 HV) is observed at layer heights of 0.25-0.30 mm, printing speeds of 90-100 mm/sec, and orientations of 80 degrees-90 degrees. Microstructural analysis reveals that high-strength samples exhibit ductile fracture with prominent elongation (3.91%), whereas low-strength samples display brittle fracture with less elongation (3.08%).Originality/valueThis study provides valuable insights into the recycling of PET for additive manufacturing, demonstrating the potential of rPET in producing high-quality 3D-printed parts. By optimizing FDM parameters, the research highlights the feasibility of transforming waste materials into valuable products, contributing to environmental sustainability and waste management. The findings offer a practical guide for industries and researchers seeking to enhance the mechanical performance and surface quality of 3D-printed recycled materials.

AB Using solid waste-based materials, such as recycled building aggregate (RCA), preparing 3D-printed materials can reduce costs but increase the water-cement ratio of the printed material, which reduces its mechanical performance. In order to solve the problem of mechanical properties decline caused by an increase in the w/c ratio, this experiment found that adding calcined salt mud (CSM) to the printing materials and changing the water-to-cement ratio from 0.37 to 0.4 CSM can ensure that the compressive strength of the printing materials remains basically unchanged. Moreover, through TG, SEM, and other microscopic data, it can be seen that calcium hydroxide in CSM can not only participate in the synergistic reaction of ethylene/vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) and dust ash (DA), produce more NaOH, and promote the hydration of granulated blast furnace slag (GBFS) but also promote the formation of ettringite together with SO42- in solution, optimizing pore size distribution.

AB Improving the surface roughness quality of 3D printed components, especially metallic ones, which are fabricated from the selective laser melting (SLM) method, has drawn enormous attention from the research community. It should be noted that various studies on this topic have reported that precise surface roughness results can be obtained with various techniques that are indeed not cost-effective. Differing itself from these studies, this manuscript investigates an economical solution for fabricating and surface treating SLM components. Specifically, the inspected specimens were printed with recycled 316L stainless steel powder and treated solely with two abrasive surface finishing methods. In the manuscript, two scanning strategies namely meander and stripes, and three types of surfaces were investigated. Subsequently, their 2D and 3D surface roughness results were elaborated. After the proposed herein abrasive treatment, 3D surface roughness arithmetical mean height of a surface (Sa) value of 0.9 mu m can be achieved.

AB This paper presents the first 3D-printable antenna with fully recyclable and re-usable metals, for sustainable RF communication applications. The proposed antenna consists of a fully 3D-printed substrate made from biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA). It features an asymmetric monopole that provides a maximum measured broadband operation range from 1.8 GHz to 3.2 GHz and is fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) structure. The conductive components (i.e., the radiator, feed line, and ground plane) are fabricated using liquid metal. A repeatable method for filling the channels with liquid metal is developed, allowing the conductive components to be fully recycled and refilled. The effectiveness of the recycling process is verified by consistent measurement results, the difference of bandwidth between which is less than 3%.

AB In the current study, we examine the effect of using natural and recycled coarse aggregates in designing 3D printable concrete. We assessed the rheological behaviourusing a dynamic shear rheometer, and it was observed that the addition of coarse aggregates significantly decreased the yield stress and marginally lowered the plastic viscosity. This was attributed to the increase in the paste and water film thickness with the addition of larger aggregates. Therefore, a reduction in the superplasticizer dosage is required to obtain coarse aggregate mixtures with similar yield stress and buildability to the control mixture. The mechanical properties were evaluated by using beam and cube samples cut out from printed wall elements. A marginal decrease in compression and flexural strength was observed for both the mixtures with natural and recycled coarse aggregates. The total and autogenous shrinkage assessment was performed using mould cast prismatic specimens, while the shrinkage cracking potential was evaluated using the restrained ring test. The coarse aggregate mixtures showed lower total and autogenous shrinkage. Notably, the addition of the saturated recycled aggregates significantly lowered the autogenous shrinkage, possibly due to internal curing. As a result, a relatively lower strain rate factor and slower development of tensile stresses occurred in the restrained shrinkage test, increasing the cracking age for the coarse aggregate mixtures. The current study, therefore, shows good potential for using natural and recycled coarse aggregates in 3D printable concrete.

AB A multifunctional photoinitiator is presented, offering precise control over light-induced polymerization initiation at 450 nm and material degradation at 365 nm. This is accomplished by covalently linking photoactive bis(acyl)phosphane oxide and photocleavable o-nitrobenzyl ether moieties onto the surface of gamma-cyclodextrin. Upon degradation, the resulting linear polymers can be easily re-dissolved in their corresponding monomer and re-cured, exhibiting superior mechanical properties compared to the pristine material. Moreover, this photoinitiator enables the successful 3D printing of intricate and precise structures, representing a promising general strategy for developing recyclable photoresins for 3D printing applications.

ID TRANSPARENT CONDUCTIVE ELASTOMERS
AB The current multi-color digital light processing (DLP) relies on different dyes and complex resin exchange/ cleaning equipment to fabricate multi-color objects. Here, we developed a novel and simple approach to print multi-color objects using a conventional DLP printer with acrylic acid (AA)/ZnCl2/H2O (AZH)-based polymer-izable deep eutectic solvents (PDESs) and type I photoinitiators, eliminating the need for dyes. The coloration of the printed objects is achieved by the molecular isomerization of type I photoinitiators remaining in the cured material. Furthermore, the color tuning range of the printed objects with this approach is close to the full-color gamut. Another advantage of this approach is that the printed objects can be recycled and reused to prepare the precursor solution for new multi-color DLP printing, making it a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly method. Finally, the potential application of multi-color objects in information encryption and decryption has been demonstrated, which opens new possibilities for the use of multi-color DLP printing in security and other areas. This novel multi-color DLP printing strategy utilizing residual photoinitiators represents a significant advancement in 3D printing technology, offering a simpler, more flexible, and more sustainable approach to achieving multi-color printing.

AB Additive manufacturing technology is renowned for its ability to produce components on demand. Presently, the development of sustainable materials has been promoted by Green Chemistry, leading to an increase in the recycling of polymers and other materials for use in 3D printing. In this work, we proposed the construction of a 3D printed electrochemical device using a conductive paste made from 3D printing residues of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filaments and graphite to develop a sustainable sensor for acebutolol detection using square wave voltammetry method. The electrode was characterized using imaging and electrochemical techniques, demonstrating superior electrochemical performance compared to a commercial device. The method exhibited excellent analytical performance with a linear working range from 0.98 to 51.8 mu mol L-1 and good detectability (detection limit) of 0.28 mu mol L-1. Furthermore, the recycled sensor demonstrated good precision with a relative standard deviation of less than 8.4 % and good accuracy with recovery percentages ranging from 93 to 107 % for monitoring acebutolol in urine and tap water samples. Additionally, the device was free from interference from the matrix and other commonly used drugs, making it suitable for electroanalytical applications and extremely promising.
   Additive manufacturing technique enables on-demand production of components and, when combined with green chemistry, promotes the use of sustainable materials in 3D printing. In this study, we utilized ABS waste and graphite to fabricate electrochemical sensors. The sensor developed with recycled material showed performance comparable to commercial devices in the determination of acebutolol, making it a promising option for electroanalytical applications. image

ID CIRCULAR ECONOMY
AB Since the take-make-dispose model is leading to significant waste production and environmental impact, circular economy models have been spreading to reduce waste and resource depletion, rethinking the existing resource cycles. Plastic waste created environmental and economic concerns, requiring new recycling methods and strategies to preserve resources. This practice plays a key role in extrusion-based additive manufacturing, con -verting waste into recycled feedstock. Large-format additive manufacturing represents a promising way to scale up recycling strategies with granulated polymer feedstock, especially considering popular materials, i.e., PLA. However, thermomechanical degradation affects the quality of this secondary raw material, and these effects on large-format systems are scarcely studied. This work investigates the thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of PLA feedstock for large-format additive manufacturing after multiple recycling processes, i.e., up to six. The effect of material degradation from multiple recycling processes was assessed through Gel Permeation Chromatography, Differential Scanning Calorimetry, flow stress ramp tests, tensile tests, and colorimetry. Some 3D printed parts were fabricated to assess the overall quality of the process, including pieces from potential applications. Lower effects of thermomechanical degradation were found compared to desktop-size 3D printers, mainly by cutting the reprocessing steps to produce secondary raw materials, i.e., making new filaments. Recycled granulate PLA feedstocks represent a potential alternative to virgin pellets for new applications in real -world contexts.[copyright information to be updated in production process].

AB PurposeThis study evaluates the potential of using the material extrusion (MEX) process for recycling waste tire rubber (WTR). By investigating the process parameters, mechanical behaviour and morphological characterisation of a thermoplastic polyurethane-waste tire rubber composite filament (TPU-WTR), this study aims to establish a framework for end-of-life tire (ELT) recycling using the MEX technology.Design/methodology/approachThe research assesses the impact of various process parameters on the mechanical properties of the TPU-WTR filament. Hysteresis analysis and Poisson's ratio estimation are conducted to investigate the material's behaviour. In addition, the compressive performance of diverse TPU-WTR triply periodic minimal surface lattices is explored to test the filament suitability for printing intricate structures.FindingsResults demonstrate the potential of the TPU-WTR filament in developing sustainable structures. The MEX process can, therefore, contribute to the recycling of WTR. Mechanical testing has provided insights into the influence of process parameters on the material behaviour, while investigating various lattice structures has challenged the material's capabilities in printing complex topologies.Social implicationsThis research holds significant social implications addressing the growing environmental sustainability and waste management concerns. Developing 3D-printed sustainable structures using recycled materials reduces resource consumption and promotes responsible production practices for a more environmentally conscious society.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the field by showcasing the use of MEX technology for ELT recycling, particularly focusing on the TPU-WTR filament, presenting a novel approach to sustainable consumption and production aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12.

AB Many hydrogen-bonded cross-linked hydrogels possess unique properties, but their limited processability hinders their potential applications. By incorporating a hydrogen bond dissociator (HBD) into these hydrogels, we developed injectable 3D printing inks termed diffusion-induced phase separation (DIPS) 3D printing inks. Upon extrusion into water and subsequent diffusion of HBD, these ink cure rapidly. The DIPS-printed scaffold retained most of the original hydrogel properties due to the regeneration of hydrogen bonds. Additionally, the reversible nature of hydrogen bonds provides DIPS 3D-printed scaffolds with exceptional recycling and reprinting capabilities, resulting in a reduction in the waste of valuable raw ink materials or additives. Postprocessing introduces new crosslinking methods that modulate the mechanical properties and degradation characteristics of DIPS scaffolds over a broad range. Based on its suitable mechanical properties and bioactivity, we successfully repaired and functionally reconstructed a complex defect in penile erectile tissue using the DIPS scaffold in a rabbit model. In summary, this approach is relevant for various hydrogen-bonded cross-linked hydrogels that offer mild printing conditions and enable the incorporation of bioactive agents. They can be used as scaffolds for dynamic tissue reconstruction, wearable devices, or soft robots.
   Herein, we present a method for creating novel extruded 3D printing inks using hydrogen-bonded cross-linked hydrogels, called DIPS 3D printing. Urea acts as a switch for the gel-sol transition of DIPS inks, enabling fast, high-fidelity 3D printing under mild conditions. The printed DIPS scaffold can be used as a tissue-engineered scaffold for dynamic organ repair.image

AB Background: Ecological research often involves sampling and manipulating non-model organisms that reside in heterogeneous environments. As such, ecologists often adapt techniques and ideas from industry and other scientific fields to design and build equipment, tools, and experimental contraptions custom-made for the ecological systems under study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing provides a way to rapidly produce identical and novel objects that could be used in ecological studies, yet ecologists have been slow to adopt this new technology. Here, we provide ecologists with an introduction to 3D printing.
   Results: First, we give an overview of the ecological research areas in which 3D printing is predicted to be the most impactful and review current studies that have already used 3D printed objects. We then outline a methodological workflow for integrating 3D printing into an ecological research program and give a detailed example of a successful implementation of our 3D printing workflow for 3D printed models of the brown anole, Anolis sagrei, for a field predation study. After testing two print media in the field, we show that the models printed from the less expensive and more sustainable material (blend of 70% plastic and 30% recycled wood fiber) were just as durable and had equal predator attack rates as the more expensive material (100% virgin plastic).
   Conclusions: Overall, 3D printing can provide time and cost savings to ecologists, and with recent advances in less toxic, biodegradable, and recyclable print materials, ecologists can choose to minimize social and environmental impacts associated with 3D printing. The main hurdles for implementing 3D printing-availability of resources like printers, scanners, and software, as well as reaching proficiency in using 3D image software-may be easier to overcome at institutions with digital imaging centers run by knowledgeable staff. As with any new technology, the benefits of 3D printing are specific to a particular project, and ecologists must consider the investments of developing usable 3D materials for research versus other methods of generating those materials.

AB Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a popular additive manufacturing (AM) method for creating thermoplastic parts with intricate geometrical designs. Pure thermoplastic materials utilized in FFF, whose polymeric matrix is reinforced with other materials, such as carbon fibers (CFs), introduce products with advanced mechanical properties. However, since not all of these materials are biodegradable, the need for recycling and reuse immediately emerges to address the significant problem of how to dispose of their waste. The proposed study evaluates the printability, surface morphology and in vitro toxicity of two thermoplastic-based composite materials commonly used in wearable device manufacturing to provide enhanced properties and functionalities, making them suitable for various applications in the field of wearable devices. Tritan Copolyester TX1501 with 7.3% chopped CFs (cCFs) and Polyamide 12 (PA12) with 8.6%cCFs and 7.5% iron Magnetic Nanoparticles (MNPs)-Fe4O3 were used in the discrete ascending cycles of recycling, focusing on the surface quality performance optimization of the printed parts. Through stereoscopy evaluation, under-extrusion, and over-extrusion defects, as well as non-uniform material flow, are assessed in order to first investigate the influence of various process parameters' application on the printing quality of each material and, second, to analyze the optimal value fluctuation of the printing parameters throughout the recycling cycles of the materials. The results indicate that after applying certain adjustments to the main printing parameter values, the examined recycled reinforced materials are still effectively 3D printed even after multiple cycles of recycling. A morphology examination using scanning electron microscope (SEM) revealed surface alterations, while a cytotoxicity assessment revealed the adverse effects of both materials in the form of cell viability and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in the cell culture medium.

AB Polymer composites (PCs) are increasingly used in civil infrastructure and construction due to their high strength, lightweight properties, and durability. When combined with automated manufacturing technologies such as 3D printing, they enable the efficient fabrication of complex engineering structures while minimizing material waste. As construction moves toward sustainable, automated, and digitally driven methods, understanding the potential of 3D-printed polymer composites becomes essential. This review addresses this emerging need by offering a civil-infrastructure specific synthesis of polymer composites in additive manufacturing as a pathway to a more sustainable and resilient built environment. The paper presents a comprehensive overview of the use of PCs in automated construction, highlighting key 3D printing techniques and printable polymer-based materials applied in building and infrastructure projects. It also discusses recent developments, current challenges, and emerging opportunities in PC-based 3D printing for civil engineering, supported by case studies, innovative construction methodologies, and future research directions.

AB This study concentrates on the potential recycling and cleaner conversion of marine industry wastes such as crab shell wastes as particles in the development of novel polylactic acid (PLA) biocomposite filaments for 3D printing applications. The filaments were extruded with varying extrusion process parameters such as extruder speed (20, 30, 40, and 50 mm/s), extrusion temperature (170, 175, 180, and 185 degrees C), environmental conditions (no, air, and water medium), and crab shell particle concentration (0, 1, 5, 7, and 10%). The quality of the extruded biopolymeric composite filaments is accessed in terms of filament tensile strength and average diameter. The results concluded that the optimized conditions for achieving better tensile strength and average filament diameter will be an extrusion speed of 40 mm/s, extrusion temperature of 180 degrees C, environmental condition of water medium, and crab shell particle concentration of 7%. The extrudability and wind ability results show that the PLA/crab shell (7%) composite has passed the quality checks which makes it suitable for large-scale production. For the proof of concept of converting the filament to product development, the extruded filaments like neat PLA and PLA/crab shell (7%) composite filaments are used for the 3D printing process via the fused filament fabrication (FFF) method. The various mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural, compression, impact strength, and contact angle measurement were made on the novel 3D-printed composites. The results proclaimed that the addition of crab shell particles of 7% has shown the maximum tensile and flexural strength of 38.09 MPa and 28.43 MPa respectively than the neat 3D-printed PLA polymer composite. And also, the 3D-printed PLA/crab shell (7%) composite shows a decrease in the contact angle of 29 degrees. This indicates that the developed novel composite material is more suitable for the development of biopolymeric components. It is recommended that the use of 3D printing with recyclable biomaterials is more suitable for the development of bio-scaffold and bone graft material preparation in a cleaner and sustainable way.

AB As a notable commercial aquaculture species, channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) in US faces challenges including the global market competition and enhanced feed costs. Since fish bone waste is a major source of calcium and hydroxyapatite, re-utilization gives birth to several advanced products in the development of animal feed, fertilizers, and nutrition supplements. Recent research findings introduce fish bone powder (FBP) reinforcement in Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) of plastic composites. However, FBP so far has not been widely utilized for Direct Ink Writing (DIW) 3D printing of silicone composite. In this paper, catfish bone waste has been recycled and processed with a thermal procedure. FBP reinforced silicone composite structures have been developed and manufactured using low-viscosity DIW 3D printing. Morphological and chemical structures of FBPs were analyzed and compared before and after calcination. The rheological and mechanical characterization have indicated the potential of calcinated FBP in advancing the silicone composites. With 0%-50% weight percentages of FBP, composite samples can be designed to get any specified mechanical response (0.5-1.4 MPa in 50% tension strain and 150-550 N in 30% compression strain). The shape holding, overhang, and dimensional accuracy of FBP reinforced silicone composites in single (DIW) and dual (FDM + DIW) 3D printing processes have been demonstrated and summarized. With appropriate adjustments, this FBP-based 3D printing technology can be applied to byproduct recycling of all the US food-fish species, poultry, and livestock.

AB Consumer-grade plastics can be considered a low-cost and sustainable feedstock for fused filament fabrication (FFF) additive manufacturing processes. Such materials are excellent candidates for distributed manufacturing, in which parts are printed from local materials at the point of need. Most plastic waste streams contain a mixture of polymers, such as water bottles and caps comprised of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP), and complete separation is rarely implemented. In this work, blends of waste PET, PP and polystyrene (PS) were processed into filaments for 3D printing. The effect of blend composition and styrene ethylene butylene styrene (SEBS) compatibilizer on the resulting mechanical and thermal properties were probed. Recycled PET had the highest tensile strength at 35 +/- 8 MPa. Blends of PP/PET compatibilized with SEBS and maleic anhydride functionalized SEBS had tensile strengths of 23 +/- 1 MPa and 24 +/- 1 MPa, respectively. The noncompatibilized PP/PS blend had a tensile strength of 22 +/- 1 MPa. PP/PS blends exhibited reduced tensile strength to ca. 19 +/- 1-3 MPa with the addition of SEBS. Elongation to failure was generally improved for the blended materials compared to neat recycled PET and PS. The glass transition was shifted to higher temperatures for all of the blends except the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend. Crystallinity was decreased for the blends, but was highest in the 75-25 wt. % PP/PS and the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET blend with SEBS-maleic anhydride. Solvent extraction of the dispersed phase revealed polypropylene was the matrix phase in both the 50-50 wt. % PP/PET and PP/PS blends.

AB This study determines the effect of spent garnet as a replacement for natural sand in 3D-printed mortar at early ages. Five mixes with different spent garnet amounts were prepared (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% by volume). The ratio of binder to aggregate remained unchanged. In all mixes the water/binder ratio was assumed as a constant value of 0.375. Tests were performed to confirm the printability of the mix (a path quality test using a gantry robot with an extruder). Determinations of key buildability properties of the mix (green strength and Young's Modulus) during uniaxial compressive strength at 15 min, 30 min and 45 min after adding water were conducted. A hydraulic press and the GOM ARAMIS precision image analysis system were used to conduct the study. The results showed that an increase in spent garnet content caused a decrease in green strength and Young's Modulus (up to 69.91% and 80.37%, respectively). It was found that to maintain proper buildability, the recommended maximum replacement rate of natural sand with garnet is 50%. This research contributes new knowledge in terms of using recycled waste in the 3D printing technology of cementitious materials.

AB Each year, a significant amount of waste is produced from carbon fiber polymer composites at the end of its lifecycle due to extensive use across various applications. Utilizing regenerative carbon fiber as a feedstock material offers a promising and sustainable approach to additive manufacturing based on materials. This study proposes the additive manufacturing of recycled carbon fiber with a polyamide-12 polymer composite. Filaments of recycled carbon fiber-reinforced polyamide-12 (rCF-PA12) with different recycled carbon fiber contents (0%, 10%, and 15% by weight) in the polyamide-12 matrix are developed. These filaments are utilized for 3D printing of specimens by using various infill density parameters (80% and 100%) on a fused deposition modeling 3D printer. The study examined how the fiber content and infill densities influenced the flexural performance of the printed specimens. Notably, the part containing 15 wt% recycled carbon fiber (rCF) composites showed a significant improvement in flexural performance due to enhanced interface bonding and effective fiber alignment. The results indicated that reinforcing the printed part with 10% and 15 wt% recycled carbon fiber (rCF) improved the flexural properties by 49.86% and 91.75%, respectively, compared to the unreinforced printed part under the same infill density and printing parameters. The investigation demonstrates that the additive manufacturing-based technique presents a potential approach to use carbon fiber-reinforced polymers waste and manufacture high-performance engineering, economic, and environmentally friendly industrial applications with the complicated design using different polymer matrices.

AB Fab labs, which offer small-scale distributed digital fabrication, are forming a Green Fab Lab Network, which embraces concepts of an open source symbiotic economy and circular economy patterns. With the use of industrial 3D printers capable of fused particle fabrication/fused granular fabrication (FPF/FGF) printing directly from waste plastic streams, green fab labs could act as defacto recycling centers for converting waste plastics into valuable products for their communities. Clear financial drivers for this process have not been studied in the past. Thus, in this study the Gigabot X, an open source industrial 3D printer, which has been shown to be amenable to a wide array of recyclables for FPF/FGF 3D printing, is used to evaluate this economic potential. An economic life cycle analysis of the technology is completed comprised of three cases studies using FPF for large sporting equipment products. Sensitivities are run on the electricity costs for operation, materials costs from various feed stocks and the capacity factors of the 3D printers. The results showed that FPF/FGF 3D printing is capable of energy efficient production of a wide range of large high-value sporting goods products. In all cases, a substantial economic savings was observed when comparing the materials and energy related costs to commercial goods (even for customized goods). Using locally-sourced shredded plastic represented not only the best environmental option, but also the most economic. For the case study products analyzed even the lowest capacity factor (starting only one print per week) represented a profit when comparing to high-end value products. For some products the profit potential and return on investment was substantial (e.g. over 1000%) for high capacity use of a Gigabot X. The results clearly show that open source industrial FPF/FGF 3D printers have significant economic potential when used as a distributed recycling/manufacturing system using recyclable feed stocks in the green fab lab context.

AB Most earlier studies on distributed recycling additive manufacturing (DRAM) have focused on using recycle-bots-waste plastic extruders-to produce raw materials for fused fluid fabrication (FFF). In the present study, an innovative recycling method designed explicitly for post-consumer water bottles was introduced and evaluated for its effectiveness in producing high-quality PET filament. The PET material was thoroughly characterized before and after filament production and following the 3D printing process. This approach successfully preserved the crystallinity of PET and prevented its thermal degradation. Key parameters, including infill density, printing speed, and layer thickness, were investigated using Taguchi's method in conjunction with Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) to optimize the printing of recycled PET. This methodology aimed to maximize Young's modulus and tensile strength while minimizing printing time and material usage. The results highlighted a trade-off between mechanical performance and printing efficiency. The best mechanical properties were achieved with a layer thickness of 0.1 mm and 100% infill density, yielding a tensile strength of 30 MPa and a Young's modulus of 2311 MPa-values comparable to commercially available recycled PET and PLA filaments.

AB The manufacturing of machine parts with additive methods (AM) is of significant importance in modern industry. The development of 3D printers and all 3D printing technology is impressive. The ability to make parts quickly and relatively cheaply with AM gives excellent opportunities in terms of e.g., shortening the production preparation time. Proper selection of printing parameters allows for a significant reduction of printing time and production costs. Unfortunately, this has different consequences. Due to the course of the printing process and the parameters that can be set, the same product produced with different parameters has different mechanical properties - mainly different strength. This paper presents the impact of 3D printing parameters on the strength of manufactured parts. Strength tests were carried out on samples made in accordance with DIN EN ISO 527-1:2019. The samples were printed in technology FDM from three different materials, i.e. PLA (completely biodegradable), PETG (recycled material) and Smart ABS (material with minimal shrinkage). The tested samples were made in three levels of print filling - 10, 30 and 60% and with different types of filling - line, mesh and honeycomb. A series of static tensile tests were carried out to determine the strength of the samples produced with different printing parameters. Thanks to the obtained test results, it is possible to select the optimal printing parameters depending on the forecast load of the manufactured parts.

ID DESIGN
AB Additive manufacturing, such as the 3D printing of composite materials for electronics is rapidly evolving, enabling the production of advanced electric and magnetic composites with tailored properties. These materials require special printing conditions and advanced control to maintain the desired material properties during the 3D printing process and in the final product design. Hence, determining the heating and energy consumption and estimating the efficiency of 3D printing is essential. This work modeled the fused filament fabrication 3D printing of composite materials with a polymer carrier matrix. A 3D time-dependent thermal model of a 3D printer extruder was developed and implemented using the finite element method to study and improve the efficiency of 3D printing. As the filler content influences the operational parameters and process energy consumption of the 3D printing process, the transient heating process parameters were estimated using different composite modifier contents. Two types of modifiers were considered: Fe2O3 and CaO, both mixed in a PLA carrier material. The volumetric fill ratio of the two modifiers did not exceed 45%, as the mixing dependency of the material properties is linear in this range. The power fluxes and power efficiency were estimated. The results provide new possibilities for better control methodologies and advanced additive manufacturing for new materials in electronics. Operational control can accelerate the 3D printing process, speeding up the heating of 3D-printed composite materials and reducing the printing time and total energy consumption. Furthermore, this research provides directions for new advanced 3D printing extruder designs with better power and energy heating efficiency.

AB 3D concrete printing (3DCP) technology has grown substantially in recent years and expanded from use in the development of architectural landscapes to the manufacture of load-bearing structures. The durability perfor-mance of 3D-printed concrete materials is crucial for the application of 3DCP in engineering structures. In this study, polypropylene (PP) fibre-reinforced sulfoaluminate cement-based composites were prepared for 3D printing, and their mechanical and durability performances after exposed to a sulfate-attack environment were experimentally assessed. The surface damage, mass loss, dynamic modulus, and residual strength of the prepared 3D-printed concrete were quantified during 150 cycles of sulfate attacks. The damage anisotropy of 3DCP exposed to sulfate attacks was introduced and elucidated from both the meso-and microscales. The pore characteristics of the matrix and interfaces were investigated through computerised tomography (CT) scanning and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to uncover the influence of interfaces on the sulfate resistant perfor-mances. The results indicate that the damage anisotropy of 3DCP after exposed to sulfate attack was reduced due to the self-healing properties of sulfoaluminate cementitious composites.

AB The use of 3D printing technology for manufacturing new products based on sustainable materials enables one to take advantage of secondary raw materials derived from recycling. This work investigates the structural performances of 3D printing composite filaments based on polylactic acid (PLA), as a matrix, reinforced by recycled carbon fiber (rCF). Carbon fibers were recovered from industrial scraps by a patented thermal process and used to produce thermoplastic composite filaments for additive manufacturing without any additional treatment and additives. The influence of the recovered carbon fiber (rCF) content on the thermal properties, mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites was studied in the range of 3-20 wt%. The recorded TGA curves exhibited a one-stage weight loss within the temperature range 290-380 degrees C for all samples and the residual rCF content was in good agreement with the theoretical fiber loading. The Young modulus of the extruded filaments strongly increased below a critical content (5 wt%), while at higher content the improvement was reduced. An increase in the storage modulus of 54% compared to neat PLA 3D printed sample resulted in a printed specimen with a higher rCF content. SEM images highlighted a strong rCF prevailing alignment in the direction of the extrusion flow, creating almost unidirectional reinforcement inside the filament. These findings suggest that homogeneous composite filaments reinforced with well-dispersed recycled CF without additional chemical modification and additives are suitable materials for additive manufacturing. The effect of rCF topological distribution within the material on the mechanical performances has been discussed, highlighting that the isolated fibers could efficiently transfer loads with respect to the percolated 3D network and have been correlated with the microstructure.

AB A new low-carbon material for 3D concrete printing by utilizing recycled ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) and clay brick powder (CBP) was developed to reduce the carbon footprint. The printability and hardened properties of 3D printed mortar were systematically investigated to reveal the coupling effect of GGBS and CBP. The results indicate that the printability of mortar is significantly influenced by the morphology and particle size distribution of admixtures. The vitreous surface of GGBS reduces the yield stress of the paste, while the porous surface of CBP has the opposite effect. Furthermore, increasing CBP replacement leads to a denser packing of binders, which releases more free water to increase the fluidity of mortar. The printing process not only increases the proportion of capillary and macro pores, but also reduces the sphericity of macro pores. As a result, 3D printed mortar experiences a 10 - 50 % loss in compressive strength and mechanical anisotropy of 3D printed mortar. The secondary hydration reaction of GGBS and CBP reduces the average pore diameter from 41.7 nm to 15.3-19.3 nm and increases the complexity of micro pores, resulting in a significant decrease in chloride ions migration in the mortar. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using low-carbon materials containing GGBS and CBP for 3D concrete printing.

AB In this review article, system materials for concrete 2D printing have been discussed, along with the various other aspects that are connected to sustainable construction. The article consists of an introduction giving the background of manufacturing that started almost two decades ago, including the non-conventional methods of building structures. It has been seen that there are various stainable materials in the field of 3D printing in construction, as the conversion of construction to 3D printing reduces waste generation. Further in this article, the cost comparison between conventional and non-conventional construction methods has been discussed, including the effectiveness of 3D printing; 3D printing is very effective in the sense that it requires the precise use of machinery and construction material. Full-scale 3D printing has also been seen in the building sector, but only to some extent. Some of the components of bridges, and even some of small bridges, have been constructed using 3D printing and ultra-high-performance concrete. Since there are various advantages to 3D building, there are also various disadvantages to 3D printing, such as how much it costs and finding the materials that are suitable for 3D printing, which might increase the cost. Polymers have also been used in 3D printing construction since polymers have a very long lifespan, and polymers may increase the strength of the final product by reinforcing the aggregate. Additionally, this technology gives us the opportunity to use various materials together for construction, such as recycled aggregates and geopolymers, along with concrete and cement, which might pose some challenges but are being used nowadays. A major concern with this technology is its impact on the labor market. Since in traditional construction huge amounts of man hours are required, concerns have been raised about the inclusion of this technology, as this might affect employment. Since most of the work will be done by machines, the need for labor will reduce. These are some of the issues that need attention. Finally, this article discusses the novelty and future scope of 3D printing in the construction sector, and concludes by outlining the scope of potential developments for 3D printing concrete by taking into account sustainability.

AB Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) one of the recyclable thermoplastics having insulating properties is being widely used as a 3D-printed substrate for Bluetooth sensing devices. But hitherto little has been reported on the 4D capabilities of 3D-printed recyclable ABS substrate-based sensors. This study reports the rheological (melt flow), mechanical (tensile), morphological (surface hardness, roughness (Ra), porosity, etc.), 3D printability, and radio frequency (RF) characteristics of primary recycled ABS substrate. Further, the 3D-printed ABS substrate samples were exposed to two different stimuli (chemical and thermal) for 10 cycles/stages to ascertain the effect on RF characteristics for ensuring 4D capabilities. The 3D-printed Bluetooth sensor has been designed for 2.45 GHz. The simulated results of the 3D-printed prototypes were verified experimentally using a vector network analyzer (VNA), which shows the appreciable response with a minimal frequency shift, thus ensuring the applicability of such sensors for Bluetooth applications. The percentage variation in the dielectric constant has been recorded to a maximum of 8% (in stage 9) and a minimum of 2% (in stage 6). Also, the dissipation factor of the substrate has been recorded to remain constant (similar to 0.0045) indicating a factor of repeatability and hence the usability of such materials for 4D printing applications. Morphological analysis on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) reveals that the Ra of the 3D-printed ABS substrate was significantly improved (50-19 nm), hence ensuring better performance of the fabricated sensors.

AB Partially replacing cement with recycled brick powder (RBP) in 3D printing concrete (3DPC) is an effective way to reduce carbon footprint and resolve the construction and demolition waste disposal problems. Understanding the impact of RBP on the rheological parameters of 3DPC is of utmost importance, given its critical role in ensuring the requisite printability. Here, three types of RBPs with various particle features were prepared by mechanical grinding, and their effects on several rheological parameters of cement-RBP pastes were characterized by hydration kinetic and water state distribution. Results show that incorporating RBP increases the growth rate of static yield stress due to the nucleation effect in the first 2 h. The initial static yield stress and thixotropy of cement-RBP pastes are governed by morphology effect and Debye length, while the mean interparticle distance and water lubrication effect under shear process play the dominant role in dynamic yield stress. RBP can promote the evolution of structural build-up and thixotropy of cement paste, all of which have a significant positive impact on filament shape retention and structural stability of 3DPC.

AB Iron oxide scale generally forms on low-carbon steel surfaces during the hot rolling processes and produces as solid waste more than 100 thousand tons per year. The utilization of the iron oxide scale is one possible way to reduce the production cost for steel plants and promote environmental protection. Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrol-Copolymer (ABS) is widely used as engineering plastic for automotive parts because of its high strength and wear resistance. The recycling of iron oxide waste as reinforcement particles for enhancing the tensile strength of ABS composite was studied. The iron oxides were recycled by carbon powder at a high temperature between 1150 & DEG;C to 1350 & DEG;C up to 120 min. After the reduction process, the reduced iron from an optimal condition with the iron-rich fraction was ground to powder. Afterward, the 0.3 vol% to 1.3 vol% powders were mixed with ABS polymer powder and formed as composite filaments for additive manufacturing (FDM 3D printing). The tensile strength of pure ABS filament increased to 37.16 & PLUSMN; 2.37 MPa when added recycled iron powders. The regular distribution and 13.68 & PLUSMN; 9.78 & mu;m of recycled-iron particle sizes on the ABS matrix were investigated and correlated to the mechanical properties.

AB This study investigates the use of fly ash, limestone calcined clay (LC2), and RESIN8 (from recycled plastics) fine aggregate for sustainable 3D concrete printing. Four different printable mixes were formulated and tested for their fresh, rheological, and hardened mechanical properties and evaluated for extrudability and buildability performance. They are the control (C), which is a fly ash-cement-based mix, LC2-cement-based mix (LC), and two mixes with RESIN8 replacing the sand by 10 % vol., yielding CR (control + 10 % RESIN8) and LCR (LC2 + 10 RESIN8). The findings from this study show that both LC2 and RESIN8 mix improved the fresh properties for printability - reduced slump, increased yield stress and its evolution, shape retention, and buildability. The LC2 has dual benefits of improving the pumpability and buildability, which are opposing printable materials' requirements. Furthermore, the use of LC2 in 3DPC causes the fresh material to be susceptible to increased deformation under sustained load, which can be improved with the addition of RESIN8. Incorporating 10 % RESIN8 into C- and LC-printed concrete systems reduced the workability by 3.8 % (CR) and 1.9 % (LCR) and enhanced buildability performance from 46 (C) to 59 (CR) and 74 (LC) to 90 (LCR) number of layers. Contrary to LC2, which improves the hardened properties and interlayer bond strength in flexure, the use of RESIN8 causes strength reduction and decreased void topology (28 % for LCR) and significantly increased porosity by 210 % and 259 % for CR and LCR, respectively.

ID PHOTOPOLYMERIZATION
AB Vat polymerization, one of the 3D printing technologies, has been widely applied owing to its advantageous properties, such as high accuracy and surface quality. However, the applicability of this technology is limited to end-use product manufacturing, requiring advancements due to a gradual increase in the performance requirements and functional demands of the products. In this study, deep eutectic solvent-based photocurable resins (PCRs) with synergistic hydrogen bonding are synthesized using a facile and ecofriendly procedure to tune monomer proportions. The as-prepared PCRs, with ultralow viscosity and ultrahigh curing rate, are compatible with commercial liquid-crystal display printers. The 3D-printed parts with high optical transparency, stiffness, and thermal resistance exhibit humidity dependent electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. In addition, the 3D-printed objects demonstrate self-healing features due to the synergistic effect of high-density hydrogen bonding in the microphase-separated polymer matrix. Moreover, different categories of structural assembly, from 2D to 3D and small to large, are demonstrated, and their solubility ensued in recycling and remolding. The synthesized PCRs are suitable for fabricating sacrificial molds, enabling the on-demand fabrication of precise multifunctional structures with various materials, which are otherwise incompatible with UV-based 3D printing, facilitating 3D printing by overcoming its material-selection limitations.

AB Repurposing plastic waste is crucial to cope with the global population and rapid industrialization. Most plastic waste generated worldwide is mismanaged, leading to plastic pollution, landfill congestion, and microplastic contamination. Circular economy practices in the sustainable production and consumption of plastic are urgently needed to address these challenges, bringing plastics into closed-loop manufacturing and utilization. Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing (3DP) have the potential to complement these efforts by facilitating on-demand, decentralized and flexible manufacturing using recycled plastics. In pursuit of circular materials for 3DP, this study investigates the influence of infill design and density on tensile and dynamic mechanical properties of 3D-printed recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) sandwich structures. rPET filaments were produced using waste plastic bottles and were used for the 3DP process to produce sandwich structure coupons. In the first phase, the rPET filaments were tested for their mechanical properties revealing an average tensile strength of 111.99 MPa, failure strain of 1.20, and Young's modulus of 199.61 MPa, followed by the 3DP of tensile testing coupons with varying infill patterns (grid, tri-hexagon, octet, concentric, gyroid, and solid) and infill densities (25%, 50%, and 75%). The 3D-printed sandwich structures were evaluated for their dimensional stability and mechanical properties. All patterns demonstrated good dimensional stability, with minor variations from the CAD model. The mechanical properties of the concentric pattern at 50% infill (C50) stand out as the best among all infill types and patterns, exhibiting an average tensile strength of 34.65 MPa, failure strain of 0.067, Young's modulus of 464.32 MPa, and strength-to-weight ratio of 8.56 (S/W). In the final phase, the optimal infill pattern and density (i.e., C50) were also tested for their dynamic mechanical properties. The outcomes of this study will assist future research in developing robust 3D-printed parts using rPET, and the comprehensive approach presented in this study can be further adapted to develop novel recycled plastic waste-based composites for broader applications.

AB Developing 3D printable waste paper based biocomposites is a potentially greener alternative to traditional waste paper recycling methods. In this paper, waste office paper (WOP) filled polylactide acid (PLA) biocomposites were prepared as filaments for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF). The morphology, rheology, thermal properties, and physical properties of PLA-WOP composites were investigated. Results revealed that the addition of WOP improved the composites' melt flow abilities. The T-g and T-m of composites remained similar to the neat PLA. However, tensile strengths of the prints decreased with the increase of WOP content, which could be attributed to the heterogeneous dispersion and aggregation caused by the abundance of WOP in the system. When 5% WOP was used, the elongation at break increased in comparison with pure PLA specimens. Nonetheless, when the WOP content was increased to 15%, the elongation at break decreased. To improve the mechanical properties of the prints, a silane coupling agent (gamma-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxylsilane, KH570) was used to modify WOP granules. The mechanical properties were clearly enhanced post KH570 treatment. Furthermore, FTIR analyses demonstrated that the hydrogen bonding improved interfacial adhesion between WOP fillers and the PLA matrix. Thermal decomposition showed that the PLA-WOP composites had virtually no degradation below 260 degrees C, indicating that the composite filaments are safe for indoor 3D printing.

AB Material extrusion (MEX) is an additive manufacturing process used for 3D printing thermoplastic-based polymers, including single polymers, blends, and reinforced polymer composites (RPCs). RPCs are highly valued in various industries for their exceptional properties. The surface finish of RPC MEX-printed parts is high due to the process-related layering nature and the materials' properties. This study explores RPC development for MEX printing and the potential of dry milling post-processing to enhance the MEX-printed part's surface quality. RPC MEX filaments were developed by incorporating graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and/or recycled-carbon fibers (rCFs) into a polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. The filaments, including pure PLA and various GNPs-PLA composites, rCF-PLA, and rCF-GNPs-PLA, were developed through ball mill mixing and melt extrusion. Tensile tests were performed to assess the mechanical properties of the developed materials. Dry milling post-processing was carried out to assess the machinability, with the aim of enhancing the MEX-printed part's surface quality. The results revealed that adding GNPs into PLA showed no considerable enhancements in the tensile properties of the fabricated RPCs, which is contrary to several existing studies. Dry milling showed an enhanced surface quality of MEX-printed parts in terms of surface roughness (Sa and Sz) and the absence of defects such as delamination and layer lines. Adding GNPs into PLA facilitated the dry machining of PLA, resulting in reduced surface asperities compared to pure PLA. Also, there was no observation of pulled-out, realigned, or naked rCFs, which indicates good machinability. Adding GNPs also suppressed the formation of voids around the rCFs during the dry milling. This study provides insights into machining 3D-printed polymer composites to enhance their surface quality.

AB To promote natural waste resource utilization, a novel biocomposite, composed of waste crab shells and poly (lactic acid) matrix, was developed by combining chemical treatment and 3D printing. A crab shell powder (ISCSP) with an abundant porous structure and a high specific surface area was obtained by treatment with hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. Importantly, under the optimal printing parameters determined by the finite element analysis, test samples, and porous bones were successfully printed using CSP/PLA composites by a commercial fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer. The morphology, mechanical and thermal properties, antibacterial properties, and biocompatibility of the CSP/PLA composites were then assessed. Our results revealed that the tensile strength and flexural strength of the ISCSP/PLA composites reached 58.71 and 90.11 MPa, which were 28.6 % and 28.8 % higher than that of pure PLA, respectively. The glass transition and melting temperatures of the composites remained similar to those of pure PLA. Interestingly, the addition of CSP increased PLA crystallinity, which could be attributed to the nucleation effect of CSP in the system. The antibacterial activity of the PLA-1.5ESCSP composite samples against Escherichia coli (E. coli) was greater than 99 %. More importantly, the live/dead assay showed that the CSP/PLA composites possessed excellent biocompatibility. Therefore, the developed CSP/PLA biocomposites are potential feedstocks for 3D printing in bone tissue engineering and may be used as graft substitutes in reparative and reconstructive surgery. They are especially beneficial due to their superior mechanical and thermal properties, excellent antibacterial activities, and significant biocompatibility.

AB The high cost of 3D printing feedstock is primarily attributed to the conversion of raw polymers into filament, which also directly impacts the mechanical, optical, and structural integrity of printed components in the fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. To address this limitation, a novel oblique (semi-vertical) filament extrusion system was developed, offering an affordable and compact solution for producing customized filaments from virgin, composite, and recycled materials. The system occupies approximately 2 m2, costs between USD 600-1000, and achieves filament diameter control within +/- 1.71% to +/- 5.8% deviation, depending on the material. Key extrusion parameters-nozzle diameter, outlet angle, screw pulse interval, puller motor speed, and nozzle temperature-were experimentally optimized using regression modeling, with a predictive error range of 1.71-6.48% for filament diameter. Mechanical testing of 3D printed specimens confirmed strong material performance, with ultimate tensile strengths of 53.84 MPa (PLA), 29.15 MPa (TPU), and 22.18 MPa (PLA + TPU 50/50). The system also successfully processed recycled PLA and Nylon-12 powder, highlighting its material versatility and potential for circular manufacturing. Overall, this work demonstrates a scalable, low-cost, and sustainable filament fabrication method that enhances FFF capabilities for research, education, and small-scale industry.

AB In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) porous calcium alginate (3D CA) scaffold was successfully constructed using a direct-ink-writing-based 3D printing method combined with an in-situ calcium ion cross-linking procedure. The 3D CA contained orderly aligned microstructures with excellent structural robustness and an abundant number of active binding sites. The adsorption experiments verified that 3D CA had a considerably wide pH value (3-10) serving range, but also delivered a significantly higher adsorption capacity for U(VI) (117.3 mg/g at pH = 2.5) under acidic conditions, compared to other previously reported alginate-based porous adsorbents. The adsorption mechanisms originated from the synergistic effect of electrostatic interactions and ion exchange. The 3D CA eluted the adsorbed U(VI) in a strong acid solution through protonation mechanism, facilitating the continued enrichment and recycling of U(VI). In addition, the 3D CA demonstrated good microstructure stability and absorption capacity stability when it was immersed in hydrochloric acid solutions at different concentrations (3.6 x 10(-3) to 2 mol/L) for 24 h. Therefore, the 3D CA could be used for the removal and recycling of U(VI) from acidic solutions beyond its wide pH working range, due to its stronger acid stability and higher U(VI) adsorption capacity.

AB The excessive use of materials that are generally difficult to discard, such as stone materials, has caused growing ecological concern. Among these, marble is extracted from quarries, but when the raw material is exhausted, these places are deserted. For this reason, several measures have been adopted in recent years to requalify these areas. In addition, recent technological developments involve the creation of innovative green materials that privilege the circular economy and waste recycling. This research presents the development of innovative, sustainable filaments for the fused filament fabrication (FFF) printing technique from recycled marble waste (MW) and biocompostable and biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) matrix. MW was added to the polymer in concentrations of 10 wt.%, 20 wt.%, and 30 wt.%, and the blends were extruded to develop innovative green filaments. The chemical/structural properties of the raw materials and the thermal and mechanical features of the new composites were investigated. Composites containing 10 and 20 wt.% of MW showed good printability. In contrast, extrusion and printing difficulties were observed with 30 wt.% of MW. Finally, this paper proposes a project to renaturalize and requalify a disused marble quarry located in Trani (Apulia, Italy) with 3D printing devices using the newly produced eco-filaments, which have better features. The main purpose of this article is to propose a concrete, economic, and sustainable application of 3D printing involving processes such as waste and by-product recycling and renaturalization of disused quarries, with both economic and environmental benefits.

AB This paper focuses on the 3D printing of Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS) reinforced with 5 and 10 wt% recycled carbon fiber (rCF), alongside its neat counterparts, using material extrusion additive manufacturing. Moreover, the addition of 10% rCF significantly improved crashworthiness by over 60% compared to engineered PPS plastic. Young's modulus and impact strength were enhanced by 78 and 64%, respectively, compared to the neat sample. The temperature at which half of the sample's weight degrades increased by 50 degrees C compared to the unreinforced PPS. Additionally, the printed parts displayed excellent chemical resistance, with fluid uptake of less than 1% and a mere 10% reduction in tensile strength after one week of immersion in automobile chemicals. These findings suggest that the developed PPS/10rCF has the potential to be a noteworthy candidate in 'under-the-hood' applications. This advanced manufacturing of functional materials, based on reclaimed carbon fiber, underscores the diverse capabilities of recycled materials in producing high-value products across various sectors, including transportation, appliances, electronics, energy storage devices, and building construction.

AB Recycling of construction and demolition wastes (CDW) for the development of intelligent construction materials has the potential to lower the environmental burden and promote the development of intelligent construction. Herein, CO2 pretreatment to a type of recycled fine aggregate (RFA) was employed to upcycle the waste for developing 3D printable mortar (3DPM). The replacement ratios of natural fine aggregates (NFA) by recycled fine aggregates (RFA) and carbonated recycled fine aggregates (CRFA) up to 100% were designed, and the engineering properties, including compressive strength, flexural strength and interlayer bonding strength, of 3DPM were investigated. Comprehensive microscopic tests with X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-backscattered electrons (SEM-BSE), and X-ray computed tomography (X-CT), were used to demonstrate the microstructure mechanism of the 3DPM specimens with upcycled fine aggregates at the microscopic level. Systematical enhancements in engineering properties of 3DPM with CRFA were reported when compared with those of 3DPM with RFA. The compressive strength at 28 days was noticeably enhanced by 68.5% for the 3DPM with 100% upcycled fine aggregates. Carbonation enables significant calcite precipitates in the adhered cement paste area and formation of cement hydrates in the new cement paste area. The findings of the present work not only deepen the understandings in the microstructure alterations of RFA by CO2 pretreatments, but also pave a path towards the upcycling of CDW towards sustainable intelligent constructions.

AB The innovation of multi-material offers significant benefits to architectural systems. The fusion of multiple materials, transitioning from one to another in a graded manner, enables the creation of fused space without the need for mechanical connections. Given that plastic is a major contributor to ecological imbalance, this research on fused space aims to recycle plastic and use it as a multi-material for building applications, due to its capacity for being 3D printed and fused with other materials. Furthermore, to generate diverse properties for the fused space, several nature-inspired forming algorithms are employed, including Swarm Behavior, Voronoi, Game of Life, and Shortest Path, to shape the building enclosure. Subsequently, digital analyses, such as daylight analysis, structural analysis, porosity analysis, and openness analysis, are conducted on the enclosure, forming the color mapping digital diagram, which determines the distribution of varying thickness, density, transparency, and flexibility gradation parameters, resulting in spatial diversity. During the fabrication process, Dual Force V1 and Dual Force V2 were developed to successfully print multi-material gradations with fused plastic following an upgrade to the cooling system. Finally, three test sites in London were chosen to implement the fused space concept using multi-material.

AB Fused deposition modeling (FDM) three-dimensional (3D) printing is commonly used by small factories, entrants, and families owing to its ease of use and speed. However, certain studies have shown that during the manufacturing process, particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are harmful to the respiratory system, and that carbon emissions associated with energy consumption can contribute to global warming. These studies considered only virgin filaments and not recycled filaments. Considering the importance of plastic recycling for achieving circular economy targets, the sustainability of recycled filaments much be investigated. This study used grey relational analysis to determine the multi-objective optimal printing parameters for virgin and recycled filaments on the human health and carbon emissions impacts and thus provide a reference for the "circularization" of filament materials. The experimental results indicate that the orientation angle, layer height, and heatbed temperature are the three most important parameters affecting human health and carbon emissions in recycled filaments. The optimal printing parameters showed an improvement of 20.24 % for all objectives, and the PM reached 54.02 %. Furthermore, based on a life-cycle assessment, the use of optimal printing parameters can decrease lifecycle emissions by 21.7 %.

AB Fused filament fabrication (FFF) is a 3D printing technology that has been successfully demonstrated aboard the International Space Station (ISS), proving its suitability for space applications. In this study, we aimed to apply FFF to the 3D printing of recycled space beverage packaging, made of LDPE and a PET-Aluminum-LDPE (PAL) trilaminate. To minimize material waste and optimize the experimental process, we first conducted numerical simulations of additive manufacturing. Using Digimat-AM 2021.1 software, we analyzed residual stresses and warpage in an LDPE/PAL composite with a 10 wt% filler content, processed through the FFF technique. Three key printing parameters, including printing speed and infill pattern, were varied across different levels to assess their impact. Once the optimal combination of parameters for minimizing residual stresses and warpage was identified, we proceeded with the experimental phase, printing objects of increasing complexity to validate the correlation between numerical predictions and the 3D-printed models. The successful fabrication of all geometries under optimized conditions confirmed the numerical predictions, particularly the reduction in warpage and residual stress, validating the material's viability for additive manufacturing. These findings support the potential application of the LDPE/PAL composite for in situ resource utilization strategies in long-term space missions.

AB Eco-friendly concrete becomes research hotspots since concrete production emits 8-10% of the total anthropogenic CO2 emissions worldwide. Industry solid waste modification exhibits great potentials on mitigating aggregates depletion and carbon emissions. Coal gangue aggregate (CGA) coated by silica fume manually (CGACM) and in a desiccator (CGACD) are utilised to optimize the 3D printing concrete. Specimens were printed by a 3D printing robotic arm with a 25 mmdiameter nozzle. The compressive strength of CGACM and CGACD increases by 49% and 44% than non-activated series. For splitting tensile strength, the figures are 43% and 36%. The density of activation series decreases over 16% compared with standard sand. However, both surface pretreated methods make negative effects on structure compactness. From the SEM, SiO2 particles filles defects of aggregates, resulting in a denser internal structure and promoting secondary hydration reaction. However, excessive SiO2 particles agglomerated on CGA leads to the lubricant film among particles. These results expand recycle methods for CG and promotes 3D printing technology application on mine.

AB This study investigates the printability of concrete with recycled fine aggregates (RFA) for 3D concrete printing (3DCP). RFA was used to replace conventional fine aggregates - crushed stone sand (CS) at 30 %, 50 %, and 100 % levels. Both rectangular and cylindrical hollow specimens were printed to evaluate mix printability. The methodology combined systematic printing trials, rheological assessments, and advanced computer vision (CV) monitoring. Before printing, rheological assessments were done to check the feasibility of the mix. During printing, inline cameras were used to record layer-wise deformations and surface textures to assess printability. Rheological characterisation indicated that higher RFA content increased initial static yield stress (from 1.69 to 1.86 kPa) and accelerated structural recovery. This enabled the construction of a 1 m cylindrical specimen while reducing deformation from 4 % to 0.8 %. Despite the improved buildability, mechanical property evaluation indicated that a 50 % RFA replacement level optimally balanced rheological performance with compressive strength, achieving 44.6 MPa at 28 days, approximately 3-4 % higher than RFA-30 and markedly superior to RFA-100, where higher replacements significantly reduced compressive strength. Flexural strength increased with delayed printing, correlating with increased surface texture. Additionally, water sorptivity rose with higher RFA content due to increased pore connectivity and aggregate porosity. Compared to the control mix (14.4 x 10-4 g/mm2 & sdot;h0.5), sorptivity increased by 21.9 %, 33.8 %, and 72.1 % for RFA-30, RFA-50, and RFA-100, respectively. The integrated approach of inline computer vision and pre-printing rheological assessments produced consistent results, underscoring the reliability of the printability performance of 3DCP.

AB The huge labour-consumption, construction and demolition (C&D) waste pollution, and shortage of river sand have become increasingly serious problems facing the construction industry. Therefore, the possibility of fully replacing natural fine aggregates (NFA) with recycled fine aggregates (RFA) for fiber-reinforced 3D mortar printing (3DMP) was carefully evaluated by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) technique, mechanical testing, and microscopic analysis in this study. The results show that the 100% replacement of RFA had very limited impact on the failure pattern of the 3D printed (3DP) specimen, while the addition of 1% polyethylene (PE) fibers would change the failure pattern of specimens from brittle to ductile. This study also defines the parameter of anisotropic degree to reflect the anisotropy. It is found that the anisotropic degree of 3DP specimens was different under various loading conditions and obviously affected by both RFA and fibers. The microscopic analysis indicated that the effect of RFA on the 3DP specimens was mainly due to the porous structure and the existence of initial micro-cracks, while the effect of fibers was mainly due to the interfacial bond between PE fibers and matrix. This study also found that after reinforcing with appropriate fibers, the 3DP mortar mixed with 100% RFA has higher mechanical properties and better deformation ability than the fiber-free mortar with 100% NFA. It is believed that the 100% replacement of RFA is applicable in 3DMP, which will bring significant benefits to the cleaner production and sustainable development of the construction industry.

AB Ti6Al4V printing particles have been recently used for fabricating orthopedic implants. Removing these particles completely from fabricated implants is challenging. Furthermore, recycled particles are commonly used in fabrication without additional analysis. Ti6Al4V wear particles derived from orthopedic implants are known to induce inflammatory responses and osteolysis. However, the biosafety of printing particles remains unknown. Here, we investigated the proinflammatory and osteolysis-inducing effects of commonly used original and recycled Ti6Al4V printing particles in vitro and in vivo. Our results indicated that although less serious effects were induced compared to wear particles, inflammatory responses and osteoclast-mediated bone resorption were induced by the original printing particles in a particle size-dependent manner. Recycled particles were found to more strongly stimulate bone resorption and inflammatory responses than the original particles; the in vivo effect was enhanced with an increase in particle concentration. Furthermore, the results of our in vitro experiments verified that the printing particles activate macrophages to secrete inflammatory cytokines and promote osteoclastogenesis, which is closely related to particle size and concentration. Taken together, our findings provide a valuable reference for the use of raw printing materials and examination of recycling procedures for implant fabrication.

AB Studying the durability of materials and structures, including 3D-printed structures, is now a key step in better meeting the challenges of sustainable development and integrating technical and economic aspects from the design phase into the execution phase. While digital and robotics technologies have been well developed for construction 3D printing, the material aspect still faces critical issues to meet the evolving requirements for buildings. This research aims to develop performance indicators for 3D-printed materials used in construction regardless of the nature of the material. A general guideline is to be established as a result of this research. Thus, the literature review analyzes traditional durability approaches to construction materials and challenges are identified for potential applications in construction. The results suggest that performance indicators for 3D-printed materials should be checked as printable through an experimental case study. This research could be of interest to researchers, professionals, and start-ups in the construction and materials research fields.

AB This paper proposes a conceptual framework for implementing blockchain technology to enhance traceability, transparency, and authenticity of a 3D printed product. An implementation framework is developed using blockchain technologies to record and trace critical attributes during the various life cycle phases of a 3D printing value chain, viz. raw material extraction, chemical processing, polymerization, filament production, 3D printing, and end-of-life recycling of the product. The information on critical attributes of carbon footprint, workers' age, and material flow during the entire value chain is captured to provide authentic output of carbon footprint and labour age during any of the value chain activity. The uniqueness of the current work lies in offering a series of immutable transactions using blockchain technology to comprehend the circularity of 3D printing material and account for the overall carbon footprint produced by a 3D printed product considering its whole value chain. This would improve the traceability and visibility of the material supply chain for 3D printing. On the hindsight, the proposed framework is expected to assist the manufacturing firms to act as responsible manufacturers by providing the authentic data for the computation of environmental assessment as well as social issues of child labour throughout the value chain.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing has various applications in many fields, such as soft electronics, robotic systems, biomedical implants, and the recycling of thermoplastic composite materials. Three-dimensional printing, which was only previously available for prototyping, is currently evolving into a technology that can be utilized by integrating various materials into customized structures in a single step. Owing to the aforementioned advantages, multi-functional 3D objects or multi-material-designed 3D patterns can be fabricated. In this study, we designed and fabricated 3D-printed expandable structural electronics in a substrateless auxetic pattern that can be adapted to multi-dimensional deformation. The printability and electrical conductivity of a stretchable conductor (Ag-RTV composite) were optimized by incorporating a lubricant. The Ag-RTV and RTV were printed in the form of conducting voxels and frame voxels through multi-nozzle printing and were arranged in a negative Poisson's ratio pattern with a missing rib structure, to realize an expandable passive component. In addition, the expandable structural electronics were embedded in a soft actuator via one-step printing, confirming the possibility of fabricating stable interconnections in expanding deformation via a missing rib pattern.

AB In this study, recycled powder (RP) was used to partly replace cement to produce the sustainable 3D printed mortar (3DPM). The properties of fresh 3DPM with RP of different replacement ratio (10%, 20% and 30%) were studied by conventional tests and 3D printer. At first, the flowability, setting time, mechanical property and hydration heat of fresh 3DPM with RP were investigated. Then 3DPM with RP was extruded and built by 3D printer to study the extrudability and buildability. The results show that the incorporation of RP in 3DPM leads to higher flowability losing rate with time, shorter open time, shorter initial and final setting time as well as rapid growth of penetration resistance stress with time. The maximum stress and the Young's modulus of fresh 3DPM grow linearly with time at a lower replacement ratio, while there is a rapid growth when the replacement ratio is higher than 20%. Compared with 3DPM without RP, the maximum stress and Young's modulus of 3DPM with 30% RP are increased 226.5% and 252.2% at 180 min, respectively. The addition of RP enhances the heat evolution rate and hydration heat in 8 h after mixing with water. The well correlation of hydration heat and fresh properties is obtained, which indicates that RP can be used in 3DPM to enhance the early age mechanical properties and buildability. 3DPM with 10%-30% RP has good extrudability and buildability.

AB The pursuit of sustainable practices in manufacturing has become increasingly imperative in addressing environmental concerns and resource scarcity. One promising avenue is using waste materials within a circular economy framework. This paper presents an economically viable 3D-printed setup for additive manufacturing feedstock using waste bottles. The process begins with collecting and preparing waste bottles, which are sorted, cleaned, and cut into uniform strips suitable for extrusion. The plastic strips are transformed into filaments using a hotend volcano nozzle suitable for use in 3D printers. This approach effectively demonstrates the principles of a circular economy, where waste is converted into a resource. Utilizing 3D printing technology allows for the fabrication of custom components at a relatively low cost, minimizing the initial investment required for implementation. By maximizing resource utilization and minimizing energy consumption, the setup reduces operational costs and enhances its overall sustainability. The proposed 3D-printed setup offers a practical and cost-effective solution for producing additive manufacturing feedstock from waste bottles within a circular economy framework. Repurposing waste materials into valuable resources addresses environmental and economic challenges, contributing to the transition towards a more sustainable future.

AB Polyolefin thermoplastics like high density polyethylene (HDPE) are the leaders in terms of world-scale plastics' production, environmentally benign polymerization processes, recycling, and sustainability. However, additive manufacturing of HDPE by means of fused deposition modeling (FDM) also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF) has been problematic owing to its massive shrinkage, voiding and warpage problems accompanied by its poor adhesion to common build plates and to extruded HDPE strands. Herein we overcome these problems and improve Young's modulus, tensile strength and surface quality of 3D printed HDPE by varying 3D printing parameters like temperature and diameter of the nozzle, extrusion rate, build plate temperature, and build plate material. Both nozzle diameter and printing speed affect surface quality but do not impair mechanical properties. Particularly, an extrusion rate gradient prevents void formation. For the first time additive manufactured HDPE and injection-molded HDPE exhibit similar mechanical properties with exception of elongation at break. Excellent fusion of the extruded polymer strands and the absence of anisotropy are achieved, as verified by microscopic imaging and measuring the tensile strength parallel and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction.

AB As a key hemicellulase, xylanase has great potential as catalyst of degrading lignocellulose. However, the practical application of xylanase in the industrial sector is limited by its instability, high production cost and difficulties of recycling. In this study, three-dimensional (3D) printing technology was used to immobilize xylanase. The optimum immobilization conditions were determined by single-factor experiments and response surface methods: sodium alginate (SA) concentration was 1 wt%, the CaCl2 concentration was 2 wt%, the crosslinking time was 10 min, and the reaction temperature was 52celcius. As a biocompatible adhesive, calcium alginate (CA) can be easily printed. The structural programmability of 3D printing technology endowed the immobilized xylanase with sphere, hook, quadrangle and hexagon shapes. The immobilized xylanase exhibited the excellent reusability with recovered 60% enzyme activity after 7 times using compared with free xylanase. Moreover, the ability of 3D printed xylanase to degrade lignocellulose of corn cob at the large-scale indicated the great potential in the application of industrial production, which can provide a certain reference for the biological intelligent manufacturing of high value-added chemicals.

AB Plastic is probably the fraction of the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) most challenging to manage and the market of recycled plastics from WEEE is limited to few cases. In this study, twenty WEEE plastic samples collected in two material recovery facilities (MRFs) from manually sorted housings and components and among some discarded devices stored in Casaccia Research Center were analysed through infrared identification and chemical-physical characterization. The analyses were carried out in order to select the suitable samples for mechanical recycling in 3D printer filaments. Eleven different polymers or blends were found in the WEEE samples and the majority of those collected in the MRFs resulted as mixtures of different plastics, although often of styrene-based nature. On the other hand, many WEEE samples showed a good similarity to the corresponding virgin polymers with a content of halogens and inorganic fillers less than 0.2 and 5 wt%, respectively. The thirteen selected WEEE plastic samples were washed, reduced to < 4 mm and extruded in filaments with the proper diameter. The polymeric heterogeneity and the presence of foreign materials in some samples were the main critical issues highlighted during the extrusion. The suitable filaments were used to print test objects with different geometries. The quality control of the scanned objects, through a structured-light 3D scanner, showed that specimens printed with WEEE plastic filaments had no significant higher deviation from the model design in comparison to the same object produced using the commercial filaments.

AB Plastic waste is a global environmental issue, while natural resources, such as sand, is limited and are depleting as opposed to the abundance of waste plastics. This study investigates the suitability of adding recycled plastic waste, in the form of Resin8, for the first time, into 3D printed concrete (3DPC) as fine aggregate replacement. Replacement values of 5 %, 10 % and 15 % of natural sand by volume are investigated, which are further characterised by varying Resin8 particle sizes. Particle sizes of Resin8 included are sub-5 mm, sub-1 mm and a combination of the two at equal proportions (50/50). The Resin8 replacement mixes are tested against the standard 'reference' 3DPC mix of Stellenbosch University. A total of ten mixes were formulated, which were 3D printed and cast, to investigate the effect of Resin8 on the printed samples process. The fresh and hardened properties of each mix were investigated, which included slump flow, rheological characterisation, density and air content, buildability, and flexural and compressive strength in two orientations due to the anisotropic nature of 3DPC. Further, the microstructure of samples was investigated using micro-computed tomography and scanning electron microscopy analyses. The addition of Resin8 led to more flowable mixes with less thixotropic behaviour, which decreased the buildability performance. The flexural and compressive strength decreased as the amount of Resin8 increased, while an improved interlayer bond strength was found with the addition of Resin8. An overall performance loss was found by adding Resin8 into 3DPC mixes. However, replacing a portion of fine aggregates in 3D printable concrete with Resin8 is a viable solution that can effectively reduce plastic waste in our environment. Even small amounts of Resin8 replacement can make a significant impact, considering concrete is the most widely used construction material.

AB This study aims to develop 3D printing filament composites that support sustainability and waste reduction goals by utilizing wood waste and recycled polypropylene. This study evaluated the effect of Maleic Anhydride Polyethylene (MAPE) and Maleic Anhydride Polypropylene (MAPP) compatibilizers on the mechanical properties of the filament. The study found that r-WoPPc filament with MAPP and MAPE had higher tensile strength compared to r-WoPPc with significant increments of 13% and 74%, respectively, compared to v-WoPPc. The flexural strength of r-WoPPc increased by 18% and 60% after adding optimum loading MAPP and MAPE, respectively. The finding also reveals a significant enhancement in the tensile and flexural strength of the composite, proportional to the increase in MAPP percentage. In contrast, as the MAPE content increases, the tensile strength and flexural strength of the r-WoPPc experience a gradual decrease. Consequently, the addition of MAPP and MAPE improved the interfacial adhesion between wood and polypropylene, as revealed by the surface morphology of the r-WoPPc tensile fractured surface. Moreover, the reduced water absorption in r-WoPPc is attributed to the enhanced interfacial adhesion between wood fibers and the r-PP matrix, associated with improved tensile and flexural strength. The highest tensile strength of r-WoPPc with MAPP absorbs 14% water, while the lowest tensile strength absorbs 26%. Likewise, the highest tensile strength of r-WoPPc with MAPE absorbs only 0.8% water, compared to the lowest strength, which absorbs 2% water. This study demonstrated the potential for producing 3D printing filament from recycled polypropylene and wood waste, which benefits sustainability.

AB 3D printing is quickly becoming a major manufacturing process in recent years, with fused deposition modelling (FDM) being the most popular method. The use of thermoplastic waste as feedstock for FDM could reduce environmental pollution as well as increase the versatility of this technique. Polystyrene (PS) foam is one of the few thennoplastics that is completely recyclable but is not commonly recycled due to high transportation costs. In this research, waste PS foam was recycled into FDM filament. Filament of roughly 1.75 mm in diameter was extruded with a desktop filament extruder. Rheological analysis was conducted on the filament whereas tensile test and morphological analysis was done on the 3D printed parts. The measured properties of the recycled PS (rPS) filament and prints were then compared with those of commercial high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). rPS specimens had about a 45% higher tensile strength than HIPS specimens. The stifthess of rPS specimens was approximately 52% greater than HIPS specimens. However, rPS specimens were substantially more brittle, with only a 1% elongation at break as compared the 7.5% of HIPS specimens. Observation of the print surfaces of the tensile specimens under a compound microscope showed that unlike HIPS specimens, rPS specimens contained small quantities of impurities and air bubbles, which led to larger standard deviations in tensile properties. Rheological analysis had revealed that rPS filament melt had lower viscosities than HIPS. Overall, some of the mechanical properties of rPS are comparable to commercial HIPS, making it a viable feedstock for FDM.

AB Plastic pollution, driven by the overuse of plastics and inadequate waste management, poses severe environmental and health risks. Despite the potential benefits of recycling, rates remain low due to the high costs of centralized recycling systems and the associated greenhouse gas emissions. Motivated by this challenge, this study explores the reuse of plastic waste for 3D printing as a viable and sustainable alternative. A Brabender melt mixer was used to combine discarded plastic bags and high-density polyethylene. The resulting composite was processed into 3D printing filaments using a single-screw extruder. Dumbbell-shaped specimens were then created by melt extrusion following ASTM D412 specifications. Mechanical properties were tested using a Universal Testing Machine, and morphological features were examined via Scanning Electron Microscopy. The goal is to reduce plastic pollution and encourage innovative recycling practices. Our approach integrates 3D printing with Finite Element Analysis to accelerate product development and minimize material waste, enabling rapid prototyping and design optimization. Optimized prototypes were fabricated through 3D printing for efficient material use. A 5 wt% waste plastic blend demonstrated superior tensile strength and thermal stability compared to pure HDPE. This blend was successfully used to design a bike fairing, validated through AutoCAD and Finite Element Simulation.

AB Recycling metallic powders used in the additive manufacturing (AM) process is essential for reducing the process cost, manufacturing time, energy consumption, and metallic waste. In this paper, the focus is on pore formation in recycled powder particles of stainless steel 316L during the selective laser melting process. We have introduced the concept of optimizing the powder bed's printing area in order to see the extent of the affected powders during the 3D-printing process. X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) is used to characterize the pores inside the particles. The results from image processing of the tomography (rendered in 3D format) indicate a broader pore size distribution and a higher pore density in recycled powders compared to their virgin counterparts. To elucidate on this, the Electron Dispersion spectroscopy (EDX) analysis and Synchrotron-based Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES) were performed to reveal the chemical composition distribution across the pore area and bulk of the recycled powder particles. Higher concentrations of Fe, Cr, and Ni were recorded on the interior wall of the pore in recycled particles and higher Mn, S and Si concentrations were recorded in the outer layer around the pore area and on the surface of the recycled particle. The pore formation in recycled powder is attributed to out-diffusion of Mn, S and Si to the outer surface as a result of the incident laser heat during the AM process due to higher electron affinity of such metallic elements to oxygenation. HAXPES analysis shows a higher MnO concentration around the pore area which impedes the in-diffusion of other elements into the bulk and thereby helps to creates a void. The inside wall of the pore area (dendrites), has a higher concentration of Fe and Cr oxide. We believe the higher pore density in recycled powders is due, at least in part to composition redistribution, promoted by laser heat during the AM process. Nanoindentation analyses on both virgin and recycled powder particles shows a lower hardness and higher effective modulus in the recycled powder particles attributed to the higher porosity in recycled powders.

AB Supporting various applications of digital fabrication and manufacturing, the industrial robot is typically assigned repetitive tasks for specific pre-programmed and singular applications. We propose a novel approach for robotic fabrication and manufacturing entitled Compound Fabrication, supporting multi-functional and multi-material processes. This approach combines the major manufacturing technologies including additive, formative and subtractive fabrication, as well as their parallel integration. A 6-axis robotic arm, repurposed as an integrated 3D printing, milling and sculpting platform, enables shifting between fabrication modes and across scales using different end effectors. Promoting an integrated approach to robotic fabrication, novel combination processes are demonstrated including 3D printing and milling fabrication composites. In addition, novel robotic fabrication processes are developed and evaluated, such as multi-axis plastic 3D printing, direct recycling 3D printing, and embedded printing. The benefits and limitations of the Compound Fabrication approach and its experimental platform are reviewed and discussed. Finally, contemplation regarding the future of multi-functional robotic fabrication is offered, in the context of the experiments reviewed and demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB Established light-based additive manufacturing (AM) processes, such as vat polymerization, utilize nonrecyclable thermoset polymers, posing sustainability concerns. This work presents a method for circular photopolymerization three-dimensional (3D) printing of thermoplastic parts, addressing the demand for low-waste production of complex, high-resolution polymer parts. This is achieved through interfacial photopolymerization (IPP), where linear polymer chains form layerwise into entangled networks at the interface between the immiscible organic and aqueous phases. IPP has previously been demonstrated, but with limited chemistries and without 3D structural control. We demonstrate herein a chemistry to form poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) by IPP and a process for multilayer fabrication in a modified commercial projector-based 3D printer. Layer resolution and stability are enhanced using light-absorbing dye and a water-soluble polyethylene glycol (PEG) binder. Postprocessing with controlled air drying and thermal treatment with PEG infiltration preserves geometry and reduces cracking. The resulting composite comprises 75% PEG and 25% PMMA with mechanical properties akin to those of polymer foams. Circularity of the IPP-PMMA process is demonstrated by recycling and reincorporating printed objects across several cycles without significant degradation of properties. Although enhancements in geometric fidelity and mechanical properties are necessary, IPP 3D printing enables, for the first time, digital light processing of recyclable thermoplastic PMMA and PEG-based parts.

DE TiAl7Nb7 Titanium Alloy; HDH Process; 3D Metal Printing
AB Titanium alloys are considered advanced and high-value materials due to their special properties and high production cost. Titanium alloys are often used in the aerospace, automotive and medical industries, due to their high strength/weight ratio, corrosion resistance, biocompatibility and low thermal expansion characteristics. In addition to structural efficiency, titanium alloys are characterized by high corrosion resistance and do not cause chemical or immunological reactions in the human body. The production of titanium is very expensive, so it is important to research technologies that require lower costs. One of these is the HDH process, which is used for the cheaper production of powder from waste material of titanium alloys. This paper presents the quality of the powder obtained by recycling a piece of TiAl6Nb7 titanium alloy, which can then be used as a raw material for 3D metal printing, which is recent and not yet commonly used.

AB In this paper, Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene matrix composites reinforced with Nano-silica dioxide particles were examined and prepared to study their mechanical properties. The composite sheets were pre-prepared using the hot extrusion process. Due to its wide characteristics, silica dioxide additions can strengthen the usability and mechanical features of composite thermoplastics and polymers. Furthermore, introducing silica dioxide as a filler in various attributes can help to maintain the smooth flow of sufficient powders, reduce caking, and manage viscoelasticity. Despite its advantages, 3D printing generates a significant amount of waste due to limited prints or destroyed support structures. ABS is an ideal material to use because it is a thermoplastic and amorphous polymer with outstanding thermal properties that is also applicable with the FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) technique. The findings showed that increasing the silica dioxide content reduces the tensile strength to 22.4 MPa at 10 wt%. Toughness, ductility, and yield stress values of ABS/silica dioxide composites at 15 wt% increased, indicating that the composite material reinforced by the silica dioxide particles improved material characteristics. It is essential to consider the impact of recycling in polymer reinforcement with fillers. Furthermore, the improved mechanical qualities of the composite material encourages successful ABS recycling from 3D printing, as well as the possibility of reusing it in a similar application.

AB Industrialization harms the quality of water; therefore, cleaning and monitoring water sources are essential for sustainable human health and aquatic life. An increase in active surface area and porosity can result in quick and efficient cleaning activity. 3D printing can build porous architecture with controlled porosity and active surface area. Here, catalytically active ZnO nanosheets were grown on the surface of 3D printed architecture (Schwarzites and Weissmuller) with different porosity and surface area. The Weissmuller structure along with ZnO, has shown better catalytic performance due to its higher porosity (-69%) and high active surface area, compared to Schwarzites structure. Synergistic effect of adsorption and photodegradation has resulted in -95% removal efficiency of mixed dye within 10 min by Weissmuller structure. The dye degradation efficiency was determined using colorimetric measurements with a regular smartphone for real-time quantitative investigation of dye removal efficiency. Most importantly, decorated 3D printed structures exhibit high structural stability without residuals (ZnO nanosheets) in water after performing the recycling experiment. Therefore, the decorated 3D printing structures and colorimetric detection method will offer a user-friendly versatile technique for analysis of removal efficiency of toxic components in different polluted water sources without using high-end sophisticated instruments and complicated procedures.

SO JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C

ID UP-CONVERSION NANOPARTICLES; NIR-LIGHT; POLYMERIZATION
AB The efficiency of near-infrared (NIR) light-induced photopolymerization depends considerably on its photodynamics, which is affected by photoinitiated systems and, inevitably, the thermal effect of NIR light. This study reports the underlying photothermal synergy mechanism of NIR light-induced up-conversion material-assisted photopolymerization (UCAP) employing extra thermal initiation for utilizing undeveloped heat to improve NIR photopolymerization and 3D printing efficiency. The results revealed that excited up-conversion particles (UCPs) not only provide upconverted photon energy but also release heat to aggravate the thermal effect after NIR irradiation. The designed photothermal synergetic curing (PTSC) systems recycle unavailable heat to reduce the necessary energy threshold of the UCAP process by 35% and accelerate NIR photopolymerization for rapid 3D printing of complex structures with 40% enhanced mechanical properties. Moreover, oxygen inhibition is alleviated to improve the surface sharpness of printing materials due to the utilization enhancement of NIR light energy to increase, particularly, the overall surface conversion. The established photothermal synergy mechanism in UCAP provides a theoretical foundation for efficiently fabricating various unsupported and sharp-surface materials, highlighting the potential applications of UCAP technology in high-precision material manufacturing.

ID WASTE
AB Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy-metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain approximate to 80%) and conductivity (approximate to 2.1 x 10(4) S m(-1)). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.

AB Strategies for synthesis and processing of silicone rubber materials in three-dimensional (3D) structures are of significant interest based on their exceptional potential in many applications including flexible electronics and biomedical devices. Here, we present a synthetic approach of crosslinked polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) exhibiting dynamic siloxane bond exchange for sufficient stress relaxation capability to enable versatile processabilities including reprocessing, remolding, self-healing, and hot-melt extrusion 3D printing. Considering the significant potential of recyclable silicone materials and their 3D structures, presented approaches enabled by dynamic exchangeable PDMS can provide a new pathway to replace conventional unrecyclable silicone used in diverse industrial sectors.

AB Acrylic photopolymer resins are widely used in stereolithographic3D printing. However, the growing demand for such thermosetting resinsis weighing on global issues such as waste management and fossil fuelconsumption. Therefore, there is an increasing demand for reactivecomponents that are biobased and enable recyclability of the resultingthermoset products. In this work, the synthesis of a photo-cross-linkablemolecule containing dynamic imine bonds based on biobased vanillinand dimer fatty diamine is described. Using the biobased buildingblocks, formulations containing reactive diluent and a photoinitiatorwere prepared. The mixtures could be rapidly cross-linked under UVlight, yielding vitrimers. Using digital light processing, 3D-printedparts were prepared, which were rigid, thermally stable, and reprocessedwithin 5 min at elevated temperature and pressure. The addition ofa building block containing a higher concentration of imine bondsaccelerated the stress relaxation and improved the mechanical rigidityof the vitrimers. This work will contribute to the development ofbiobased and recyclable 3D-printed resins to facilitate the transitionto a circular economy.

AB In this research, an investigation related to the tensile testing of 3D-printed specimens, under different fabrication parameters, is presented. The control samples were fabricated using Recycled-PETG: EVO (NEEMA3D (TM), Athens, Greece). It consists of recycled polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) raw material, already used in industry, modified so that it becomes filament and can be printed again. More specifically, the parameters set to be studied are the percentage of infill, the speed and the type of infill. Both infill density and printing speed have three value levels, whereas for the infill pattern, two types were selected. Two sets of 18 specimens each were fabricated, with respect to the different parameter combinations. Through the results of the tests, the maximum tension of each specimen was obtained separately. Of the three parameters defined, it was found that the most important are the type of infill (44.77%) and the percentage of infill (24.67%). Speed (13.22%) did not strongly affect the strength of the specimens. In conclusion, the empirical model developed was considered reliable in terms of the value of the squared error, R-sq(pred) (97.72%), but also of the rest of the resulting analysis residual graphs (through the full factorial design).

AB High volumetric shrinkage and rheological behavior of polypropylene (PP) are the main problems that make material extrusion (MEX) uncommon for this material. The complexity is raised when recycled materials are used. This research covered different aspects of the MEX process of virgin and recycled PP, from the analysis of rough materials to the mechanical evaluation of the final products. Two types of virgin PP (one in pellet and the other in filament form) and one recycled PP were analyzed. Thermal characterization and rheological analysis of these materials were initially employed to understand the peculiar properties of all investigated PP and set filament extrusion. The 3D parts were then printed using processed filaments to check fabrication quality through visual analysis and mechanical tests. A well-structured approach was proposed to encompass the limitations of PP 3D printing by accurately evaluating the influence of the material properties on the final part performance. The results revealed that the dimensional and mechanical performances of the recycled PP were comparable with the virgin filament commonly employed in MEX, making it particularly suitable for this application.

AB In recent years, plastic dependency has become a significant issue, where almost 90% of all households contain plastic products. Plastic waste accumulates because of its non-biodegradable nature, posing a threat to the ecosystem. This article investigates the indigenous process of converting polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle waste into filament using a 1.75 mm nozzle extruder for 3D printing. PET bottles were collected, heated, cleaned, cut into strips, and fed into a custom-made extrusion machine to form a filament while maintaining a constant diameter at the end of the extruder. The study also evaluates the process parameters of fused deposition modeling (FDM), including extrusion speed, nozzle temperature, and plastic waste preparation. Mechanical performance of the recycled PET filament was thoroughly assessed via tensile and compression tests, hardness measurements, surface roughness analysis, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of fractured and as-printed samples. Results indicate the recycled PET filament exhibited approximately half the tensile strength compared to commercial or virgin PET filament, highlighting its inherent brittleness and limitations in interlayer adhesion. Conversely, the compressive strength was superior by approximately 30 MPa, and hardness values also exceeded those of recycled PET filament. SEM analysis of 3D-printed PET under tensile testing reveals brittle fracture characteristics, weak interlayer adhesion, void coalescence, and microcracks, indicating inhomogeneities and incomplete layer fusion as primary failure contributors. This approach aims to reduce plastic waste by recycling it into functional products and providing a sustainable solution.

AB The large volume of industrial by-products and wastes from the construction, timber and paper industries has become a serious challenge worldwide. Recycling these industrial wastes as functional materials in the construction industry is an efficient approach for sustainable development. This study presents a pretreatment approach for recycling construction and demolition waste (CDW) and industrial side-streams (such as green liquor sludge, fiber waste, flotation sand and fly ash) in order to produce a geopolymer for the 3D printing of construction materials. A treatment approach was developed for screening the residues from CDW with a maximum size of 16 mm and for a combined line treatment for industrial side streams. The treatment processes utilized suitable and economical separation techniques for the recycling of waste materials. The crushing of the screened residues resulted in a homogeneous material size that facilitates the separation of mixed wastes and simplifies the classification of materials. The combined plant enabled the cost-effective treatment of various industrial wastes in a single process unit. The results show that the economic and environmental impact of the chosen techniques, in terms of their energy consumption, is highly dependent on the treatment line, separation technique and quantity of the individual waste that is processed. These recycled industrial wastes can be used as sustainable materials for the production of geopolymer concrete, contributing to the sustainability of the construction industry.

AB Extensive use and disposal of waste plastic bags have caused significant environmental issues. However, waste plastic bags can be used as fibers to enforce the mechanical properties of cementitious materials. Therefore, the effect of waste plastic fibers on the printability and mechanical properties of 3D-printed cement mortar was investigated in this work. The experiment mainly studied how the parameters of waste-plastic-fiber contents, fiber widths, and printing spacing affected the flowability, buildability, compressive strength, and flexural strength of 3D-printed cement mortar. Additionally, the microstructure of the printed specimens was analyzed by X-ray computed tomography (CT) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results showed that the addition of waste plastic fibers improved the flexural strength of 3D-printed mortar to a certain extent, with the maximum value achieved at the fiber content of 0.3%, for the same fiber width and printing spacing. However, as the fiber content increased, the X-CT scan showed that the porosity of the cement mortar gradually increased, resulting in a decrease in its compressive strength. Varying fiber widths had little effect on the mechanical properties of the printed specimens, whereas the spacing between the printing filaments had a significant influence on it. Larger printing spacing lowered the bonding performance between the printing filaments, thereby weakening the mechanical properties of the cement mortar. SEM images revealed that more pores were generated in the printed mortar than in the cast, resulting in the compressive strength of the cast higher than that of the printed. However, the extrusion of the mortar through the nozzle during printing improved the bond strength between the filaments, so the flexural strength of the printed specimens was significantly higher than that of the cast. This study may provide knowledge on recycling waste plastic bags as building materials to alleviate environmental pollution and also reserve resources.

AB Protection, restoration, and regeneration of aquatic habitats are an increasingly important issue and are requiring intensive research. In the marine environment, artificial reefs may be deployed to help offset habitat loss, increase local biodiversity and stimulate the recovery of ecosystems. This study aimed at the fabrication of artificial reefs by 3D printing. In the framework of the European INTERREG Atlantic Area collaborative project "3DPARE", six printed concrete formulations with limited environmental impact, based on geopolymer or cement CEM III binders and recycled sands, were immersed in the Atlantic along British, French, Portuguese and Spanish coasts. The colonisation of the concrete samples by micro- and macroorganisms and their durability were assessed after 1, 3 and 6 months of immersion. Results showed that both parameters were better with CEM III compared to geopolymer-based formulations. Therefore the use of CEM III should be prioritised over these geopolymer binders in 3D printed concrete for artificial reef applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB With the advantages of reducing cost, time-saving, and lower labour requirements, 3D concrete printing is an emerging technology in global construction applications. It can be regarded as a sustainable construction approach of concrete. However, conventional printable cementitious materials contain considerable amounts of Portland cement for "guarantee" performance reasons, increasing the materials' cost and environmental impact. On the other side, it is a great challenge to handle the significant amount of construction and demolition (C&D) materials generated per year from local construction activities including in Hong Kong. The utilization of waste concrete as recycled aggregate (RA) is an effective approach to save natural resources, protect the environment and realise the sustainable development of the construction industry. Therefore, this current study pursued 3D printable low-carbon concrete printing approach by substituting 30% silica sand with RA. The RA was treated by soaking in 5% nano-silica slurry for 18 h and air-drying at a temperature of 28 +/- 2 degrees C and relative humidity of 85 +/- 5% for at least 7 days. It is revealed that the concrete with nano-silica treated RA has acceptable rheological properties and printability. Results can be concluded that 3D printable low-carbon concrete with good extrudability and acceptable buildability can be prepared by using nano-silica pretreated RA.

AB A mix design, using a mixture of sand and mine tailings as aggregates, was selected to produce a cement-based 3D printing material suitable for building purposes. Different dosage rates of mine tailings, water, superplasticizers, and accelerators were added to the mixture with the end of looking for the optimum strength, workability and buildability. The term buildability includes aspects such as pumpability and printability. Different tests were carried out in order to compare homogeneous material strength with printed material strength, to evaluate the bonding strength between filaments, and to establish the relationship between fresh behaviour and buildability for printing applications. Finally, a mixture with 20% of recycled materials demonstrated its ability to be used as concrete printing material in the construction industry in the frame of circular economy concept.

AB Within the complex framework of additive manufacturing, direct ink writing (DIW) processes significantly contribute to extending the range of 3D-printable materials (i.e., thermosetting resins, ceramics, hydrogels). Thanks to this technology, viscous inks are easily extruded for the creation of 3D structures. Nevertheless, the quick recovery of the solid-like behavior after extrusion remains one of the most crucial open issues for 3D-printable inks. The main goal herein is to improve the printability of a UV-curable thermosetting composite ink reinforced with mechanically recycled glass fiber composites by modifying its rheological behavior. The overall process is optimized, leading to the definition of the optimal extrusion parameters for these types of materials. Furthermore, the retraction mode is successfully developed for the DIW of recycled composites. Additional features are achieved, thanks to the aforementioned improvements, such as 3D complex shapes, assembled pieces, and/or moving built-in mechanisms, increasing the number of new potential applications of recycled glass fiber-reinforced polymers.

ID RADICAL POLYMERIZATION; POLYMERS
AB Achieving a circular plastics economy is one of our greatest environmental challenges, yet conventional mechanical recycling remains inadequate for thermoplastics and incompatible with thermosets. The next generation of plastic materials will be designed with the capacity for degradation and recycling at end-of-use. To address this opportunity in the burgeoning technologies of 3D printing and photolithography, we report a modular system for the production of degradable and recyclable thermosets via photopolymerization. The polyurethane backbone imparts robust, elastic, and tunable mechanical properties, while the use of hemiacetal ester linkages allows for facile degradation under mild acid. The synthetic design based on hemiacetal esters enables simple purification to regenerate a functional polyurethane diol.

SO RSC SUSTAINABILITY

ID SUBSTRATE RELEASE MECHANISMS; LITHIUM; RESINS
AB With the increasing adoption of solar energy, the disposal of end-of-life photovoltaic modules has become a growing environmental concern. As crystalline silicon has significant potential as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries, this study investigates recycling waste solar cell material into batteries using 3D printing. An open-source toolchain is developed to ensure accessible replication including a ball mill for grinding the waste silicon, a bottle roller for synthesizing novel stereolithography (SLA) resins and an SLA 3D printer for geometric control of the deposition of the materials. The materials were characterized at each step using spectrometry analysis, differential thermal analysis and thermogravimetric analysis of the polymer resin, optical microscopy on the printed parts, as well as scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction on the pyrolyzed parts. Electrochemical characterization, including cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge-discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, was performed on the assembled batteries. A mixture of 12% ground silicon solar cells with SLA resin was used for 3D printing the anodes and the samples were pyrolyzed at 1400 degrees C. The electrochemical tests from the anodes demonstrated a specific capacity of around 400 mA h g-1 with 89% capacity retention and coulombic efficiency more than 100% over 200 cycles. This study presents a promising sustainable solution by integrating recycled solar cell waste into lithium-ion battery anode production, which can address both waste management and energy storage challenges.

AB This study investigates the effect of annealing on the mechanical properties of fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D-printed recycled carbon fiber (rCF)-reinforced composites. In this study, filaments for FDM 3D printers are self-fabricated from pure acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and ABS reinforced with fiber content of 10 wt% and 20 wt% rCF. This study explores the tensile and flexural properties as a function of the annealing temperature and time for the three different fiber content values. In addition, dimensional measurements of the shape changes are performed to determine the suitability of applying annealing in practical manufacturing processes. The results show that annealing improves the mechanical properties by narrowing the voids between the beads, which occur during the FDM process, and by reducing the gaps between the fibers and polymer. Following annealing, the largest tensile and flexural strength improvements are 12.64% and 42.33%, respectively, for the 20 wt% rCF content samples. Moreover, compared with the pure ABS samples, the annealing effect improves the mechanical properties of the rCF-reinforced samples more effectively, and they have higher dimensional stability, indicating their suitability for annealing. These results are expected to expand the application fields of rCF and greatly increase the potential use of FDM-printed parts.

AB We characterized the surface and microstructure of both feedstock (virgin) and recycled Stainless Steel 316L powders used for selective laser melting process. Reusing the recycled powders can significantly reduce the powder consumption, production cost and time. We have performed X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and rheology analysis on steel powders both on the virgin powder and the powders not adhered to the printed parts but recycled in the powder bed. The results confirm that the oxygen level on the surface of the recycled powder is increasing and the metallic oxides diffuse out to the surface of the powder particles during the manufacturing process. Nevertheless, the changes are not significant which promise the reusability of the recycled powders for several cycles. We observed no change on the phase of the recycled powder. Further characterizations are ongoing to measure the chemical composition and morphology of both virgin and recycled powders to correlate them with the mechanical properties of the printed parts. These characterizations allow extending the powder reuse for a number of reusing cycles and reducing the manufacturing time and cost without reducing the mechanical properties of the final parts.

AB PurposeTo explore the influence of various factors on the adhesion strength of 3D printing materials and chiffon fabrics, and to develop an original design clothing prototype with an extended functionality that would be compatible with the specifics of the circular design.Design/methodology/approachFour different chiffon fabrics and four 3D printed materials were chosen as the research subjects to determine the influence of various factors on the adhesion strength and ductility. The uniaxial tensile test was used to determine pull-out force and the pull-out elongation from the interlayer.Findings3D printed TPU elements can be used to join clothing parts made from low-elasticity chiffon fabrics to improve wearing comfort. In order to comply with the circular economy concept, it is important to select such adhesion parameters of the 3D printed elements and the material system that would ensure wear comfort and withstand wear-level loads; and at the end of the life cycle of a garment, the 3D printed elements could be separated from the product and recycled.Originality/valueThe systems developed can be used to renew and repair products, adding originality, individual touch or additional decorative features, while extending the functional possibilities of clothing items in accordance with circular design principles.

AB Additive manufacturing technologies have achieved great development in last decade on area of technology and printing materials. Special emphasis is placed on the development of materials that would be cheaper, from natural sources, without releases of harmful substances during the manufacturing process and usage, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are one of the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combination with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood-plastic composites will also expand to the area of structural elements, for example, in the construction of prefabricated houses. The fire behaviour of 3D printed wood/PLA specimens was determined according to ASTM E 2058 standard and microscale combustion calorimetry (MCC) with ASTM 7309-13.

AB Recycled Ultrafine Glass Powder (UFGP) is used to create Reactive Powder Concrete (RPC), a construction material with outstanding qualities for 3D printed concrete (3DPC) applications. Due to its pozzolanic characteristics and particle size, UFGP increases the strength of concrete. By partially replacing cement, using UFGP in 3DPC might reduce waste from the glass industry, advance sustainability, and make it possible to build durable, environmentally friendly, and reasonably priced structures. This study investigates the impact of incorporating 10 mu m UFGP as a cement replacement, at rates ranging from 0% to 25%, on the fresh performance, constructability, and mechanical properties of 3DP-RPC. Results showed an increase of slump by 27.54% with 25% UFGP. Mix with 20% UFGP showed a comparable compressive and flexural strength with the control sample. Therefore, incorporating GP in concrete not only enhances its properties but also significantly reduces its carbon footprint. This innovative approach has considerable potential in promoting environmental sustainability in the construction industry.

AB Vitrimerization is one of the new methods under development to convert polymer wastes into high-value compounds. The chemistry of vitrimers is such that the presence of dynamic chemical bonds changes the permanent covalent bonds into covalent adaptable networks, which are reversible. This allows for recycling and reprocessing of polymers by maintaining their initial properties after several cycles, which is included in the preparation of polymer resins to convert polymer waste into materials that can be formulated for three-dimensional (3D) printing resins. Four-dimensional (4D) printing has also been recently introduced as sustain-able 3D printing of responsive polymers with dynamic applications, such as soft robotics, medicine, and medicals. Therefore, the synthesis of polymers with dynamic chemistry based on vitrimers can add unique properties such as shape memory, shape recovery, self-healing, and flexibility to the 3D printed products. Vitrimerization chemistry could contribute to polymer waste by producing 4D-printed resins. This article presents the vitrimerization chemistry used in different polymers to produce 4D printing resins with the mentioned capabilities and lists their recipes for the preparation of formulations used in 4D printing so that the researchers can use them in a practical way to possibly achieve simultaneous shape-programmable, self-healing, and recyclable features in printed structures.

AB Additive manufacturing has recently become popular and more cost-effective for building construction. This study presents a prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) of 3D-printed foamed geopolymer composites (3D-FOAM materials) incorporating construction and demolition waste. The materials were developed using fly ash, slag, sand, and a foaming agent, with recycled clay brick waste (CBW) and autoclaved aerated concrete waste (AACW) added as alternative raw materials. The material formulations were evaluated for their compressive strength and thermal conductivity to define two functional units that reflect structural and thermal performance. A prospective life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted under laboratory-scale conditions using the ReCiPe 2016 method. Results show that adding CBW and AACW reduces environmental impacts across several categories, including global warming potential and ecotoxicity, without compromising material performance. Compared to conventional wall systems, the 3D-FOAM materials offer a viable low-impact alternative when assessed on a functional basis. These findings highlight the potential of integrating recycled materials into additive manufacturing to support circular economy goals in the construction sector.

AB In recent years, three-dimensional (3D) printing has emerged as an outstanding technique for creating intricate 3D structures with complex geometries. Additionally, four-dimensional (4D) printing technology has attracted attention due to its ability to reshape of 3D printed structures under external stimuli overtime. The application of this technique in various fields such as polymer recycling, coating, energy storage systems, medical tools, and hydrogels is due to recent advances in functional materials. Vat photopolymerization-based 3D (VP-based 3D) printing relies on photopolymerization reactions, which are commonly used in techniques such as digital light processing (DLP) and stereolithography (SLA). These techniques are associated with critical parameters such as curing kinetics, printing speed, and resolution. Photoinitiators (PIs) as one of the components of the formulation of photo-resins and photo-inks can be very effective in optimizing these parameters. There are challenges in using common photoinitiators, such as yellowing effect, migration to the surface, toxicity, and bio-incompatibility. To address these challenges, recent researches have been directed towards the synthesis of new photoinitiators based on bio-inspired compounds, inorganic particles, aliphatic structures, transition metals, fluorescent compounds, photo-sensitizers, and macro-structure-based photoinitiators. This review article aims to explore recent studies on the synthesis of new photoinitiators in the application of 3D and 4D printing. Also, it examines various chemistries in the design of photoinitiators and describes the relationship between the curing kinetic, type of monomers, and printing speed. Moreover, it highlights the potential of synthesized photoinitiators in addressing challenges with mechanical properties, resolution, and transparency of the printed part. Furthermore, this article effectively categorizes various types of photoinitiators based on organic and inorganic compounds. Finally, the article aims to generate interest and stimulate more research in the use of new photoinitiators in industrial applications and formulation towards sustainable 3D and 4D printed structures.

AB N-doped porous carbon material has exhibited unique adsorption properties. However, it remains as a challenge to recycle the carbon adsorbent. In this work, a monolithic N-doped carbon material was manufactured via the direct ink writing, a conventional 3D printing technology. Melamine was used as source of nitrogen. It was added to the starch gelatin system to form the ink. The SiO2 microsphere was used as the template agent, which was dispersed in the ink. After the printing, the template was removed by washing with NaOH solution. The size of the SiO2 microsphere determines the pore size of the printed carbon monolithic adsorbent, which shows a high rate of removal of methylene blue, as an illustration. The printed adsorbent can be easily separated from the solution for the recyclable applications. The 3D printing strategy provides us a more convenient method to fabricate structured N-doped porous carbon materials beyond the adsorption of methylene blue.

AB Photopolymerization 3D printing technology is an efficient and precise advanced manufacturing method. However, most current photopolymerization precursors achieve rapid conversion from liquid to solid through multifunctional monomers, which often results in the production of large amounts of non-recyclable thermosetting materials, thereby exacerbating resource waste and environmental pollution. Therefore, this work employed a solvent-free method to synthesize a novel polyurethane acrylate (PUB) prepolymer containing hindered urea bonds (HUB), achieving recyclability and shape memory functionality in the 3D printed materials (PUB/IBOA). In the PUB/IBOA materials, the hindered urea bond was dynamically dissociated at 90 degrees C, rapidly destroying the original crosslinking network. The dissociated -NCO reacted with the -NH group in tert-butylamine ethyl methacrylate (TBEMA) to regenerate the PUB monomer, which then participated in photocuring 3D printing, realizing the recycling of 3D printed materials. Additionally, by adjusting the molecular weight of the prepolymer, the mechanical properties of the PUB/IBOA material can be effectively regulated to suit a wider range of application scenarios.

AB The concrete 3D printing sector can advance sustainable development by formulating environmentally-friendly materials incorporating waste as supplementary cementitious materials. Addressing the high cement content in printed materials is crucial for the sustainability of this rapidly evolving technology in concrete digital fabrication. This article comprehensively explores utilizing waste materials in 3D-printing concrete. This literature review encompasses discussions on various waste materials to formulate 3D printable compositions. It explores the chemical properties and microstructure of these raw materials and their impact on the rheological and mechanical properties of the resulting mixtures. Additionally, the literature review includes discussions on X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses, focusing on their applications in examining the microstructure. Environmental sustainability aspects related to these materials are also reviewed and discussed. This review offers a novel perspective on using waste materials in 3D printing, which is not extensively covered in existing literature. The incorporation of various waste materials significantly impacts the construction process of 3D- printing by altering key properties, including rheological and mechanical properties. These properties varied depending on the type of waste material used. The study demonstrates that the compressive strength of 3D-printed concrete is significantly influenced by the type of waste materials incorporated and the orientation of the printed specimens. Including waste in 3D-printing concrete reduces carbon emissions and energy consumption compared to using pure ordinary Portland cement mixtures. The review paper is significant as it highlights the potential for waste materials in 3D-printed concrete to promote environmental sustainability by reducing cement usage, improving mechanical properties, and decreasing carbon emissions and energy consumption, while offering a comprehensive analysis of the chemical and microstructural effects of these materials.

ID BEHAVIOR
AB This paper explores the new potential strategy of using fine recycled aggregates (fRA) derived from waste 3D printed concrete (3DPC) as a substitute for cement in additive manufacturing. This study hypothesizes that fRA can optimize mixture design, reduce cement content, and contribute to sustainable construction practices. Experimental programs were conducted to evaluate the fresh and hardened properties, printability window, and buildability of 3DPC mixes containing fRA. Mixes with replacement rates of cement with fRA by 10 vol%, 20 vol%, 30 vol%, 40 vol%, and 50 vol% were produced. A comprehensive experimental protocol consisting of rheological studies (static and dynamic yield stress), dynamic elastic modulus determination (first 24 h of hydration), flexural and compressive strengths (2 d and 28 d), and an open porosity test was performed. The obtained results were verified by printing tests. In addition, an economic and environmental life cycle assessment (LCA) of the mixes was performed. The results indicate that up to 50 vol% cement replacement with fRA is feasible, albeit with some technical drawbacks. While fRA incorporation enhances sustainability by reducing CO2 emissions and material costs, it adversely affects the printability window, green strength, setting time, and mechanical properties, particularly in the initial curing stages. Therefore, with higher replacement rates (above 20 vol%), potential optimization efforts are needed to mitigate drawbacks such as reduced green strength and buildability. Notably, replacement rates of up to 20 vol% can be successfully used without compromising the overall material properties or altering the mixture design. The LCA analysis shows that reducing the cement content and increasing the fRA addition results in a significant reduction in mix cost (up to 24%) and a substantial decrease in equivalent CO2 emissions (up to 48%). In conclusion, this study underscores the potential of fRA as a sustainable alternative to cement in 3D printed concrete.

AB It has been demonstrated that quite a few 3D printable materials are geometrically monoclinic. In this paper, the two-scale stochastic isogeometric analyses of 3D printed curved beams are carried out to investigate effect of geometrical monocline on global behavior of a curved Timoshenko beam. The two-scale isogeometric variational principle, basis functions, and corresponding governing equations are investigated. A comparison of monoclinic, orthotropic, and isotropic structures under specific loading is made using the proposed method as well as scale model experiments. Results demonstrate that the anisotropic material feature considerably affects global behavior of 3D printing beam. Uncertainty of material property is quantified through Monte Carlo simulations for several representative 3D printed structures under distributed loading. It is indicated that porosity might be the main cause of the material anisotropic property of representative volume element (RVE).

TI Circular 3D printing of high-performance photopolymers through
   dissociative network design
SO SCIENCE
LA English
DT Article
AB One approach for closed-loop plastics recycling relies on reverting polymers back into monomers because one can then make new plastics without loss of properties. This depolymerization requirement restricts the molecular design to making polymers with high mechanical performance. We report a three-dimensional (3D) printing chemistry through stepwise photopolymerization by forming dithioacetal bonds. The polymerized network can be transformed back into a photoreactive oligomer by dissociation of the dithioacetal bonds. This network-oligomer transformation is reversible, therefore allowing circular 3D printing using the same material. Our approach offers the flexibility of making modular adjustments in the design of the network backbone of a polymer. This allows access to fully recyclable elastomers, crystalline polymers, and rigid glassy polymers with high mechanical toughness, making them potentially suitable for diverse applications.

AB Light-based processing of thermosets has gained increasing attention because of its broad application field including its use in digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. This technique offers efficient design and fabrication of complex structures but typically results in non-recyclable thermoset-based products. To address this issue, we describe here a photocurable, dynamic beta-amino ester (BAE) based cross-linker that is not only suitable for DLP printing but can also be chemically degraded via transesterification upon the addition of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as a decross-linker. This conceptually new protocol allows for efficient depolymerization with the direct restoration of curable monomers in a single step without the addition of external catalysts or solvents. By implementing this protocol, we have established a chemical recycling loop for multiple cycles of photo-cross-linking and restoration of cross-linkers, facilitating repeatable DLP 3D printing without generating any waste. The recycled materials exhibit full recovery of thermal properties and Young's modulus while maintaining 75% of their tensile strength for at least three cycles. Simultaneously, the presence of BAE moieties enables the (re)processability of these materials through compression molding.
   Photocurable dynamic cross-linkers based on beta-amino esters have been successfully synthesized. The direct restoration of such cross-linkers, enabled by a catalyst- and solvent-free protocol, is established for repeated DLP 3D printing.

AB The identification of recyclable resources are extremely important to balance the growing demand for polymer composite 3D printing and sustainable manufacturing. In the present study, SS 316L powder particle infused PLA filaments are fabricated by deriving PLA from discarded bi-material extrudates, adopting solvent mixing methodology. The matrix reclaimability, composite feedstock fabrication, extrudability and printability are investigated by increasing the solid loading from 10 - 40 wt%. Outcomes of the FTIR for 'PLA gel' and 'extrudate dissolved gel' are identical and confirms the matrix reclaimability. Essential characterization studies like XRD, TGA, and DSC are carried out for composite feedstock. The reinforcement dispersion in composites is quantified with the help of microscopy results. The melt rheological studies reveal that all the extruded filaments exhibit shear thinning over a shear rate of 50 s-1 and are compatible with 3D printing. The tensile strength is improved by 22.4% after adding 10 wt% reinforcement to the recycled PLA. The economical benefits are evaluated by comparing the composite filament fabrication with the pure PLA matrix. The study concludes recommending viscous modifiers to improve filament processability and increase loading capacity beyond 40 wt% for indirect metal additive manufacturing.

AB We present a synergetic combination of two previously separate process technologies to create novel lightweight structures. 3D textiles and 3D printing. We will outline the development of a novel material system that consisted of flexible and foldable 3D textiles that are combined with stiff, linear 3D printed materials.
   Our aim is to produce material-reduced lightweight elements for building applications with an extended functionality and recyclability. Within an ongoing research project (6dTEX), we explore a mono-material system, which uses the same base materials for both the filament for 3D printing and the yarn of the fabrication of the 3D textiles. Based on preliminary 3D printing tests on flat textiles key process parameters were identified. Expertise has been established for 3D printing on textiles as well as for using printable recycled polyester materials (PES textile and PETG filament. Lastly for 3D printing on non-combustible material (alkali-resistant (AR) glass textiles and for 3D concrete printing (3DCP).
   The described process- knowledge facilitates textile architectures with an extended vocabulary, ranging from flat to single curved and folded topologies. Whereas the foundations are laid in the research project on a meso scale, we also extended our explorations into an architectural macro scale. For this, we used a more speculative design-build studio that was based on a more loose combination of 3D textiles and 3D printed elements. Lastly, we will discuss, how this first architectural application beneficially informed the research project.

AB One of the most significant challenges for 3D printing of construction elements from cementitious materials is the control of cracking caused by various contraction-shrinkage mechanisms, such as drying, chemical, plastic and autogenous shrinkage. This study addresses the effects of incorporating fine aggregates (maximum size <= 1.18 mm), both natural and recycled, as well as short (6 mm long) polypropylene (PP) fibres on the control of cracking in cementitious mixtures based on Portland cement. Admixtures and/or mineral additions (modifiers), such as metakaolin, micro-silica, calcium carbonate, and fine powders obtained from construction and demolition wastes were used in the mixtures. Mini-slump, flow rate and buildability tests were used to characterize the mixtures in their fresh state. Extrudability was evaluated using laboratory-scale 3D printing tests conducted with a plunger-piston extrusion system. It was demonstrated that the physical characteristics of the aggregates directly influence the extrusion capacity. Mixtures containing natural aggregates exhibited greater fluidity and lower water demand than those containing recycled aggregates. The results indicated that the maximum allowable volume of fibres was 0.75%. To evaluate the cracking susceptibility of the mixtures, both with and without reinforcement, hollow beams composed of seven layers were printed, and subsequently the elements were exposed to the outdoor natural environment and inspected for a period of 90 days. The inclusion of the PP fibres effectively prevented the occurrence of fissures and/or cracks associated with shrinkage phenomena throughout the inspection period, unlike in unreinforced mixtures, which cracked after 14 days of exposure to the environment.

ID IODINE; CONVERSION
AB Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is an effective method to fabricate and develop customized and high surface area electrodes for energy storage devices, but it also produces plastic waste and material scraps during printing and optimization. To address this issue, a more sustainable approach beyond traditional chemical recycling or landfilling is essential. In this work, we upcycle 3D printing filament scrap, specifically carbon nanofiber (CNF)/polylactic acid (PLA) composites, to develop 3D-printed rechargeable Zn-I-2 batteries (3D-ZIBs), transforming scrap into functional energy storage materials. The mechanically upcycled CNF/PLA 3D printing filaments exhibit strong chemical stability, favorable electrochemical properties, and a porous structure, enhancing iodine-iodide redox conversion as a cathode host. They also support parallel-type zinc electrodeposition, enabling long-term zinc plating/stripping with exceptional stability and corrosion resistance. The upcycled CNF/PLA-based 3D ZIB exhibits capacity (195 mA h g(-1)) comparable to the fresh CNF/PLA electrode (197.7 mA h g(-1)) and maintains a robust capacity retention of 78.32% after 5000 cycles. Custom designs, including micro lattice-type, brick-shaped, and ring-shaped 3D-ZIBs with gel-based catholyte/electrolyte architecture, offer functionality tailored for wearable or space-constrained applications. This study demonstrates a sustainable approach to upcycling conducting filament scrap, addressing 3D printing plastic scrap, and promoting a circular economy.

AB Considering the prevalent strain on environmental resources imparted by existing food systems, prioritizing environmental sustainability is an imperative course of action. Subsequently, the shift towards sustainable production and consumption patterns engenders an escalating demand for environmentally conscious food systems. Thus, 3D-printed food technology surfaces are a promising solution noted for their efficacy in curtailing food waste, bolstering environmental sustainability, and imparting innovative strategies to the food supply chain. Herein, we amalgamate the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework with several variables, namely 'sensory appeal', 'food neophobia', 'perceived health risk', and 'environmental friendliness' to probe the behavioral intentions of Taiwanese university students' perceptions about 3D-printed food. Employing the snowball sampling method, 370 questionnaires were disseminated, out of which 319, constituting an effective retrieval rate of 86.2%, were deemed valid. Statistical analysis produced intriguing findings. Consumers' inclination to purchase 3D-printed food is substantially determined by their attitudes, subjective norms, sensory appeal, food neophobia, perceived health risks, and environmental friendliness. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, perceived behavioral control did not exhibit a significant impact on consumers' propensity to purchase 3D-printed food. Therefore, businesses should focus on magnifying the sensory appeal of 3D-printed food, coupled with precise nutritional labeling, to bolster consumer interest, enhance acceptance, and augment behavioral intentions. This study sheds light on the potential for the development of 3D-printed food in Taiwan, providing an indispensable reference for future endeavors in Taiwan's 3D-printed food industry.

AB Due to an increase in the number of applications for 3D printers, the use of thermoplastic resins such as acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and poly lactic acid (PLA), which are typical filament materials for fused filament fabrication (FFF) type 3D printers, has also increased significantly. This trend has produced an interest in recycled filaments, both to reduce the manufacturing cost of fabricated products and to lower greenhouse gas emissions. Also, this recycling system is very useful to make functional filament such as highly conducting or high strength filament by combining carbon nanotube or polydopamine during recycling process. This study presents the design procedures of system for making recycled filaments for 3D printers from waste polymer. The system integrates four main parts for recycling filament: a shredder, which crushes polymer waste into small pieces; an extruder, which extrudes filament from the crushed pieces; a sensing and control component, which regulates the diameter of the extruded filament via a closed-loop control system, and a spooler. Additionally, the dimensional accuracy, the mechanical strength of pristine, and recycled filaments were investigated and compared.

AB The utilization of recycled waste plastics presents a promising opportunity for the development of filament for fused filament fabrication (FFF). This approach holds the potential to effectively conserve resources, mitigate solid waste generation, and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The present study involves the processing of recycled polypropylene (rPP) into filaments with the purpose of manufacturing 3D printed components and the effects of the processing parameters on the properties of the printed parts. The selection of manufacturing parameters for 3D printing of rPP relies on the material-specific characteristic values, including glass transition temperature, melting temperature, viscosity, etc. More importantly, a novel methodology with the self-diffusion coefficient by applying the real-time cooling rate of rPP was devised to determine the total accumulated diffusion, which enables the prediction of mechanical performance by considering the local thermal conditions during material bonding between individual strands and different layers. The finding of the study indicates that the specimen fabricated by using elevated temperature and minimal time interval, which correlates with a high total accumulated diffusion, exhibited enhanced mechanical properties between the strands those are comparable to properties of the injection-molded virgin polypropylene.

AB Many types of consumer-grade packaging can be used in material extrusion additive manufacturing processes, providing a high-value output for waste plastics. However, many of these plastics have reduced mechanical properties and increased warpage/shrinkage compared to those commonly used in three-dimensional (3D) printing. The addition of reinforcing materials can lead to stiffer parts with reduced distortion. This paper presents work in the reinforcement of recycled polypropylene using cellulose waste materials to generate a green composite feedstock for extrusion-based polymer additive manufacturing. Recycled polypropylene/waste paper, cardboard, and wood flour composites were made using a solid-state shear pulverization process. Fourier transform infrared and thermogravimetric analysis were utilized to qualitatively analyze the amount of filler incorporated into the 3D-printed materials. Recycled polymer composites had increased levels of filler incorporated in the printed parts compared to the virgin polymer composites based on the thermal gravimetric analysis. The dynamic mechanical analysis showed a ca. 20-30% increase in storage modulus with the addition of cellulose materials. Tensile strength was not significantly increased with the addition of 10 wt % cellulose, but the elastic modulus increased 38% in virgin polypropylene. The analysis of fracture surfaces revealed that failure initiates at the interface, suggesting that the interfacial strength is weaker than the filler strength.

AB Limestone calcined clay cement (LC3) presents a suitable low-carbon cementitious material for large-scale 3D printing due to its long open time. This study investigates the impact of substituting up to 100 % natural aggregate with recycled brick aggregates (BA) on the engineering properties, durability and printing properties of LC3. BA's rough surface and irregular shape reduced the workability of the LC3 mixtures even though the water absorption of BA was compensated for by adding extra water. The mechanical strength increased significantly in the presence of BA of around 36 %- 62 %. Moreover, incorporating BA was found to boost the hydration and allowed it continue due to the presence of additional water in its microstructure. The water absorptions of LC3 prepared with up to 70 % replacement level of aggregates with BA were comparable to the reference mix, while a 100 % replacement level increased the water absorption by around 9 %. In contrast, incorporating BA improved the freeze-thaw resistivity by up to 25 %. Moreover, it was found that incorporating BA improved the layer quality of 3D-printed filaments. The results of this study present a breakthrough in the recycling of brick aggregates in LC3 systems for both cast and 3D printing applications, which will help develop a more environmentally friendly mixture with high engineering performance.

AB The automotive industry is frequently associated with high polluting manufacturing systems, which raise concern owing to the current environmental frame. For this reason, new alternative manufacturing technologies with lower environmental impact have been proposed and tested, such as additive manufacturing (AM). Since AM technologies produce almost no waste, they can represent a huge opportunity for the automotive industry to become greener. In this sense, the object of the present review is to explore the challenges and strategies of 3D printing, recycling, and circular economy in the automotive industry. Therefore, to achieve the aim of the study, a systematic review methodology was used in five stages: (1) defining the targets; (2) extraction of papers from Scopus; (3) text mining and corpora text analysis of relevant documents from the platform; (4) identification of the dominant categories of the research topics; and (5) discussion and control of obtained results and provision of recommendations for future studies. The analysis of 14 relevant articles revealed that 3D printing technology represents an opportunity to empower small-scale producers of polymers, recycle ELV materials, and decentralize the supply chains of plastic articles. The possibility to include plastic parts produced by AM technology has been pointed out as an innovative option for car manufacturers. Unfortunately, till the present day, poor information was found in this regard. Findings highlighted the need for strategies to turn polymeric automotive components into more eco-friendly and safer materials, improve the supply chain of polymers, perform sustainability assessments, and reformulate waste policies for ELVs.

AB Laser powder bed fusion is an attractive technology for 3D printing objects in a powder bed and has been explored for printing pharmaceutical dosage forms, such as tablets. Recycling of non-sintered residual powder is not well understood, but is critical to prevent economic losses and improve the sustainability of this technique. We investigated the recyclability of three pharmaceutical formulations in the context of laser powder bed fusion of tablets. Three formulations consisting of common pharmaceutical polymers and the model drug indomethacin have been investigated up to ten print cycles. For each print cycle, powder and tablet samples were collected and analyzed for ageing phenomena. Results showed that polyvinyl alcohol and methacrylic acid-ethyl acrylate copolymer-based formulations were recyclable without changes in critical quality attributes of printed dosage forms for 5 and 9 cycles, respectively. A copovidone-based formulation showed a gradual increase in particle size over 10 cycles, resulting in a gradual decrease in tablet weight. This formulation was considered non-recyclable under the conditions evaluated in this work. The observed ageing phenomena were mainly related to changes in particle size, powder cohesion, and glass transition temperature. It is shown that considering powder ageing during formulation development is critical for optimal print performance and further development of laser powder bed fusion for pharmaceutical applications.

AB 3D concrete printing (3DCP) is gaining much attention due to the absence of formwork, allowing more freedom in the architectural design, and reducing construction costs significantly. The lack of formwork configuration in the 3DCP technique requires the printable concrete to possess selfsupporting properties. Furthermore, the yield stress evolution over time caused by the structuration build-up of the cement also allows a larger buildable height of the print. However, before the structuration in the material occurs, the concrete needs to possess high initial yield stress to maintain its shape upon extrusion during the early stage of the printing process. Although it is advantageous to have higher yield stress for the buildability of the concrete, the extrudability of the concrete should also be considered. When the yield stress of the concrete is too high, the pumping effort to cause flow in the concrete becomes too high and the extruded filament displays defects on the surface of the filament. This study aims to study the effects of various material parameters on the concrete extrudability and buildability to determine the extrudable region of the concrete mix design using a graphical approach. The material parameters that are being studied in this research includes aggregates fraction, attapulgite nano-clay content, and aggregates fineness. The results shows that the mix designs at the extrudable limit surface is most optimal for 3D concrete printing as it has the maximum buildability with the extrudable region.

AB Fused filament fabrication three-dimensional (FFF 3-D) printing is thought to be environmentally sustainable; however, significant amounts of waste can be generated from this technology. One way to improve its sustainability is via distributed recycling of plastics in homes, schools, and libraries to create feedstock filament for printing. Risks from exposures incurred during recycling and reuse of plastics has not been incorporated into life cycle assessments. This study characterized contaminant releases from virgin (unextruded) and recycled plastics from filament production through FFF 3-D printing. Waste polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastics were recycled to create filament; virgin PLA, ABS, high and low density polyethylenes, high impact polystyrene, and polypropylene pellets were also extruded into filament. The release of particles and chemicals into school classrooms was evaluated using standard industrial hygiene methodologies. All tasks released particles that contained hazardous metals (e.g., manganese) and with size capable of depositing in the gas exchange region of the lung, i.e., granulation of waste PLA and ABS (667 to 714 nm) and filament making (608 to 711 nm) and FFF 3-D printing (616 to 731 nm) with waste and virgin plastics. All tasks released vapors, including respiratory irritants and potential carcinogens (benzene and formaldehyde), mucus membrane irritants (acetone, xylenes, ethylbenzene, and methyl methacrylate), and asthmagens (styrene, multiple carbonyl compounds). These data are useful for incorporating risks of exposure to hazardous contaminants in future life cycle evaluations to demonstrate the sustainability and circular economy potential of FFF 3-D printing in distributed spaces.

AB Additive manufacturing, also known as 3D printing can be considered as a modern technology and it enables the fabrication of complex geometrical shapes, used for prototypes or unique individual pieces. Additive manufacturing technologies have developed greatly over the last decade in terms of technology and printing materials. Special emphasis is placed on the development of cheaper materials derived from natural sources, without the release of harmful substances during the manufacturing process, with the possibility of using waste materials and recycling after service life. Wood or wood residues are among the potential raw materials that could be used for 3D printing in combinations with natural and synthetic polymers. It is anticipated that, with the development of additive technologies, the use of wood will also expand to the area of structural elements, such as in the construction of prefabricated houses. A review of publications on the topic of 3D printing with natural raw materials with an emphasis on wood biomass and technologies, where the use of wood particles is possible, was made. Some case studies of ongoing research as well as student's workshop on 3D printing design and developments will be presented.

AB Most of post-consumer plastic toys are being ended up as waste. The waste plastic toys can pose a great risk to both people and the environment; at the same time, we will lose many valuable materials that could be recycled. The aim of the present study was to explore the possibility of producing high quality products from waste plastic toys whilst enabling waste plastics to retain their original colour profile. First, the recyclability of the waste plastic toys was investigated using a single screw extruder. The physical, chemical and mechanical properties of prepared filaments were evaluated. Repeated thermo-mechanical stresses did not alter the properties of polymers significantly until ten reprocessing cycles, which suggests that waste plastic toys can be recycled at the end of their lives. Then, the filaments produced from both waste plastic toys and virgin polymer served to fabricate products using a three-dimensional (3D) printer, to examine the possibility of producing high quality products using new manufacturing techniques. The tensile strength, elastic modulus and impact strength of the printed product were found to be 32 +/- 2 MPa, 2253 +/- 271 MPa and 40 +/- 1 kJ/m(2), respectively. The mechanical properties of the 3D printed specimens from waste plastics were as good as virgin material. The process developed in this study can reduce carbon footprint and production cost. The utilisation of waste plastic toys as feedstock to produce new plastic products is not only an environment-friendly option but also profitable.

AB The pursuit of greater sustainability has driven policies that emphasize the 3Rs - reducing consumption, reusing materials, and recycling waste. Additive manufacturing (3D printing) is a technique aligned with these approaches and also allows for integration with other eco-friendly practices. Therefore, in this work, we developed an electrochemical device fabricated via 3D-printed support with a composite material of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) polymer waste, graphite and rice-husk bio-charcoal (biochar). The device was thoroughly characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. A square wave voltammetry method was developed to monitor the third-generation fluoroquinolone levofloxacin (LEV) in supply and river water samples. The optimized method showed a linear response from 1 to 20 mu mol/L and a detection limit of 0.39 mu mol/L. Moreover, the method also exhibited good precision (RSD < 6.8 %) and excellent accuracy, with recoveries of 100-107 % in spiked samples. Finally, the sensor showed robust stability and selectivity in the presence of other antibiotic and antipyretic compounds, highlighting its suitability and broad potential in electroanalytical applications.

AB The increasing demand for sustainable construction materials has intensified research into geopolymers, with a particular focus on construction and demolition waste (CDW). CDWs present a promising opportunity for reducing the environmental impact of construction by serving as recycled precursors and aggregates in sustainable geopolymeric materials. Recent studies have confirmed the viability of CDW-based geopolymers, demonstrating numerous advantages, including enhanced mechanical durability, cost-efficiency, and overall sustainability characteristics compared to Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC)-based materials. Nevertheless, several challenges continue to impede their broader adoption in the construction industry. This review synthesizes the latest findings on the mechanical properties, durability, 3D printing applications, structural performance, and sustainability features of CDW-based geopolymers, highlighting critical factors such as the influence of CDW precursors and aggregates, mix design parameters, particle packing and shape characteristics. Literature underscores the necessity for enhanced design methodologies and standardized criteria to improve the practical application of CDW-based geopolymers, particularly in optimizing the mechanical performance, durability, and 3D printing formulations. Important limitations regarding the need for research in critical areas of CDW-geopolymers have been given.

AB The unpredictable coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has led to a sudden and massive demand for face masks, leading to severe plastic pollution. Here, we propose a method for manufacturing biodegradable masks using high-precision 3D printing technology, called "TRespirator", mainly made of banana leaves and dental floss silk fibers. By adding plastic recycling waste appropriately, TRespirator can achieve similar protection and mechanical properties as N95 masks. In addition, microorganisms attracted during the degradation of plant fibers will accelerate the degradation of microplastics. This respirator provides a new idea for solving the global problem of plastic pollution of masks.

AB Recyclability of the leftover metallic powder within the Additive manufacturing (3D printing) process has been less systematically investigated by the research groups although it is a usual practice in most academic and industrial laboratories to reuse the leftover powders for subsequent printing cycles. A better understanding of these mechanisms will assist in optimizing the number of times the recycled powder can be reused in the process to reduce the powder waste. We have recently focused on characterization of recycled powders left in the powder bed after the powder bed fusion process and evaluated the extent of porosity in the powder particles. X-ray computing tomography technique (XCT) has been used to analyze the concentration of porosity, inclusions and dendrites induced inside the recycled powder particles and compared that to the fresh counterparts. The XCT resolution of 2 mu m was set to separately scan the powder badges for 3 hours. A roughly 10% more porosity has been calculated in reused powder particles (in at least 10 times reused power). Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) was used to measure the roughness of the surface of powder particles which shows average roughness of 4.29 nm and 5.49 nm for the virgin and recycled powders, respectively. Nanoindentation measurement were also applied on a number of locations of the particles to compare the hardness of the virgin and recycled powders. For example, the recycled powder shows smaller a hardness of 207 GPa and an effective modulus of 9.60 GPa (average values) compared to 237 GPa and 9.87 GPa (average values) for it's virgin counterpart which can be correlated to porosities created beneath the surface. Nanoindentation was also applied on (micro and nano) polished surface of the particles under a force of 250 nN for up to 10 seconds. The stainless Steel 316L powder has been the material under study with the powder particles of average size 50 mu m which were analyzed using Xradia XCT, Bruker Dimension ICON AFM and Bruker HYSITRON TI Nanoindentation systems. Further investigation is ongoing to correlate the mechanical properties of the manufactured parts to the microstructure and chemical compositions of the virgin and recycled powders.

AB 3D concrete printing is an emerging construction technology, and presents an opportunity for utilising materials that are otherwise considered unsuitable for concrete construction. Incorporating underutilised solids and/or waste solids as aggregates is a way of gaining the maximum environmental and economic benefits from the emerging 3D concrete printing technology. In this study, desert sand (small size), river-sediment ceramsite sand (medium size), and recycled concrete (large size) were experimentally investigated for use as aggregates in the 3D printing of concrete. Three mixtures were designed with continuous, open, and interrupted gradations of solids, respectively, based on the theory of particle interference, and aiming to meet the requirements of extrusion-based 3D printing. The influences of the particle grading characteristics on the printability-related early-age behaviours, mechanical properties, and shrinkage resistance have been measured and analysed. The test results demonstrate that the self-supporting skeletal effect formed by the gradated particles reduces the flowability of the mixtures, but the structural build-up/buildability performance is improved (under the premise of the desired printability). The interlayer distribution and skeleton of the gradated aggregate contribute to improving the interfacial interlocking effect and contact bonding between layers; this is visually validated through computed tomography (CT) scanning. Further, the addition of aggregates reduces the proportion of cementitious composites, and therefore effectively mitigates the shrinkage of the cement matrix. The grading characteristics of the underutilised particle resources are crucial for regulating the early-age 3D printability. This article provides feasible solutions based on experimental data for promoting the eco-utilisation of underutilised and waste solids in 3D printing, and these solutions satisfy the minimum strength and durability requirements.

AB Electrochemical 3D printing technology built on computer numerical control platforms has enabled multi-dimensional and multi-scale manufacturing of various metal materials through layered electrochemical deposition. Compared to thermal 3D printing technology, electrolyte meniscus-confined 3D printing can manufacture Cu microstructures with fewer defects and smoother surfaces. In the meantime, it is still susceptible to unstable liquid-solid-air interfaces, low deposition rates, and limited printing geometry. This work combined jet electrochemical deposition with a portable 3-axis platform to develop a cyclic high-speed electrolyte jet (HSEJ) 3D printer. It offers a faster deposition rate of 53.4 mu m/h when printing ultrasmooth Cu microelectrodes with surface average roughness down to 1.1 nm and microhardness of 3.3 GPa which is much higher than the best result of 2.4 GPa obtained by the other ECD methods. It is identified that the fluctuation of cathode current density plays a crucial role in defining the nucleation morphology on the Cu surface, while the cathode current efficiency is a reliable indicator to assess the deposition localization by reflecting the variation of diffusion percentage. HSEJ 3D printing provides a sustainable pathway for the facile recycling of waste cables into high-grade metal microelectronics with controllable surface morphology and 3D dimensions.

AB Waste plastic exposed to the environment creates problems and is of significant concern for all life forms. To reuse the waste plastic in a well-organized manner and make it more productive, extrusion-based additive manufacturing, specially fused deposition modeling technique, can be an effective way. Hence, the primary objective of this work is to reuse ABS waste for developing sustainable three-dimensional printing filaments. A mixed feedstock processing approach is used to develop filaments, in which recycled ABS is blended with virgin ABS in weight ratio of 10%-50%. The rheological and thermo-mechanical properties of the extruded filaments were examined. Results indicated that increasing extrusion temperature from 190 degrees C to 195 degrees C produced significant physical changes in ABS blends. There is a breakdown of styrene acrylonitrile and butadiene component in ABS which causes strain hardening and material stiffening. The Young's modulus, yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 80% RABS/20% VABS filament were found to be 2329, 34.814 and 40.82 MPa, respectively, which is close to VABS filament. The novel filament produced from recycled/virgin ABS blends has the capability to replace commercially available ABS filaments for fabricating high-quality plastic parts through an additive manufacturing routine.

AB Natural wood has served as a foundational material for buildings, furniture, and architectural structures for millennia, typically shaped through subtractive manufacturing techniques. However, this process often generates substantial wood waste, leading to material inefficiency and increased production costs. A potential opportunity arises if complex wood structures can be created through additive processes. Here, we demonstrate an additive-free, water-based ink made of lignin and cellulose, the primary building blocks of natural wood, that can be used to three-dimensional (3D) print architecturally designed wood structures via direct ink writing. The resulting printed structures, after heat treatment, closely resemble the visual, textural, olfactory, and macro-anisotropic properties, including mechanical properties, of natural wood. Our results pave the way for 3D-printed wooden construction with a sustainable pathway to upcycle/recycle natural wood.

AB Three-dimensional concrete printing technology provides the possibility to fabricate specific and eco-friendly concrete components for application on shorelines or in other areas, providing environmental protection. In this study, solid wastes in Hong Kong are employed for low-pH 3D printing concrete to further decrease the impact on the environment. The results indicate that WGP replacement in a classic low-pH recipe leads to lower yield stress and surface pH, as well as volume stability. The employment of slag improves workability and printability, but maintains the surface pH and drying shrinkage. The printing height is not merely determined by slump flow, and contributions from every binder on the surface pH are quantified based on simplified calculations. Reducing OPC and increasing SF in the classic low-pH recipe achieves the best printing performance and improved environmental friendliness.

AB Nature uses proteins as building blocks to create three-dimensional (3D) structural components (like spiderwebs and tissue) that are recycled within a closed loop. Furthermore, it is difficult to replicate the mechanical properties of these 3D architectures within synthetic systems. In the absence of biological machinery, protein-based materials can be difficult to process and can have a limited range of mechanical properties. Herein, we present an additive manufacturing workflow to fabricate tough, protein-based composite hydrogels and bioplastics with a range of mechanical properties. Briefly, methacrylated bovine-serum-albumin-based aqueous resins were 3D-printed using a commercial vat photopolymerization system. The printed structures were then treated with tannic acid to introduce additional non-covalent interactions and form tough hydrogels. The hydrogel material could be sutured and withstand mechanical load, even after immersion in water for 24 h. Additionally, a denaturing thermal cure could be used to virtually eliminate rehydration of the material and form a bioplastic. To highlight the functionality of this material, a bioplastic screw was 3D-printed and driven into wood without damage to the screw. Moreover, the 3D-printed constructs enzymatically degraded up to 85% after 30 days in pepsin solution. Thus, these protein-based 3D-printed constructs show great potential for biomedical devices that degrade in situ.

AB Designers actively pursue the use of novel materials and concepts in furniture and interior design. By providing insights into their processing behavior and suitability for 3D-printing processes, this research helps to highlight the potential of using waste materials to create more environmentally friendly and sustainable 3D-printing filaments that can be used in furniture and interior design. Furthermore, the study evaluates the effect of incorporating palm midrib nanoparticles (DPFNPs) to reinforce a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) matrix with different loadings such as 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 wt.%. The composites were extruded into filaments using a manual extruder, which was then utilized to fabricate 3D-printed specimens using a 3D-printing pen. The effect of adding DPFNPs on the composite's chemical, thermal, and mechanical properties was evaluated, with a particular focus on how these modifications influence the melt flow rate (MFR) and, subsequently, the material's printability. The results revealed that HDPE and filament composites presented similar FTIR spectra. On the other hand, the filament composites presented an increase in the thermal stability and a decrease in the mechanical strength with increasing DPFNP content in the HDPE matrix. The filaments were successfully printed using a 3D-printing pen. Thus, using DPFNPs in the HDPE matrix presents a low-cost alternative for filament production and may expand 3D-printing applications in interior and furniture design with more sustainable materials. Future work will delve into optimizing these composites for improved printability and assessing their recyclability, aiming to broaden their applications in 3D printing and beyond.

AB The usage of disposable face mask to control the spread of COVID-19 disease has led to the alarming generation of a huge amount of plastic waste in a short span of time. On other hand, face masks are made of high-quality thermoplastic polymers that could be recovered and converted into valuable products. The aim of this study is investigate a complementary approach for the recycling of face mask in lab-scale plants: the mechanical recycling of the filter in polypropylene (PP) and the chemical recycling of the whole face mask. For this purpose, a new designed surgical face mask was chemically and physically characterized. The results shows that the face mask was composed of 92.3 wt% high grade PP (filter), very similar to virgin PP but with a high melt volume index (MVI, 385 cm3/10 min) due to its non-woven manufacturing. The PP from face mask was mixed with recycled virgin PP in order to obtain a MVI suitable for the extrusion process and recycled as filament for 3D printing. This filament was used to print a specimen with a very similar visual quality of that printed with a commercial filament. Simultaneously, the whole face mask underwent a pyrolysis process to produce new feedstocks or fuels. Low-cost catalysts derived from coal fly ash (CFA) were employed to enhance the production of light hydro-carbons. In particular, the synthetized acid X zeolite (HX/CFA) improved the yield of light fractions up to 91 wt% (79 wt% for thermal pyrolysis) and the quality of the light oil with the 85% of C6-C10 (55% for thermal rolysis). Furthermore, HX/CFA decreased the degradation temperature of PP to 384 degrees C versus 458 degrees C of thermal cracking.

AB In this article we propose the EcoPrinting technology, which aims at a near zero carbon foot print means of recycling waste polymers into functional, working products. To achieve this goal, we demonstrate a nanogrid device by which solar energy can be stored in a modest sized battery system and use this to power instrumentation for melt extrusion of waste polymers into 3D printer filaments. We then use this filament in a modified 3D printer system to manufacture functional humanitarian aid components such as water seals and pipe connectors. We investigate the feasibility of the EcoPrinting principal using ABS and HDPE plastics, while evaluating and optimizing enabling device energy consumption and manufacturing performance. We conclude that the EcoPrinting principal is possible and functional devices can be manufactured with mechanical integrity equivalent to commercially available components. We finally demonstrate that EcoPrinting can be used as a tool for humanitarian use, realizing a manufacturing paradigm that is self-sufficient and potentially capable of addressing challenges of plastic proliferation in developing nations.

AB The life cycle of plastic is a key source of carbon emissions. Yet, global plastics production has quadrupled in 40 years and only 9 % has been recycled. If these trends continue, carbon emis-sions from plastic wastes would reach 15 % of global carbon budgets by 2050. An approach to reducing plastic waste is to use distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) where virgin plastic products are replaced by locally manufactured recycled plastic products that have no transportation-related carbon emissions. Unfortunately, the design of most 3-D printers forces an increase in the machine cost to expand for recycling plastic at scale. Recently, a fused granular fabrication (FGF)/fused particle fabrication (FPF) large-scale prin-ter was demonstrated with a GigabotX extruder based on the open source cable driven Hangprinter concept. To further improve that system, here a lower-cost recyclebot direct waste plastic extruder is demonstrated and the full designs, assembly and operation are detailed. The <$1,700 machine's accuracy and printing performance are quantified, and the printed parts mechanical strength is within the range of other systems. Along with sup-port from the Hangprinter and DUET3 communities, open hardware developers have a rich ecosystem to modify in order to print directly from waste plastic for DRAM.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

AB Reclaimed materials such as waste plastics can be utilized in additive manufacturing to improve the self-reliance of war fighters on forward operating bases by cutting costs and decreasing the demand for the frequent resupplying of parts by the supply chain. In addition, the use of waste materials in additive manufacturing in the private sector would reduce cost and increase sustainability, providing a high-value output for used plastics. Experimentation is conducted to process polyethylene terephthalate bottles and packaging into filament that can then be used for additive manufacturing methods like fused filament fabrication, without the use of additives or modification to the polymer. The chemistry of different polyethylene terephthalate recycled feedstocks was evaluated and found to be identical, and thus mixed feedstock processing is a suitable approach. Rheological data showed drying of the recycled polyethylene terephthalate led to an increase in the polymer's viscosity. Thermal and mechanical properties were evaluated for filament with different processing conditions, as well as printed and molded specimens. Crystallinity ranged from 12.2 for the water cooled filament, compared to 24.9% for the filament without any active cooling. Tensile results show that the elongation to failure was similar to an injection molded part (3.5%) and tensile strength of 35.1 +/- 8 MPa was comparable to commercial polycarbonate-ABS filament, demonstrating the robustness of the material. In addition, three point bending tests showed a similar load at failure for a select long-lead military part printed from the recycled filament compared to parts printed from commercial filament. Thus filament from recycled polyethylene terephthalate has the capability for replacing commercial filament in printing a diverse range of plastic parts.

AB Phosphogypsum (PG) is a phosphate fertiliser by-product. This by-product has a low level of utilisation. Calcium sulphate is dominated in PG similar to gypsum and, therefore, has good binding properties (similar to natural gypsum). However, the presence of water-soluble phosphates and fluorides, an unwanted acidic impurity in PG, makes PG unsuitable for the manufacture of gypsum-based products. In this study, the binding material of PG (beta-CaSO4<middle dot>0.5H2O) was produced from beta-CaSO4<middle dot>2H2O by calcination. To neutralise the acidic PG impurities, 0.5 wt% quicklime was added to the PG. In the construction sector, 3D-printing technology is developing rapidly as this technology has many advantages. The current study is focused on creating a 3D-printable PG mixture. The 3D-printing paste was made using sand as the fine aggregate and a binder based on PG. The results obtained show that, despite the low degree of densification, 3D printing improves the mechanical properties of this material compared to cast samples. The 3D-printed specimens tested in [u] direction reached the highest compressive strength of 950 kPa. The cast specimens showed a 17% lower compressive strength of 810 kPa. The 3D-printed specimens tested in the [v] and [w] directions reached a compressive strength of 550 kPa and 710 kPa, respectively.

The 3D printing technique can be used to make prosthesis sockets from recycled PA2200 powder, but the mechanical properties of these printed materials have not been studied in detail. Tensile and bending tests were performed, and the results obtained did not show statistically significant differences. An improperly fitted prosthesis affects the biomechanics of gait. The posture and gait analysis of a person wearing a prosthesis was performed using the "Qualisys", "AMTI" force plates and "Zebris" systems, and the results showed differences between the prosthetic and the healthy leg.

AB Nanocomposites, are materials that incorporate nanosized particles into a matrix of standard material, have emerged as a versatile class of materials with tunable properties for a wide range of applications. Traditional fabrication approaches, including physical blending, in situ polymerization, layer-by-layer assembly, and sol-gel synthetic methods, have been widely employed to develop nanocomposites with high structural homogeneity and tailored properties. This review presents a cohesive and comprehensive overview of nanocomposite fabrication methods, spanning from conventional synthetic strategies to cutting-edge approaches such as 3D printing technologies. How 3D printing has driven innovations in nanocomposite applications, particularly in biomedicine, soft robotics, electronics, and water treatment, is explored. Additionally, key challenges in 3D-printed nanocomposite development are discussed, and emerging advancements such as 5D printing, artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted material optimization, nanoscale additive manufacturing, and closed-loop recycling systems are highlighted. By bridging traditional synthesis with cutting-edge fabrication techniques, this review aims to provide insights into the future directions of nanocomposite research and applications.

AB To enhance the sustainability of 3D printed concrete (3DPC), this study investigates the synergistic utilization of recycled fine aggregate (RFA) and clay brick powder (CBP) as partial replacements for natural fine aggregate and cement, respectively. The primary objectives were to evaluate the effects of this combined substitution on the residual mechanical performance and crack evolution patterns of 3DPC specimens after exposure to elevated temperatures, aiming to develop a cost-effective, low-carbon 3DPC with enhanced thermal resilience. 3DPC mixtures and its mold-cast counterpart with 50 % RFA and 10 % CBP, alongside control specimens (without recycled materials), were exposed to temperatures ranging from 20 degrees C to 800 degrees C for 1 or 2 h. Post-exposure, residual compressive strength and crack patterns were analyzed. Microstructural evolution, including pore structure changes and phase transformations, was characterized using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP), sorptivity tests, and X-ray diffraction (XRD) to elucidate underlying degradation mechanisms. Test results demonstrate that although the incorporation of 10 % CBP and 50 % RFA reduced the compressive strength at ambient temperature, it significantly enhanced the residual strength retention rate after high-temperature exposure, due to the crack-inhibiting and internal curing effect provided by CBP and RFA. However, the internal curing effect was evident only at temperatures below 400 degrees C and for retaining times of 1 h or less. Although a similar degradation trend in the residual compressive strength with the increasing temperature was observed for 3DPC and mold-cast concrete having the same formulation, 3DPC exhibited unique cracking patterns, with cracks preferentially propagating along interlayer and interstrip interfaces due to steam channeling, contrasting with the dispersed cracking in mold-cast counterparts. Furthermore, the addition of recycled materials amplified the anisotropy of 3DPC at both ambient and elevated temperatures, with a minimum anisotropy observed at 200 degrees C due to directional strength variations. This work highlights the potential of using recycled materials in 3DPC to enhance its high temperature performance, providing valuable insights for sustainable 3D printing in construction.

AB The incorporation of recycled ceramic brick powder (RCBP) into conventional cast concrete has proofed its efficacy in substituting aggregates, improving strength, and contributing to environmental sustainability. Concurrently, 3D printing technology is emerging as a pivotal trend in intelligent construction. This study investigates the collaborative interaction mechanisms of 3Dprinted RCBP concrete. Compressive and four-point bending tests along the x, y, and z-axis are conducted to evaluate its strength and anisotropy. Subsequently, the hydration products and pore structural characteristics were analyzed employing Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and XCT experiments. Additionally, an environmental life cycle analysis is performed utilizing OpenLCA software. The results determined an optimal RCBP content of 25-wt% yields satisfactory performance in macro-mechanical properties (with maximal 65.57 MPa for compressive strength and 12.66 MPa for flexural strength) and micro-structural characterization. Specifically, the drainage consolidation effect achieved through 3D printing technology mitigates the typical decline observed in conventional RCBP concrete. However, exceeding the 25-wt% threshold leads to a noticeable decline in mechanical strength due to inhomogeneous particle gradation and excessive aggregation of RCBP particles, despite a significant reduction in porosity. Furthermore, as RCBP incorporation increases from 0-wt% to 100-wt%, four environment impact indicators including Global warming potential (GWP), Acidification Potential (AP), Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP), and Abiotic depletion potential (ADP) respectively decline by 24.86 %, 6.59 %, 0.49 %, and 0.62 %, demonstrating exceptional environmental benefits. Notably, the tremendous influence on GWP is attributed to the remarkable carbon sequestration of RCBP, aligning with national carbon neutrality goals and advancing sustainable construction practices.

AB Additive manufacturing is swiftly transitioning from a prototyping tool to a useful technology for industrial-scale manufacturing. As global industries seek to harness its potential, several 3D printing technologies have been successfully integrated into mainstream manufacturing workflows, based on the range of processable materials, fabrication mechanisms and integration into regulated environments. While metal 3D printing has established a significant niche in the context of aerospace and automotive manufacturing, the upscaled translation of polymer 3D printing lags, limited by several critical challenges, both in the materials domain, as well as the technical fabrication mechanisms. This article seeks to juxtapose the growth, challenges and opportunities of metal and polymer additive manufacturing, emphasizing the latter's potential for future growth in sectors such as polymer waste recycling and point-of-care medical device manufacturing. By dissecting the complexities surrounding feedstocks, manufacturing and post-processing workflows and the advances in simulations and quality control, this review provides comprehensive insights into the progression of 3D printed technologies for industrial-scale additive manufacturing into the future.

AB This research aimed to investigate the suitability of recycled plastic bottle material as 3D printer filament, by the evaluation of the final 3D product from the filament. It focused on developing a 3D filament using High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) recycled bottle. The filament is then used at an open source 3D printer to print a 3D product. Comparison with Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filament's product for tensile strength test, elongation and tensile modulus is done. The result shows that ABS is 42% higher tensile strength and 75% higher tensile modulus value than HDPE but the elongation data shows that the HDPE material has 95% higher elongation rate compared to ABS. This conclude that HDPE is more flexible than ABS thus, is suitable to produce high flexibility product with the open source 3D printer.

AB The escalating waste generation from multicolored 3D printing polylactic acid (PLA), presents a significant recycling challenge due to color incompatibility for conventional reprocessing into filament spools. To address this, we explored an innovative approach by repurposing this waste PLA into high-performance nanofibrous adsorbent mats for oil spill remediation. Nanofiber mats were successfully electrospun from various colored PLA waste materials dissolved in a suitable solvent system incorporating a volatile component to enhance porosity and surface area. The resulting nanofiber mats were comprehensively characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine fiber morphology and fiber-to-bead ratio. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) confirms that colorants and additives introduce trace elements that influence fiber morphology. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to identify any structural alterations post-electrospinning compared to the original materials. The oil adsorption capacities of nine colored PLA nanofiber mats and one industrial-grade PLA nanofiber mat were evaluated. The Transparent filament nanofiber mats exhibited exceptional performance, reaching up to 92.4 g/g for silicone and 81.6 g/g for cooking oil. A mixed blend nanofiber mat also demonstrated superior adsorption, 64.24 g/g for cooking oil, nearly doubling L175's capacity. The samples retained up to 82.1 % of their initial n-hexane adsorption capacity over seven cycles. The regeneration of initial adsorption capacity was achieved upon recycling multi-cycled nanofiber mats through re-dissolution and re-electrospinning, validating the reversibility of performance loss and the robustness of active sites. This study highlights a sustainable pathway for valorizing challenging-to-recycle multicolored 3D printing waste into effective, reusable, and recyclable materials for environmental remediation.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing as it is more commonly known, is the process of creating 3D objects from digital models through the sequential deposition of material in layers. Electrochemical 3D printing is a relatively new form of AM that creates metallic structures through electrochemical reduction of metal ions from solutions onto conductive substrates. The advantage of this process is that a wide range of materials and alloys can be deposited under ambient conditions without thermal damage and more importantly at low cost, as this does not require expensive laser optics or inert gas environments. Other advantages include the fact that this process can be both additive and subtractive through reversal of potential allowing for recycling of components through electrochemical dissolution. However, one main limitation of this technology is speed. Here, a novel electrochemical 3D printer design is proposed using a meniscus confinement approach which demonstrates deposition rates three orders of magnitude higher than equivalent systems due to improved mass transport characteristics afforded through a mechanical electrolyte entrainment mechanism. Printed copper structures exhibit a polycrystalline nature, with decreasing the grain size as the potential is increased resulting in a higher Vickers hardness and electronic resistivity.

AB The post-hardened pore structure's characteristics and the properties of concrete are strongly connected. This study uses 3D printed concrete (3DPC) as the sample to examine how the porosity, average diameter, and printing parameters affect strength after hardened. In order to accomplish the time-dependent management of the concrete pore structure, pre-embedding microorganisms and employing recycled aggregates as carriers were used which rises concrete strength. According to the experimental findings, the porosity of 3DPC is more directly connected to strength increase, and the variation in average diameters represents the strength of anisotropy. Comparing the microbially repaired samples to the control group, the pore structure revealed a 5.66% reduction in 28 day porosity, a maximum reduction in mean pore size of 49.67 mu m, and a smaller dispersed pore size for the same volume. Based on the anisotropy coefficient, a prediction model for the time-dependent strength in 3DPC was put forth, and the computed values were confirmed to be the best fit in the Y-axis with the experimental results. The strength performance in the X-axis of the printed specimens after pore structure repair was greater than that of the cast one, and the anisotropy difference was comparatively less.

AB Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) 3D printing creates components by layering extruded material. Printer parameters such as layer height and infill density can greatly impact the mechanical properties and quality of the printed parts. One critical factor to be considered in analysis is the anisotropy nature of printed components, considering all cross-sectional area (CSA) profiles for less than 100% infill density. This paper investigates the effect of the anisotropy nature of 3D printed CSA has on stress calculations and hence mechanical properties of the specimen through Design of Experiment (DOE). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is utilised to evaluate the results. Printed specimens were tensile tested as per ASTM D638-14. Raw data was analysed using various CSA profiles, taking changes in infill density and layer height into account. Fixed parameter such as shell count, top and bottom layers, nozzle diameter, Hexagonal pattern were defined. Specimens Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) values increased on average by 30% using average profile CSA data compared to using external specimen dimensions. Further analysis assessing printer parameters affect on recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (rPET) specimen's Young's Modulus (YM) and UTS was studied. One significant finding from this study suggests that the thickness of each layer has the most significant impact on the material properties of 3D printed rPET, as observed through the analysis of tensile test data obtained from 3D printed samples. A 3D printed rPET specimen with 30% infill density and 0.25 mm layer height has a higher YM (1175 MPa) and UTS (39 MPa) compared to a specimen with 75% infill density and 0.1 mm layer height (1159 MPa, 31 MPa). However careful interpretation of the results is required because for the same 30% infill parameter at 0.2 mm layer height the YM (936 MPa) and UTM (28 MPa) are significantly lower than at 0.25 mm layer height. If a higher value of YM and UTS is required an infill setting of 50% and layer height of 0.25 mm gave the highest values, YM (1330 MPa) and UTS (43 MPa).

AB A cyclic economy and sustainability-driven production are key aspects of the industry. Recycled feedstocks are steadily replacing virgin materials to produce parts and as sustainable additives to develop eco-friendly composites. The reinforcing potential of recycled fine powder glass (FPG) on terephthalate glycol (PETG) is investigated. The performances of six different compounds (with FPG loadings of 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, 8.0, 10.0, and 12.0 wt %) in filament and three-dimensional (3D) specimens form (manufactured with the material extrusion - MEX method) were compared with PETG pure. This research included thermal and rheological analyses, mechanical tests, and morphological and structural investigations. According to these findings, the PETG/RFPG 8.0 wt% composite presented remarkable results in the tensile and flexural (16.3 % and 16.9 % strength increase, respectively) tests, while PETG/RFPG 10.0 wt% had the greatest performance concerning microhardness. Both the dimensional deviation and porosity results show excellent performance in the case of PETG/RFPG 6.0 wt%, by being 67.3 % and 87.1 % improved vs. the PETG pure. These results indicate that RFPG is a promising reinforcement additive for MEX 3D printing that can replace the commonly used inorganic fillers and promote the sustainability of 3D printing.

AB As the flexibility, efficiency, and application space of additive manufacturing continues to grow, many have begun to investigate more sustainable feedstocks as well as options for the end of life of additively manufactured parts. This study examines the effects of mechanical recycling on additively manufactured parts from bio-based feedstock. Articles were printed on the Big Area Additive Manufacturing (BAAM) system at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory using poly (lactic acid)/wood flour (PLA/WF) pellets. These parts were shredded and granulated, and the granulate was fed directly back into the BAAM system for re-printing, skipping the costly and energy-intensive steps of extrusion and pelletization. The chemical, mechanical, thermal, and rheological changes to PLA/WF before and after recycling were investigated. Additionally, the energy savings from directly printing granulate on the BAAM system without extrusion and pelletization is reported. It is shown that PLA/WF is an excellent candidate for recycling of large format additively manufactured parts, and value of these parts can be reclaimed while saving cost and energy through mechanical recycling.

AB The most abundant e-waste plastic is acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), which is not typically processed by municipal programs and is equally one of the most popular 3-D printing filaments. This makes ABS a prime candidate for the distributed recycling for additive manufacturing (DRAM) approach, which has the potential to increase recycling rates by providing economic incentive for consumers to recycle. For DRAM to be globally applicable, this study investigates the role of the ABS e-waste source and processes to fabricate 3-D printing filament and printed components in both Australia and North America. The study used two different open source extruder systems to convert e-waste into 3D printer filament and for material quality to be assessed through standardized tensile and compression testing. Results revealed a modest reduction in mechanical properties compared to virgin ABS, highlighting the potential for recycled e-waste ABS for consumer and industrial uses. We also show DRAM can significantly reduce 3-D printer filament cost, however, carbon emissions from conversion underscored the need for technical efficiency improvements in electricity generating between countries. Finally, the variations in the properties of the ABS e-waste indicates the need for appropriate labeling of materials in order to advance recycling.

AB In past two decades, numerous 3D printing applications of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) based mechanically blended composites for secondary (2 degrees) recycling has been reported. But hitherto little has been reported on correlation of rheological, thermal, mechanical and morphological properties of chemical assisted mechanically blended ABS-Graphene (Gr) composite as tertiary (3 degrees) recycling. In the present work chemical assisted mechanical blending of ABS and Gr nano particles (size 5-10 nm in three different weight proportions i.e. 10, 15 and 20%) has been reported. The effect of increasing Gr proportion was studied for establishing the correlation among rheological (melt flow index (MFI)) and viscosity), thermal, mechanical and morphological properties. The results of the MFI and viscosity testing showed that 20%Gr in ABS decreases the MFI and increases the viscosity of the composite matrix. The thermal testing showed that ABS+20%Gr composite have highest heat capacity (0.84 j/g) among selected proportions of matrix. As regards to mechanical properties are concerned, best settings are: ABS+20%Gr, temperature 210 degrees C with 0.5 Nm torque for filament wire preparation on twin screw extruder (TSE). Morphological properties of filament wires were studied on metallurgical microscope to observe porosity percentage (%) in wire samples which was found minimum for ABS+20Gr.

AB Polylactic acid (PLA) is an eco-friendly polymer known for its biodegradability and biocompatibility, yet its properties are sensitive to recycling and sterilization. These processes may cause chain scission and structural irregularities, leading to reduced strength, brittleness, or unpredictable deformation. In this study, PLA and recycled PLA (Re-PLA) specimens were produced by FDM 3D printing with different infill rates (25%, 50%, 75%), layer thicknesses (0.15, 0.20, 0.25 mm), and printing orientations (0 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees). Steam sterilization at 121 degrees C and 1 bar for 15 min simulated biomedical conditions. Mechanical, surface, degradation, and biocompatibility properties were examined using three-point bending, roughness measurements, SEM, and cell viability tests. Results showed that infill rate was the main parameter affecting flexural strength and surface quality, while orientation increased roughness. Sterilization and recycling made deformation less predictable, particularly in St-Re-PLA. SEM revealed stronger bonding at higher infill, but more brittle fractures in PLA and Re-PLA, while sterilized specimens showed ductile features. No visible degradation occurred at any infill level. Regression analysis confirmed that second-order polynomial models effectively predicted flexural strength, with layer thickness being most influential. These findings provide critical insights into optimizing PLA and Re-PLA processing for biomedical applications, particularly in the production of sterilizable and recyclable implantable devices.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) of biomaterials has evolved from a rapid prototyping tool into a viable approach for the manufacturing of patient-specific implants over the past decade. It can tailor to the unique physiological and anatomical criteria of the patient's organs or bones through precise controlling of the structure during the 3D printing. Silicone elastomers, which is a major group of materials in many biomedical implants, have low viscosities and can be printed with a special AM platform, known as freeform 3D printing systems. The freeform 3D printing systems are composed of a supporting bath and a printing material. Current supporting matrices that are either commercially purchased or synthesized were usually disposed of after retrieval of the printed part. In this work, we proposed a new and improved supporting matrix comprises of synthesized calcium alginate microgels produced via encapsulation which can be recycled, reused, and recovered for multiple prints, hence minimizing wastage and cost of materials. The dehydration tolerance of the calcium alginate microgels was improved through physical means by the addition of glycerol and chemical means by developing new calcium alginate microgels encapsulated with glycerol. The recyclability of the heated calcium alginate microgels was also enhanced by a rehydration step with sodium chloride solution and a recovery step with calcium chloride solution via the ion exchange process. We envisaged that our reusable and recyclable biocompatible calcium alginate microgels can save material costs, time, and can be applied in various freeform 3D printing systems.

TI Use of polymer concrete for large-scale 3D printing
SO RAPID PROTOTYPING JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
DE 3D printing; Robotic fabrication; Polymer concrete; Recycled
   thermoplastic
AB Purpose
   This paper aims to focus on the evaluation of a polymer concrete as a three-dimensional (3D) printing material. An associated company has developed plastic concrete made from reused unrecyclable plastic waste. Its intended use is as a construction material.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The concrete mix, called PolyBet, composed of polypropylene and glass sand, is printed by the fused deposition modelling process. The process of material and parameter selection is described. The mechanical properties of the filled material were compared to its cast state. Samples were made from castings and two different orientations of 3D-printed parts. Three-point flex tests were carried out, and the area of the break was examined. Computed tomography of the samples was carried out.
   Findings
   The influence of the 3D printing process on the material was evaluated. The mechanical performance of the longitudinal samples was close to the cast state. There was a difference in the failure mode between the states, with cast parts exhibiting a tougher behaviour, with fractures propagating in a stair-like manner. The 3D-printed samples exhibited high degrees of porosity.
   Originality/value
   The results suggest that the novel material is a good fit for 3D printing, with little to no degradation caused by the process. Layer adhesion was shown to be excellent, with negligible effect on the finished part for the longitudinal orientation. That means, if large-scale testing of buildability is successful, the material is a good fit for additive manufacturing of building components and other large-scale structures.

AB 3D printing technologies are being called on to revolutionize the manufacturing industry of the energy sector, especially when involving functional materials and complete devices. These additive manufacturing technologies show competitive advantages over conventional processes, however only a few studies have assessed their environmental implications. In this work, the environmental performance of a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell stack produced using a novel 3D printing approach is conducted for the first time using Life Cycle Assessment. In addition, a comparative study with conventional manufacturing methods is carried out. The results reveal that the production of the 3D printing materials has the highest environmental impact (between 50% and 98%) in half of the categories studied. In contrast, the end-of-life stage represents less than 1% of the total impact. End-of-life scenarios are also presented and discussed, indicating that a recycling rate of 70% for Nickel and YSZ materials performs better than the defined landfill and incineration disposal scenarios. Furthermore, 3D printing shows the best overall environmental performance compared to other conventional methods. The main improvement is seen in the material production stage, where a savings ranging from 37% to 97% (depending on the category analysed) is observed. This is mainly due to the use of a ceramic material for the interconnects instead of Chromium-based alloys used in a more conventional approach. Finally, it was observed that the energy required for 3D printing in the manufacturing stage is a sensible parameter to the environmental performance of the SOFC 3D printing technology.

AB Electronic waste recycling is a recognized global challenge that requires new strategies to bind and release critical materials selectively, such as cobalt present in lithium-ion batteries. To address this challenge, hierarchical 3D-printed porous polymer scaffolds bearing supramolecular receptors were prepared using vat photopolymerization and their cobalt binding profiles were examined as a function of matrix polarity. By combining high-resolution digital light processing (DLP) with polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS), functional acrylic copolymer networks with micrometer-level precision of geometry and nanometer-level pores were generated. Covalent integration of a methacrylate-functionalized bisdicyclohexyl acetamide (BDCA-MA) receptor enabled binding and release of cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) via a solvent polarity switch mechanism involving a change in solvent from ethanol to water. The present structures proved reusable as shown by sustained high binding efficiency over five bind and release cycles. This platform represents a "green" and energy conscious method for future electronic waste recycling.

AB The recycling and reuse of solid wastes mark the construction industry's development towards sustainable and green technologies. 3D printing technology using recycled solid materials is in great demand for intelligent and low-carbon construction. This paper incorporates crumb rubber (0-1 mm) into the printing ink and analyses the fresh and hardened properties. The results showed that the flowability was positively correlated with rubber ratio but negatively with fiber content. R40F15 (40% rubber and 1.5% fiber) obtained the optimal flowability for 3D printing, which remained above 15 mm for 30min. The compressive strength peaked when incorporating 1.5% fiber, while the flexural strength reached the bottom. X direction generated the highest compressive strength in the whole anisotropic tests, followed by the Y and Z directions. The highest strengths of 1.5% and 2.0% fiber content were 69.45 MPa and 64.5 MPa, incorporating 20% rubber. Thus, surfaces anticipated to bear higher loads in compression should be aligned with the X-axis or, at a minimum, avoid alignment with the Z-axis for optimal structural performance. Y direction obtained the highest flexural strength in all anisotropic tests when incorporating 1.5% fiber. Results from digital image correlation test supported that fiber tended to agglomerate in the Y direction. Besides, the environmental analysis was conducted in this paper to quantitively calculate the impacts of all raw materials to the environment.

AB Due to factors such as low water-to-cement ratio, high cement content, absence of formwork, and high surface area-to-volume ratio, 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) is prone to early plastic shrinkage and cracking, posing risks to mechanical properties and long-term durability. This paper investigated the influence of substituting natural river sand with recycled brick fine aggregates (RBFA) on the performance of 3DPC during plastic phase of hydration. In this study, two different strategies for incorporating RBFA were evaluated: dry RBFA-D and water-saturated RBFA-W. The water absorption-release characteristics of RBFA impact water evaporation rate, the growth of capillary pressure and the evolution of elastic modulus, thereby influencing the plastic shrinkage of 3DPC. RBFA-W continuously releases water into the paste, offsetting water evaporation, decreasing the rise in capillary pressure, and thereby reducing plastic shrinkage. Conversely, adding RBFA-D speeds up capillary pressure growth, yet its rapid increase in elastic modulus strengthens its capacity to resist plastic shrinkage. Based on the water transport, structural development, and plastic shrinkage evolution, three clear stages were distinguished in this research. This study presents a new strategy to mitigate plastic shrinkage of 3DPC using RBFA.

AB Carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic materials have attracted several applications, including the fused deposition modelling (FDM) process. As a cheaper and more environmentally friendly alternative to its virgin counterpart, the use of milled recycled carbon fiber (rCF) has received much attention. The quality of the feed filament is important to avoid filament breakage and clogged nozzles during the FDM printing process. However, information about the effect of material parameters on the mechanical and physical properties of short rCF-reinforced FDM filament is still limited. This paper presents the effect of fiber loading (10 wt%, 20 wt%, and 30 wt%) and fiber size (63 mu m, 75 mu m, and 150 mu m) on the filament's tensile properties, surface roughness, microstructure, porosity level, density, and water absorptivity. The results show that the addition of 63 mu m fibers at 10 wt% loading can enhance filament tensile properties with minimal surface roughness and porosity level. The addition of rCF increased the density and reduced the material's water intake. This study also indicates a clear trade-off between the optimized properties. Hence, it is recommended that the optimization of rCF should consider the final application of the product. The findings of this study provide a new manufacturing strategy in utilizing milled rCF in potential 3D printing-based applications.

AB Purpose of this paper is replacing wooden pattern to the polymer by 3D printing, Plastic is most common raw material for 3D printing for making any type of item from 3D printing the item made with this procedure incorporate work area. Utensils, container and action figure accessible in straightforward structure plastic fibre are sold on spool and has a matte and bright it is also available in transparent form and bright colour.
   Sand casting is an ancient process of manufacturing it is integrated through the 3D printing for making pattern, in conventional sand casting the component make by pouring molten metal into moulds structure is made by compacting is around (for example - set in a form of box) after the compaction pattern is pulled back from where liquid metal is poured Pattern is making by wood because it available easily and machining, it has high compressive strength to its grain that is suitable for compaction moulding there is less failure during the operation. But it not reduces the environment effect that why we are use polymer.
   Polymer recycle and reduce the environment effect which is occur from the polymeric waste 3D printers use that west of raw materials into useful product. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The discovery of plastics as useful materials for human existence, providing comfort and ease has now turned into a menace in the society and a pain in the neck as plastics have also become co-habitat of the human ecosystem. Plastics were made by men, but plastics now live way longer than the men who gave them the privilege of existence. Since these colonies of materials cannot be eradicated, it is very pertinent to discover possible ways of useful diversion through recycling by converting plastic bottle waste into useful raw materials for other sectors of the economy. This paper has stirred the pool of relevant literature to extract some of the innovative efforts that have been deployed into redirecting the potential of plastic waste into useful applications like engineering and building construction, horticulture in agriculture, and the most advanced application is the 3D printing using plastics as filaments. Following the trend of technology, 3D printing is a grey area of plastic recycling, it is quite expensive however, it worth exploring.

AB In this work, an open beam-limiting device, consisting of a rectangular collimator to be coupled to an intraoral dental X-ray device, was made using recycled lead sheets as a radiation-absorbing element. The collimator was designed for 3D printing, and using Spektr 3.0 software, the number of lead sheets needed to absorb excess radiation was calculated. The rectangular collimator reduced the radiation dose to patients by 65% when using four layers of recycled lead sheets (saturating with a 70% reduction in radiation dose at the limit of eight or more sheets of lead). The rectangular collimator does not negatively impact the quality of the radiological image, is available as an open design for 3D printing, and can be built with materials that are easily accessible to the dentist, facilitating its use in clinical practice and reducing the patient's exposure to ionizing radiation.

AB The most prevalent materials used in the Additive Manufacturing era are polymers and plastics. Unfortunately, these materials are recognized for their negative environmental impact as they are primarily nonrecyclable, resulting in environmental pollution. In recent years, a new sustainable alternative to these materials has been emerging: Reversible Covalent Bond-Containing Polymers (RCBPs). These materials can be recycled, reprocessed, and reused multiple times without losing their properties. Nonetheless, they have two significant drawbacks when used in 3D printing. First, some require adding new materials every reprinting cycle, and second, others require high temperatures for (re)printing, limiting recyclability, and increasing energy consumption. This study, thus, introduces fully recyclable RCBPs as a sustainable approach for radiation-based printing technologies. This approach enables multiple (re)printing cycles at low temperatures (50 degrees C lower than the lowest reported) without adding new materials. It involves purposefully synthesized polymers that undergo reversible photopolymerization, composed of a tin-based catalyst. An everyday microwave oven quickly depolymerized these polymers, obtaining complete reversibility.
   A novel sustainable 3D printing approach, resulting in fully recyclable thermosets with multiple printing cycles at low temperatures, is presented. This study pushes the boundaries of light-based printing technologies while introducing novel compositions and reversible photopolymerization reactions, using a microwave that enables greener and more efficient additive manufacturing without any replenishing materials for (re)printing.image

AB Compared to traditional concrete, 3D printing concrete requires a larger amount of cement, which has a negative impact on environment. Therefore, it is necessary to expand the types of supplementary cementitious materials (SCM) available for 3D printing concrete and to compare the effects of different SCMs on the same type of concrete. The aim of this study is to gain a better insight into the effects of recycled powder (RP) and dolomite powder (DP) on 3D printing mortar (3DPM). In order to assess the feasibility of incorporating waste powders into 3DPM, DP and RP were used to replace cement by mass at 0 wt%, 2.5 wt%, 5 wt%, 7.5 wt% and 10 wt%, respectively, to investigate printability (fluidity, open time, buildability), mechanical properties (compressive & flexural strength, interlayer bond strength) and environmental performance (CO2 2 emissions, energy consumption). The results showed that both DP and RP improved fluidity and prolonged open time, albeit with reduced mechanical strength. In particular, DP at dosages (0-5 wt%) can improve buildability and interlayer bond strength, while its dedolomitisation reaction increases later-stage strengths. Both powders reduce energy consumption and CO2 2 emissions, but RP's contribution dosages not fully compensate for the loss in compressive strength. In addition, the study recommends 5 wt% DP as the optimum dosage, while RP should be limited to <= 5 wt% to balance mechanical performance and environmental benefits.

AB 3D printing cementitious materials (3DPC) with fly ash usually presents problems with retardation of hydration reaction and low strength development at early ages, which does not match the requirements of the 3D printing process. Incorporating limestone aggregate micro fines (AMF) is a way of gaining both the performance and environmental benefits from the technology of 3DPC. This paper investigates the influences of AMF, mainly at forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), on the fluidity, extrudability, shape stability, green strength, hydration heat, and strength development of 3D printing mortar with FA. It is shown that the mini-slump and extrudability of mixtures are decreased with the increase of AMF contents. However, the shape stability, green strength, and Young's modulus of mixtures containing AMF in the process of 3D printing are found to be higher than those of reference mixture without AMF, and these properties also increase with increasing AMF contents. The increased shape stability, green strength, and Young's modulus can be ascribed to the irregular morphology of AMF particles. The additional hydration products due to the accelerating effects of AMF also contribute to improving the load-bearing internal skeleton. In addition, while 3D printing mortar with FA and AMF is characterized by low compressive strength at early ages, their long-term strength typically meets or exceeds that of reference mortar due to the synergy effects between FA and AMF. This study provides a feasible solution, satisfying the fresh and hardened performance requirements, for the use of AMF in 3D printing mortar.

AB 3D printing technologies are innovating several industrial fields for their ability to produce complex shapes, reduce material use and obtain high-performance structures. Among the possible applications of 3D printing in the civil construction sector, manufacturing formwork for concrete casting is a promising solution for producing thin-walled and complex structures. Given the increasing interest and numerous applications being developed, comprehensive studies on the sustainability of 3D-printed concrete formwork are required to improve the processes and drive low-carbon construction practices. In this context, the present study provides for the first time an evaluation of the environmental and economic sustainability of concrete structures achieved using 3D printed formwork. The research investigates the influence of various factors such as: i) geometry complexity, ii) printing technology (Fused Deposition Modelling and Material Jetting), iii) process parameters, iv) raw materials (PLA, ABS, PVA, Geopolymers, Cements, Clay) v) machines kinematic systems and vi) End of Life alternatives. To perform such an investigation, a parametric CAD model was developed to define structure geometry; furthermore, Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing methodologies were applied to calculate the impacts and cost of the different alternatives. The results showed that a proper choice of the combination of geometry, technology, material, and process parameters is crucial for reducing the carbonization-related impacts associated with 3D-printed formwork production. In addition, reuse and recycling of the formworks cut overall impacts, making 3D printing a sustainable alternative to traditional production processes while allowing greater design freedom.

AB Reducing carbon footprint in the construction industry by leveraging construction waste aligns well with the concept of sustainable development in this sector. In this study, recycled fine aggregates (RFA) as the raw material for 3D printed mortar (3DPM), and devised three carbonation techniques: elevated temperature accelerated carbonation of RFA, injecting CO 2 as an admixture for the fresh 3DPM mixing (CO 2 -injecting), and carbonation curing of 3DPM, to improve properties of 3DPM. The study employed the digital image correlation method to evaluate plastic shrinkage of 3DPM specimens, and compared their mechanical properties. Additionally, SEM-EDS results were integrated to analyze the mechanisms of improvement associated with the carbonation methods. The findings indicated that using RFA resulted in a minor reduction in the plastic shrinkage of 3DPM. After carbonation treatments, the plastic shrinkage of mortar exhibited a significant decrease, while alleviating in moisture loss of 3DPM specimens. In the horizontal direction, all specimens displayed a "trapezoidal compression", while a "slope settling" behavior was exhibited in the vertical direction. The strength of the casting specimens experienced the most substantial improvement. Furthermore, the interlayer structure of 3DPM was enhanced by carbonation treatments, resulting in the refinement of interlayer microcracks and a strengthening of interlayer bonding.

AB This study proposes 3D-printed rubberized concrete (3DPRC) as an innovative permanent formwork solution that integrates recycled rubber aggregates (RA) with 3D concrete printing (3DCP) technology to resolve interfacial bonding and durability limitations. A systematic evaluation of RA dosage (0-15 %), particle size (30-70 mesh), and surface treatments (water-soaking, cement coating, and heat treatment) demonstrated that 5 % unmodified 50-mesh RA optimizes interlayer adhesion, yielding a compressive strength of 49.78 MPa, flexural strength of 10.59 MPa, exceptional freeze-thaw resistance (>600 cycles), and low chloride ion permeability (diffusion coefficient of 6.99 x 10(-12) m(2)/s). The absorption-desorption process of RA reduces surface water films on printed filaments and facilitates internal curing at interfaces, suppressing elongated pore formation and refining pore geometry. These synergistic effects enhance interfacial bond strength while mitigating mechanical anisotropy, thereby validating 3DPRC's suitability as a high-performance permanent formwork system.

AB Recently, the demand for high-performance, 3D-printable polymer composites has grown exponentially. The objective of this work is to develop a novel low cost and sustainable biochar-recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) composite with improved mechanical and thermal performance. Biochar was derived from the pyrolysis of packaging waste at a high temperature and autogenic pressure. The typical temperature and pressure of the reaction are similar to 1100 degrees C and 150 bar. Biochar was ground and sieved to below 100 mu m, and it was melt compounded with recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) derived from postconsumer PET bottles (Aquafina). Biochar/PET composite filaments of 1.75 mm were produced using a melt extruder. The filaments were used to 3D print tensile, DMA, and TMA sample coupons using a Hyrel 30 M printer. Biochar was analyzed for its textural properties, thermal stability, and surface morphology. The as-prepared polymer composite was studied for its thermal, mechanical, and dynamic mechanical properties. These results showed that the incorporation of biochar improved the composite mechanical, thermal, and dynamic properties. A 0.5 wt % biochar infusion in PET resulted in a 32% increase in tensile strength. The polymer composite with 5 wt % loading has shown a 60% increase in tensile modulus over neat PET. Moreover, biochar has significantly improved the composite dynamic modulus, dimensional stability, and thermal stability in an oxidative environment.

AB Recently, the 3D-printing approach has received considerable attention in the field of wastewater treatment. This is due to the ability to fabricate adsorbents with fine architectures that are easily recoverable through this technique. Here, the Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets were hybridised with zirconium-based metal-organic framework (UiO-66) through a simple in-situ solvothermal synthesis to develop an efficient adsorbent for organic dye removal. To avoid the secondary pollution of the powdery composite as well as to facilitate the recycling of adsorbent, the 3D-printed MXene/UiO-66 architectures with different lattice geometries of grid, star, and honeycomb were produced. The prepared adsorbent underwent thorough XRD, FTIR, SEM-EDS, TEM, BET, and UV-Vis absorption characterisation. Structural characterisations revealed the successful synthesis of MXene/UiO-66 composite with specific surface area of 347.28 m(2)/g and a large pore volume of 0.26 cm(3)/g, which was uniformly immobilised over and within the 3D-printed architectures with hierarchical porous structures. The 3D-printed MXene/UiO-66 architecture with honeycomb geometry exhibited desired dye removal performance for both the MO (88.95%) and DR31 (76.98%) dyes. The adsorption kinetic was analysed with different kinetic models and it was found that the adsorption followed the pseudo-first-order model. The 3D-printed MXene/UiO-66 architectures also displayed good reusability and stability after four cycles. This work suggests the 3D-printed MXene/UiO-66 architecture as a potential candidate for the removal of organic pollutants from wastewater and environmental protection.

AB The subject of the article is a comparison of new and used powder for 3D metal printing. The powder is 316L stainless steel manufactured by Renishaw. The powder used was taken from the RENISHAW AM250 printer after use. Powder manufacturer Renishaw recommends using 15-45 micron powder in their 3D metal printers. An important parameter of monitoring is the chemical composition of the metal powder and its changes during the thermal treatment during laser sintering. Another important parameter of a metal powder is its mechanical properties, which determine the flowability, consistency and uniformity of powder application. By using an inert atmosphere for sintering and storing the powder, these chemical changes can be prevented, especially against the formation of nitrides and oxides at elevated temperatures.

AB PurposeThe paper describes a proposal for a closed-loop cycle implemented at a 3D printer farm, using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology as an example. The subject of the research was an attempt to assess the susceptibility to segregation and shredding and also to verify the granulometric properties of polymer waste to manage post-consumer objects, shortages and technological waste toward the production of fully valuable filament for reuse from 3D printing technology.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed material management system at the 3D printer farm allows for zero waste management. Management of recycled material is already done at the stage of material selection for a given application and is verified throughout the life cycle, taking into account reprocessing into a new fully functional filament.FindingsThe analysis of particle size and granulometric indices allowed to characterize the milling, the particles of which with their geometric characteristics are different from recyclates processed from waste products, obtained in other thermoplastic processing technologies. The adopted research methods, parameters and indicators allow to characterize the behavior of ground particles of printed parts in the area of secondary processing.Research limitations/implicationsThe research was limited to ABS; however, the methodological solutions described can also be applied to the secondary processing of other materials commonly used in FDM/FFF 3D printing.Practical implicationsThis study demonstrates a methodical approach to the reuse of 3D printing waste. The methods and results presented are practical and may prove useful for reusing both production and post-consumer waste in 3D printing farms.Social implicationsA systematic approach to managing production and post-consumer waste in 3D printing technologies aligns with prevailing social and environmental trends aimed at fully using such waste to reduce the carbon footprint.Originality/valueBased on the work carried out in the secondary management of waste from the printing process, a universal strategy for the management of post-consumer and process waste using thermoplastic filaments primarily ABS has been proposed.

AB To reduce resource consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, 3D printed alkali-activated slag/ fly ash recycled sand (RS) concrete (3DP AARSC) was developed in this paper. The reasonable evaluation of its crack resistance is crucial to structural safety and stability since steel bars are still difficult to embed in 3DP samples automatically so far. The realistic fracture parameters can be responsible for the reasonable evaluation and are extremely difficult to predict accurately based on traditional methods unless the specimen sizes are large enough. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the size-independent tensile strength (ft) and fracture toughness (KIC) through a predictive fracture model incorporating the heterogeneity and discontinuity of 3DP AARSC. First, fracture tests of small-sized specimens were conducted to clarify the fracture mechanisms of 3DP AARSC in different loading directions. Subsequently, based on the boundary effect model, the size-independent ft and KIC were explicitly correlated to the maximum fracture load (Fmax) in different loading directions and directly obtained if Fmax was measured from the tests. The results displayed that the predicted ft and KIC of 3DP AARSC loaded perpendicular to the printing direction were significantly higher than the counterparts of concrete loaded parallel to the printing direction by 108.7% at most. The greatest cracking resistance was demonstrated in the specimens with the RS replacement rate of 60% for natural river sand (NS), resulting in the maximum increase of 19.9% in ft and KIC compared with the 3DP concrete with 100% NS. The fiber addition and partial RS replacement increased the difference in the crack resistance along various loading directions. Moreover, the fiber incorporation had no significant improvement in the crack resistance of 3DP AARSC loaded parallel to the printing direction and apparently increased its ft and KIC along other loading directions.

AB Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is one of the established thermoplastics with inherent piezoelectric characteristics. In the past two decades, a lot of work has been reported on the use of virgin Polyvinylidene fluoride thermoplastics for sensing applications. But hitherto little has been reported on 3D printing of secondary (2 degrees) recycled Polyvinylidene fluoride as a smart energy storage device (ESD). This work is focused on exploring the possibilities for 3D printing of smart energy storage device comprising of Polyvinylidene fluoride having (melt flow index (MFI) 30 g/(10 min) as per ASTM D 1238) reinforced with MnO2 , graphite, ZnCl2, and N H-4 Cl in different weight proportions to form a feedstock filament for fused deposition modeling (FDM) in the first stage. The MFI of Polyvinylidene fluoride composites reinforced with MnO2 , graphite, ZnCl2, and N H-4 Cl (34.095, 8.480, 42.982, 11.807 g/(10 min) respectively) was ascertained for possible 3D printing on FDM. The results suggest that even with an acceptable MFI of prepared 2 degrees recycled Polyvinylidene fluoride, the same was not printable. Further for possible 3D printing on FDM, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) was blended in a Polyvinylidene fluoride matrix, and successful 3D printing-based energy storage device was prepared in the second stage. The study also highlights the mechanical, and morphological properties of Polyvinylidene fluoride composites have been improved after processing with a twin-screw extruder (TSE) by using different input parameters (screw temperature (T), screw speed (S), and load (L)). Overall, the study suggests that the proportion of LDPE, MnO2 , graphite, ZnCl2, and N H-4 Cl has a significant effect on the rheological, mechanical, and morphological properties. The results have been supported with scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis.

AB Due to the large volumes of sediments dredged each year and their classification as waste materials, proper management is needed to efficiently dispose of or recycle them. This study aimed to recycle flash-calcined dredged sediment in the development of an eco-friendly 3D-printable mortar. Mortars with 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30% of flash-calcined sediment were studied. Two tests were carried out to determine the printability of the mixtures. First, a manual gun device was used to examine the extrudability, then a modified minislump test was conducted to assess the buildability and shape-retention ability of the mixtures. Furthermore, the flow table test and the fall cone test were used to evaluate the workability and structural buildup, respectively. The compressive strength was also evaluated at 1, 7, and 28 days for printed and nonprinted mortar specimens. In addition, isothermal calorimetry measurements were conducted on corresponding cement pastes. The results showed that it was possible to print mortars with up to 10% of flash-calcined sediment with the preservation of extrudability and buildability. The results showed that flash-calcined sediment shortened the setting time, decreased the flowability, and enhanced the shape-retention ability. Nonprinted samples with 5% and 10% of flash-calcined sediment showed a similar to higher compressive strength compared to that of the reference mortar. However, printed samples recorded an equal to lower compressive strength than that of nonprinted samples. In addition, no significant change in the hydration process was detected for blended cement pastes compared to the reference cement paste.

AB Shaping room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials into 3D bodies is important for stereoscopic optoelectronic displays but remains challenging due to their poor processability and mechanical properties. Here, konjac glucomannan (KGM) is employed to anchor arylboronic acids with various pi conjugations via a facile B & horbar;O covalent reaction to afford printable inks, using which full-color high-fidelity 3D RTP objects with high mechanical strength can be obtained via direct ink writing-based 3D printing and freeze-drying. The doubly rigid structure supplied by the synergy of hydrogen bonding and B & horbar;O covalent bonding can protect the triplet excitons; thus, the prepared 3D RTP object shows a striking lifetime of 2.14 s. The printed counterparts are successfully used for 3D anti-counterfeiting and can be recycled and reprinted nondestructively by dissolving in water. This success expands the scope of printable 3D luminescent materials, providing an eco-friendly platform for the additive manufacturing of sophisticated 3D RTP architectures.
   An ingenious design strategy is developed to construct sophisticated 3D room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) architectures with high fidelity and mechanical strength via direct ink writing-based 3D printing and freeze-drying. Konjac glucomannan with decent rheological properties can anchor arylboronic acid chromophores with various pi conjugations via B & horbar;O covalent bonds in pure water to afford 3D-printable inks. image

AB In this study, we fabricated a volcanic-shaped 3D solar evaporator for ultrafast solar interfacial evaporation and high-efficient energy utilization by using fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. Benefiting from the multiscale microstructure and polydopamine coating on the evaporation surface, the printed evaporator shows excellent water supply capacity, light utilization, and the Marangoni effect. Adjusting the high/diameter (H/D) ratio of the evaporator can further improve the evaporation performance. Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the optimized 3D evaporation system reaches ultrafast interfacial water evaporation (4.02 kg m2 h1) and efficient energy harvesting (220.34 %). Good water supply and the Marangoni effect endow the evaporator with excellent stability and self-cleaning properties against salt deposition for long-time seawater desalination (3.5 wt % NaCl solution). Meanwhile, the prepared 3D evaporator exhibits huge applied potential in the treatment and recycling of organic wastewater, especially the acid solution (pH =1). The design strategy for the volcanic- shaped 3D evaporator provides novel ideas for developing efficient solar interfacial evaporators

AB Polymer-based product usage rapidly increases globally, leading to severe ecological, social, environmental, health, and economic impacts. There has been an international push for solutions to sustainable production, consumption, and end-of-life for plastics to combat these issues. Moreover, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing (3DP) processes provide rapid fabrication of functional parts in lesser time, lower lead times, and lower research and development costs. Due to these reasons, these processes are now being utilized in different industrial sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, sports, food, electronics, and construction. The circular economy concept integrated with AM processes can deliver a synergic impact and a new life to discarded polymeric parts with distributed recycling and manufacturing. With the development and adoption of the proper techniques, AM can be used widely to reuse polymer wastes to turn them into valuable products. It can lead to much higher levels of reuse at very low cost and for targeted applications. Therefore, in this study, a comprehensive literature review is performed to outline guidelines and a circular economy model for AM of recycled polymers based on the reviewed literature. This study delivers insight into; different commodity polymers and their uses, challenges in polymer recycling, polymer recycling approaches, and a circular economy model for AM of recycled polymers.

ID PERFORMANCE; ELECTRODES; TI3ALC2; MXENE; STATE
AB 2D MXenes represent a useful class of materials in various applications and the main constraint for their bulk production is the requirement of hazardous hydrogen fluoride (HF) as an etching agent. Molten salt synthesis is one of the emerging HF-free techniques to produce MXenes, where a mixture of etching salts is heated till their melting point to etch the MAX phase. Here, we etched Ti3AlC2 MAX using the molten salt synthesis method to obtain 2D Ti3C2Tx, by lowering the typical high reaction temperature (similar to 700 degrees C) to 400 degrees C using oxalic acid as an organic additive, which contributes in reducing the overall melting point of the etching salt mixture. Then, the electrochemical properties of Ti3C2Tx were demonstrated by designing recyclable 3D printed supercapacitors using modified polylactic acid (PLA)/conductive graphene 3D electrodes. A real life application of recyclable 3D printed supercapacitors was demonstrated by powering a digital thermometer. Further, the used supercapacitors were recycled to collect the conductive carbon and constructed a sodium-ion battery using it as a conducting additive of the Ti3C2Tx anode and powered up a glucometer. A zero-waste device with the 'concept 3R' (recycle, recover and reuse) reduces the carbon footprint by keeping the materials out of landfills. Concerning environmental safety and e-waste management, this work establishes a green synthesis of Ti3C2Tx and demonstrates the use of recyclable materials in 3D printed devices for energy storage devices.

AB Recycled fibers like glass, carbon, and basalt are increasingly used in 3D-printed composites due to their high performance and sustainability. This study explores the use of recycled milled carbon fibers (rCFs) as fillers in polyamide-6,6 (PA66) filaments for automotive parts via fused filament fabrication (FFF). Building on prior research, the focus was on analyzing the rheological (melt mass flow rate) and thermal properties (thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, Vicat softening temperature) of PA66 filaments loaded with 5 and 10 wt% rCFs. Results showed that rCFs did not significantly affect the thermal stability of the PA66 matrix, with glass transition temperature and crystallinity remaining constant. A slight increase in melting and crystallization temperatures was observed, attributed to rCFs promoting nucleation and restricting molecular movement. The melt flow rate decreased with increasing rCF content, and the Vicat softening temperature increased by 3 degrees C for 5 wt% rCF and 9 degrees C for 10 wt% rCF. Then, prototypes of automotive shark fin antenna covers were 3D printed, showing good resolution and dimensional accuracy. However, structural defects could be improved by optimizing print parameters. Thermo-mechanical analysis showed no significant changes in thermal stability and transition temperatures. While minimal porosity (<4%) was observed, the Vicat softening temperature of the printed parts dropped by approximately 10 degrees C, still within acceptable limits for automotive applications. Scanning electron microscopy images revealed slight defects such as air pockets and delamination but no fiber clustering.

AB Silicones find use in a myriad of applications from sealants and adhesives to cooking utensils and medical implants. However, state-of-the-art silicone parts fall short in terms of shape complexity and reprocessability. Advances in three-dimensional printing and the discovery of vitrimers have recently opened opportunities for shaping and recycling of silicone objects. Here, we report the 3D printing via direct ink writing of silicone vitrimers into complex-shaped parts with high strength and room-temperature reprocessability. The reprocessing properties of the printed objects result from the adaptive nature of the silicone vitrimer, which can deform under stress without losing its network connectivity. Rheological and mechanical experiments reveal that printable inks can be tuned to generate strong parts with high creep resistance and room-temperature reprocessability, two properties that are usually challenging to reconcile in vitrimers. By combining printability, high strength, and room-temperature reprocessability, the reported silicone vitrimers represent an attractive sustainable alternative to currently available elastomers in a broad range of established and prospective applications.

AB Gelatin is a good biocompatible material. Polyaniline is a polymer compound that can conduct electricity when doped with phytic acid (Ph). However, there are few reports on PANI and gelatin hydrogels. In this paper, a new synthesis method of polyaniline (PANI) was developed, which greatly improved the gas sensitivity while maintaining the excellent quality of PANI. PANI and gelatin were composited into a unified 3D network. ANI synthesized phytic acid-doped PANI and then mixed gelatin with it to make wearable 3D printed sensors. Multilayer structures prepared by 3D printing with PANI ink are free of build-up. A PANI hydrogel sensor was fabricated using a 3D printing method with a stress sensing range of 0-899.8 MPa, a strain sensing range of 0-764.4 % sensitivity GF=1.4, and a TCR=-1.3 for temperature 8.4-29 degrees C. The sensor can accurately detect the motion of large strains in human knee joints and small strains in finger bending. In this study, a simple "green" method was used to convert inexpensive gelatin into a high-performance multifunctional wearable sensor, which can be recycled and provided application prospects for sustainable and environmentally friendly biocompatible materials in the future.

AB Highly efficient and selective adsorption materials for the removal and recycling of U(VI) from radio-active wastewater or seawater are increasingly in demand due to the severe scarcity of strategic uranium sources for nuclear engineering. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical reduced graphene oxide/ethylenediamine scaffold (3D rGOE) was constructed using a direct-ink-writing-based 3D printing method. This technique contained orderly aligned microstructures, good hydrophilicity, mechanical robustness, and a high specific surface area. The optimized 3D rGOE structure obtained by multiscale and rational chemical modification exhibited a significantly higher U(VI) adsorption capacity (908 mg/g at pH = 5.8) compared to other previously reported amino/graphene-oxide-based composites. Additionally, the 3D rGOE mostly retained its high adsorption capacity (decay rate < 3.8%) after 11 cyclical adsorption processes. The adsorbed U(VI) could be eluted in acid through a protonation mechanism, allowing for further enrichment and recovery of U(VI). Characterization and simulations demonstrated that the U(VI) adsorption behaviors of 3D rGOE were due to the synergistic effects of electrostatic adsorption between uranyl ions and oxygen functional groups and the chelation between uranyl ions and amino functional groups. Thus, 3D rGOE shows promise for U(VI) recovery applications because of its high selectivity and adsorption capacity for uranyl ions due to its optimized microstructure and chemical composition.

AB Three-dimensional printing (3DP) technologies are characterized as a set of innovative manufacturing techniques that allow for the creation of complex and/or personalized three-dimensional physical objects on the work surface of a 3D printing machine (based on the computer-aided design (CAD) project designs of these parts). Three-dimensional printing techniques are widely used in various areas of knowledge, such as education, engineering, and biomedicine. Polymeric materials are widely used for these applications, mainly due to their desirable workability during part manufacturing, compatibility with other chemical materials, the wide range of polymers with different physical and chemical characteristics, and the possibility for recycling. The development of polymeric drug delivery systems (DDSs) by 3D printing is currently an active field of research, both in academia and industry, given the potential of this technique for medical purposes. In this context, this work reviews potential polymers for the production of drug delivery systems via 3D printing techniques. The demonstrations of the main 3DP techniques used for drug delivery applications include their working principles and advantages and how the technologies develop the final product. In addition, potential synthetic and natural polymers that are currently used in 3DP drug delivery devices are presented and discussed based on recent scientific studies.

AB Increasing environmental concerns and the need for sustainable materials have driven a focus towards the utilization of recycled polylactic acid (PLA) in additive manufacturing as PLA offers advantages over other thermoplastics, including biodegradability, ease of processing, and a lower environmental impact during production. This study explores the optimization of the mechanical properties of recycled PLA parts through a combination of experimental and machine learning approaches. A series of experiments were conducted to investigate the impact of various processing parameters, such as layer thickness and infill density, as well as annealing conditions, on the mechanical properties of recycled PLA parts. Machine learning algorithms have proven the possibility to predict tensile behavior with an average error of 6.059%. The results demonstrate that specific combinations of processing parameters and post-treatment annealing differently improve the mechanical properties (with 7.31% in ultimate tensile strength (UTS), 0.28% in Young's modulus, and 3.68% in elongation) and crystallinity (with 22.33%) of recycled PLA according to XRD analysis, making it a viable alternative to virgin PLA in various applications such as sustainable packaging solutions, including biodegradable containers, clamshell packaging, and protective inserts. The optimized recycled PLA parts exhibited mechanical properties and crystallinity levels comparable to those of their virgin counterparts, highlighting their potential for reducing environmental impact and saving costs. For both as-built and annealed samples, the optimal settings for achieving high composite desirability involved a 0.2 mm layer thickness, with 75% infill for the as-built samples and 100% infill for the annealed samples. This study provides a comprehensive framework for optimizing recycled PLA in additive manufacturing, contributing to the advancement of sustainable material engineering and the circular economy.

AB 3D printing in construction presents numerous advantages, such as geometric flexibility, potential cost and time savings, the incorporation of recycled and sustainable materials, and reduced waste, thereby reducing the construction sector's environmental impact. Despite these advantages, the widespread adoption of AM in construction faces hurdles, primarily due to the prohibitive costs of large-scale concrete printers typically ranging from $180,000 to over $1 million and technological constraints that impede research and development efforts within the construction sector. To address these challenges, our study focuses on designing, developing, calibrating and evaluating an affordable lab-scale 3D printer specifically tailored for cement-based materials, aiming to lower the entry barrier for AM research in construction. This paper presents a proof-of-concept for a simple, yet functional printing technology that meet the requirements for research studies. The study details the development process, from the conceptual design to the calibration of printing parameters. The development process included the assessment of preliminary extrusion system designs integrated with the motion systems of a fused deposition modeling 3D printer. Subsequently, material studies were carried out to determine optimal material mix compositions and ratios. A comprehensive calibration of printing parameters using statistical analysis was proposed to ensure consistent and quality printing. The printability and applicability of the proposed small-scale 3D printer were assessed by printing samples and testing their thermal properties. Cost analysis showed that the proposed 3D printer, costing $273, offers benefits compared to existing market alternatives. The study illustrates the potential of small-scale 3D printers to facilitate construction research and practices, thereby promoting the development of sustainable construction methods.

AB The abundance of the waste materials of wood and plastic inspired the authors to explore the possibility of 3D printing the recycled materials as composite beams. This paper addresses the design, fabrication, and structural testing of 3D printed composite beams under 3-point bending. The authors believe that 3D printing of beams from timber waste and Polylactic Acid (PLA) is a state-of-the-art and has excellent potential to be transformed to state-of-the-practice in the construction industry. Beams with different compositions of materials and printing densities were designed, printed and tested to failure. This paper elaborates details of the design and printing of the beams, which then will be followed by detailed discussions as to how each beam reacts under flexural loading in terms of deformability, stiffness, strength-to-mass ratio, failure, and load-carrying capacity. General deformations of the specimens implied that the design of the specimens was quite successful in avoiding any premature failure. Large deflections of all specimens indicated that the shear strengthening performed effectively as the shear-vulnerable areas were not affected by the shear failure. The infill density affects the flexural capacity, which is obviously due to the amount of material present against loading. The capacity of the specimens with PLA at the top and bottom sections of the beams was higher than the equivalent beams with timber flanges. Overall, very promising results were obtained with a view to extending the idea into more advanced elements and techniques to develop various 3D printed structural elements towards the ongoing discussion on automation in the construction and prefabrication.

AB Plastic today is commonplace. Products and parts made with plastic have short life cycles, ending up in landfills not long after manufacture. Finding new pathways for plastic waste has become a critical focus of sustainability efforts, especially within manufacturing. Thus, research in this field continues to grow in order to determine the feasibility of reclaiming post-consumer plastic for reuse. This paper evaluates the potential for a sustainable, circular pathway for end-of-life plastic material using 3D-printing techniques. To do this, the work investigates two prevalent industrial 3D-printing technologies: selective laser sintering (SLS) and fused deposition modeling (FDM) of polymers. Material-flow and economic models are developed to outline how plastic parts at the end of their life cycle can be processed and reused. Prior works on fundamental material degradation are integrated into mathematical models of cost and operation. This enables mapping of how multiple reuse cycles affect two prevalent industrial polymers: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polyamide 12 (PA 12). The mapping identifies there is significant opportunity for improving both SLS and FDM 3D-printing technologies when it comes to economic viability and sustainability. Comparison between reuse of FDM using ABS and SLS using PA 12 shows the former costs 82% less than the latter, while also producing 87% less waste than it. While the study established that available industrial 3D-printing technologies can help to reduce plastic waste within manufacturing, a fully circular economy demands materials with less thermal degradation than the primary industrial 3D-printing polymers.

AB The high cement content in 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) presents challenges for achieving a low carbon footprint. Substituting a portion of cement with recycled brick powder (RBP) is a crucial strategy for reducing carbon emissions while enhancing fresh and hardened properties of 3DPC. Balancing RBP preparation energy consumption with its impact on 3DPC performance is crucial for efficient, low-carbon RBP utilization. Two types of RBP were obtained through crushing, sieving (RBP-S, more low-carbon), and grinding (RBP-G). RBP-G with finer particles can enhance the green strength evolution by expediting the initiation of the hydration acceleration period and increase heat flow of this period. 3DPC containing 40 % RBP-G exhibits the lowest porosity, with a rise in gel pores and a drop in macro-pores attributed to the filling effect and pozzolanic activity. RBP-S exhibits a better internal curing effect. Replacing 40 % of cement with RBP-S or RBP-G can reduce drying shrinkage of 3DPC by 30 %. RBP-G excels in enhancing the mechanical properties of 3DPC, whereas RBP-S demonstrates superior performance in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This study presents novel viewpoints on leveraging RBP for low-carbon applications and optimizing the performance of 3DPC.

AB Commonly used 3D printing polymers, such as nylon and polylactic acid (PLA), can experience significant material degradation when exposed to moisture and high temperatures for extended periods. Understanding the extent of their degradation is critical to their long term use and can also inform end-of-life strategies, such as recycling or recovery. Specimens of nylon, carbon fiber-reinforced nylon composite, and PLA, three popular 3D printing materials, were 3D printed and immersed in deionized water at 21 degrees C and 70 degrees C to evaluate the effect of moisture and temperature on their mechanical and chemical properties. Water absorption rates were much higher at elevated temperatures and, at both temperatures investigated, the nylon-based materials absorbed up to 10 times more water than PLA. A direct relationship between moisture absorption and reduction in flexural properties was observed for the nylon-based specimens, with the flexural modulus of nylon decreasing by as much as 60% after 7 days of immersion. PLA, however, displayed negligible mechanical property degradation after immersion at 21 degrees C, but showed substantial physical degradation after being immersed in water at 70 degrees C for 7 days. Analogous changes in chemical structure and crystallinity were observed via Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry.

AB Photocurable 3D printing (SLA or DLP) materials have garnered considerable attention due to their remarkable efficiency and precision in manufacturing. However, the presence of covalent crosslinking makes the recycling and reuse of printed materials extremely challenging. Here a novel approach to covalent crosslinker-free photo-curing 3D printing (via DLP) of liquid metal (LM) composite hydrogels is reported, leveraging surface-initiated photoinduced atom radical transfer polymerization (SI-photoATRP). The pre-synthesized PHEA-Br macroinitiators are grafted onto the surfaces of LM nanoparticles (LMNPs) by mechanical sonication, stabilizing the LMNPs within the resin solution while simultaneously generating active sites for SI-photoATRP. During the SI-photoATRP process, polymer chains of sufficient length form hydrogen bonds with multiple LMNPs, effectively transforming the LMNPs into crosslinking points. By integrating the aqueous photoATRP system catalyzed by carbon dots, LM@polymer composite hydrogel with complex structures are successfully established through DLP technology. The versatility of the 3D printed hydrogel is investigated by employing HEA, OEGA480, and AAm as the monomers in resin solution, respectively. Notably, all the LM@polymer composite hydrogels can be degraded in aqueous NaOH solution. Furthermore, LM@polymer-based networks exhibit self-repairing capabilities, serve as underwater adhesives, and conduct electricity. This work offers new insights into designing 3D printing materials and sustainable photocurable technology.

AB As a potential bio-derived replacement for restricted petrochemicals, isosorbide has emerged as an attractive renewable feedstock for high-performance materials. However, previously reported isosorbide-based polymers rarely offer desired mechanical properties for engineering applications and high materials utilization rate in manufacturing process. Here, we synthesize isosorbide-based polyaryletherketone (PIEK) via nucleophilic substitution poly-condensation reaction and reproduce it at a kg-scale production. Also, isosorbide can be copolymerized with petroleum-based monomers to obtain copolymers (PIEKs) with adjustable properties. PIEKs are melt/solvent-processible for manufacturing and recycling, and we fabricate PIEKs samples via hightemperature printing and low-temperature printing respectively to maximize materials utilization. 3D printing is an inherently waste-free method for accessing products of varying complexity, which is in accord with the concept of environmental protection. 3D-printed PIEKs objects present superior mechanical properties and biocompatibility simultaneously, which are ideal candidates for applications in engineering and health fields such as bone tissue engineering. This work not only develops ideal high-performance bio-based polymers for environmental sustainability, but provides advanced manufacturing technologies to achieve 100% materials utilization rate, which opens up applications in both health and environmental fields.

AB The extrusion system is an integral part of any fused deposition style 3D printing technique. However, the extruder designs found in commercial and hobbyist printers are mostly suitable for materials in filament form. While printing with a filament is not a problem per se, the printing of materials that may not be readily available in the filament form or not commercially viable remains untapped, e.g., biopolymers and material blends. This is particularly an issue in the research and hobbyist space where the capability of printing a variety of materials or materials recycled from already printed parts may be of utmost importance. This paper presents a pellet-based extrusion system for the 3D printing of biopolymers. The system has been designed from the first principles and therefore can be extended to other materials with parameter adjustments or slight hardware modifications. A robust mechatronic design has been realized using an unconventional yet simplistic approach. The extrusion system uses a series of control factors to generate a consistent output of material over the course of a print. The platform and surrounding processes are set up so that software can be used to define the printing parameters; this allows a simpler adaption to different materials. The utility of the extruder is demonstrated through extensive printing and testing of the printed parts.

AB Beer bagasse is a residue waste produced in great amounts; nevertheless, it is still underestimated in the industry. The aim of this paper is to develop an innovative and efficient methodology to recycle the beer bagasse by producing Poly-lactic acid(PLA)-based bio-composites, in the forms of pellets and filaments, to be used in additive manufacturing processes. To assess the suitability of beer bagasse for extrusion-based 3D printing techniques, it was, firstly, physically and chemically characterized. Then, it was added in combination with different kinds of plasticizers to PLA to make bio-composites, analyzing their thermal and physical properties. The results prove the great potential of bagasse, evidencing its printability. Both composites' pellets and filaments were used in two different 3D printing machines and the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed models were evaluated as a function of the composition and the kind of technology used. All the used plasticizers improved processability and the polymer-bagasse interface. Compared to neat PLA, no changes in thermal properties were detected, but a lowering of the mechanical properties of the 3D-printed composites compared to the neat polymers was observed. Finally, a comparison between the efficiency of the two 3D printing techniques to be used with the bio-based composites was performed.

AB Enhancing mechanical properties of environmentally friendly and renewable polymers by the introduction of natural fibers not only paves the way for developing sustainable composites but also enables new opportunities in advanced additive manufacturing (AM). In this paper, wood fibers, as a versatile renewable resource of cellulose, are integrated within bio-based polylactic acid (PLA) polymer for the development and 3D printing of sustainable and recycle green composites using fused deposition modeling (FDM) technology. The 3D-printed composites are comprehensively characterized to understand critical materials properties, including density, porosity, microstructures, tensile modulus, and ultimate strength. Non-contact digital image correlation (DIC) technology is employed to understand local stress and strain concentration during mechanical testing. The validated FDB-based AM process is employed to print honeycombs, woven bowls, and frame bins to demonstrate the manufacturing capability. The performance of 3D-printed honeycombs is tested under compressive loads with DIC to fully evaluate the mechanical performance and failure mechanism of ultra-light honeycomb structures. The research outcomes can be used to guide the design and optimization of AM-processed composite structures in a broad range of engineering applications.

AB The wind energy industry is one of the fastest-growing application sectors of composites, where reinforcement fibers are used in the manufacturing of light rotor blades. Considering the limited lifetime of turbine blades, a growing number of wind turbines will start to be decommissioned. Turbine blades are generally landfilled at their end-of-life, which highly impacts the environment. This paper proposes a systematic scheme combining mechanical recycling and 3D printing to recycle the valuable constituents of the scrap blades and reuse them in a Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process with the aim of improving the mechanical performance of 3D printed components. Mechanical grinding integrated with a double sieving mechanism is utilized to recover the reinforcement fibers. Tensile test specimens with 5 wt% fiber content are fabricated from the recycled fibers and plastic pellets and their mechanical properties as well as internal microstructure are investigated. The results demonstrate an improvement of 16% and 10% in the elastic modulus and ultimate strength of the reinforced composite filament as compared to the commercially available pure PLA filament. As well, a Young's modulus of 3.35 GPa was observed for the FFF fabricated samples, which is an 8% increase relative to pure PLA samples.

AB Reducing atmospheric CO2 is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring a sustainable future. The building sector is a major contributor, consuming 40% of global raw materials and accounting for 35% of global energy consumption. As a result, there is a growing demand for more sustainable building materials. Herein, a scalable, energy-efficient, and low-emission approach is presented to convert various waste streams into building materials via carbon mineralization and 3D printing. Calcium ions are extracted from recycled concrete using ammonium salt leaching methods and then reacted with CO2 gas to form high-purity calcium carbonate through mineralization. This calcium carbonate is formulated into a bio-based mineral binder by incorporating kraft lignin as a rheological modifier. The binder is further combined with sawdust to produce printable inks for additive manufacturing. The resulting 3D-printed structures demonstrate robust mechanical properties and modular design potential, making them suitable for non-load-bearing building applications. By integrating CO2 sequestration and renewable materials, this work demonstrates a closed-loop strategy for carbon capture, waste valorization, and digital fabrication, providing a new avenue for decarbonizing the built environment.

AB Purpose
   This paper aims to present the sustainable performance criteria for 3D printing practices, while reporting the primarily computations and lab experimentations. The potential advantages for integrating three-dimensional (3D) printing into house construction are significant in Construction Industry 4.0; these include the capacity for mass customisation of designs and parameters for functional and aesthetic purposes, reduction in construction waste from highly precise material placement and the use of recycled waste products in layer deposition materials. With the ultimate goal of improving construction efficiency and decreasing building costs, applying Strand7 Finite Element Analysis software, a numerical model was designed specifically for 3D printing in a cement mix incorporated with recycled waste product high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and found that construction of an arched truss-like roof was structurally feasible without the need for steel reinforcements.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The research method consists of three key steps: design a prototype of possible structural layouts for the 3DSBP, create 24 laboratory samples using a brittle material to identify operation challenges and analyse the correlation between time and scale size and synthesising the numerical analysis and laboratory observations to develop the evaluation criteria for 3DSBP products. The selected house consists of layouts that resemble existing house such as living room, bed rooms and garages.
   Findings
   Some criteria for sustainable construction using 3DP were developed. The Strand7 model results suggested that under the different load combinations as stated in AS1700, the maximum tensile stress experienced is 1.70 MPa and maximum compressive stress experienced is 3.06 MPa. The cement mix of the house is incorporated with rHDPE, which result in a tensile strength of 3 MPa and compressive strength of 26 MPa. That means the house is structurally feasible without the help of any reinforcements. Investigations had also been performed on comparing a flat and arch and found the maximum tensile stress within a flat roof would cause the concrete to fail. Whereas an arch roof had reduced the maximum tensile stress to an acceptable range for concrete to withstand loadings. Currently, there are a few 3D printing techniques that can be adopted for this purpose, and more advanced technology in the future could eliminate the current limitation on 3D printing and bring forth this idea as a common practice in house construction.
   Originality/value
   This study provides some novel criteria for evaluating a 3D printing performance and discusses challenges of 3D utilisation from design and managerial perspectives. The criteria are relied on maximum utility and minimum impact pillars which can be used by scholars and practitioners to measure their performance. The criteria and the results of the computation and experimentation can be considered as critical benchmarks for future practices.

AB The development of chemically recyclable polymers for sustainable 3D printing is crucial to reducing plastic waste and advancing towards a circular polymer economy. Here, we introduce a new class of polythioenones (PCTE) synthesized via Michael addition-elimination ring-opening polymerization (MAEROP) of cyclic thioenone (CTE) monomers. The designed monomers are straightforward to synthesize, scalable and highly modular, and the resulting polymers display mechanical performance superior to commodity polyolefins such as polyethylene and polypropylene. The material was successfully employed in 3D printing using fused-filament fabrication (FFF), showcasing excellent printability and mechanical recyclability. Notably, PCTE-Ph retains its tensile strength and thermal stability after multiple mechanical recycling cycles. Furthermore, PCTE-Ph can be depolymerized back to its original monomer with a 90% yield, allowing for repolymerization and establishing a successful closed-loop life cycle, making it a sustainable alternative for additive manufacturing applications.

AB This research analyzes the properties and uses of wood-plastic composites (WPCs) fabricated via 3D printing technology. Diverse techniques for creating are explored, highlighting the impact of various wood and plastic combinations on their physical, mechanical, thermal and hygromorphic characteristics. WPCs are materials that integrate the natural and mechanical properties of wood with the resilience and adaptability of plastics. The prospective uses are explored, emphasizing their present and future functions in both consumer and industrial settings. WPCs are sustainable since they enable the utilization of recycled materials, providing environmental advantages, but some challenges in processing and performance of 3D-printed WPCs exist, along with the need for research and development focused on enhancing material qualities and broadening application potential. The review explores methods of combining wood fibers, wood flour and continuous fibers with polymers.

AB Here, we propose a recyclable approach using acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) residues from additive manufacturing in combination with low-cost and accessible graphite flakes as a novel and potential mixture for creating a conductive paste. The graphite particles were successfully incorporated in the recycled thermoplastic composite when solubilized with acetone and the mixture demonstrated greater adherence to different substrates, among which cellulose-based material made possible the construction of a paper-based electrochemical sensor (PES). The morphological, structural, and electrochemical characterizations of the recycled electrode material were demonstrated to be similar to those of the traditional carbon-based surfaces. Faradaic responses based on redox probe activity ([Fe(CN)6]3-/4-) exhibited welldefined peak currents and diffusional mass transfer as a quasi-reversible system (96 +/- 5 mV) with a fast heterogeneous rate constant value of 2 x 10-3 cm s-1. To improve the electrode electrochemical properties, both the PES and the classical 3D-printed electrode surfaces were modified with a combination of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), graphene oxide (GO), and copper. Both electrode surfaces demonstrated the suitable oxidation of nitrite at 0.6 and 0.5 V vs Ag, respectively. The calculated analytical sensitivities for PES and 3D-printed electrodes were 0.005 and 0.002 mu A/(mu mol L-1), respectively. The proposed PES was applied for the indirect amperometric analysis of S-nitroso-cysteine (CysNO) in serum samples via nitrite quantitation, demonstrating a limit of detection of 4.1 mu mol L-1, with statistically similar values when compared to quantitative analysis of the same samples by spectrophotometry (paired t test, 95% confidence limit). The evaluated electroanalytical approach exhibited linear behavior for nitrite in the concentration range between 10 and 125 mu mol L-1, which is suitable for realizing clinical diagnosis involving Parkinson's disease, for example. This proof of concept shows the great promise of this recyclable strategy combining ABS residues and conductive particles in the context of green chemical protocols for constructing disposable sensors.

The purpose of this article is to investigate how current opportunities in this area are being used, including reverse engineering as a part of the concept of the disabled person's hand exoskeleton. There is no doubt that more research is needed for a more complete understanding

But our solution can significantly improve situation concerning influence of the pollution and reuse of the materials. What more potential for harmful secondary changes from exposure to emission from certain additive manufacturing processes may influence further shape of the 3D printing within Industry 4.0 concept.

ID FABRICATION
AB Leaf recycling, a crucial component of urban environmental protection, aims to systematically collect and reuse fallen leaves on streets. At present, fallen leaves are usually cleaned manually by sanitation workers, and environmental protection departments then use special cars to transport fallen leaves to treatment stations for incineration. This not only requires a significant amount of labor and material resources but also causes air pollution and wastes fallen leaves. In this study, a collecting, crushing, and recycling vehicle was designed to solve this problem. The proposed device significantly improves the efficiency of collecting fallen leaves and facilitates their secondary utilization. The design process is described in detail, including the working design of the entire device, static analysis, and transmission system design. The entire vehicle model was 3D printed to verify that the initial design concept satisfies the assembly and production requirements of the device.

AB In attempt to develop a catalytic monolith with simplified recovery and enhanced recyclability, 3D-printing technology has been leveraged. Three Keggin type heteropolyacids, including silicotungstic acid, phosphotungstic acid, and phosphomolybdic acid were immobilized onto acid-treated halloysite to form catalytically active species, which were then applied to 3D-printing resin to form catalytically active inks. The inks were printed via digital light processing technique and the activity of the monoliths was inspected for Knoevenagel reaction. The impacts of various influential parameters, encompassing the nature of Keggin, its loading on halloysite, and the content of halloysite-supported Keggin in 3D-printing ink, were investigated and optimized. The catalyst was highly recyclable and structurally stable upon recycling. It was also confirmed that leaching of silicotungstic acid was highly suppressed. Mechanical stability of the catalyst ensures consistent performance over repeated catalytic cycles, making it suitable for industrial applications where durability and costeffectiveness are a priority. Furthermore, the superior recyclability of the catalyst significantly contributes to sustainable catalysis by reducing waste and minimizing the environmental impacts associated with catalyst replacement. These properties not only support development of green processes, but also offer promising solutions for industrial and environmental applications, strengthening the role of catalyst in advancing sustainable chemical production.

AB The recycled carbon fiber reinforced polymer (rCFRP) based on fused filament fabrication possesses many problems, such as high porosity and poor interlayer bonding. In view of this, an overflow extrusion-annealing process is proposed in this paper, in which rCFRP is prepared by using the extrusion flow higher than the theoretical requirement, and then annealed. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that recycled carbon fiber reinforced Nylon 6 (rCF/PA6) composites with a carbon fiber content of 35.5 wt% were successfully prepared by a developed screw extrusion 3D printer. The pore size distribution and micromorphology of rCF/PA6 composites show that the process can eliminate the inter-bead pores, reduce the total porosity, and effectively promotes the interline and interlayer bonding. Mechanical properties tests reveal that compared with pure PA6, the tensile strength of rCF/PA6 composites prepared by this process is increased by 87.4% (100.41 MPa), and the flexural strength is increased by 71% (150.5 MPa). Therefore, this process has great potential in the preparation of high-performance rCFRP, and is expected to provide a new perspective for the industrial application of 3D printed rCFRP in the future.

AB Oily water treatment is a critical environmental challenge owing to the increasing demand for clean water and water pollution mitigation. Among the various treatment methods, membrane filtration stands out because of its numerous advantages, such as high separation efficiency, consistent water quality, versatility, and scalability. However, conventional treatment methods face notable limitations, such as non-uniform pore sizes, fouling problems, and severe environmental concerns owing to the use of toxic solvents in traditional phase inversion processes. Recent advancements in 3D printing technology offer promising solutions to address these drawbacks. This review investigates the potential of 3D-printed membranes as superior alternatives to conventional oil/water separation methods by comprehensively exploring their related aspects. This review begins by classifying 3D printing methods and examining their applications in 3D-printed water treatment membranes for oil/water separation. The key areas covered include membrane properties and characterization, membrane material selection, membrane fabrication and modification, and membrane design. This review also addresses the sustainability aspects of 3D-printed membranes for oil/water separation, highlighting the use of highly stable, renewable, and green materials, as well as the potential for material reuse and recycling. The challenges associated with the adoption of 3D printing for membrane production were addressed, focusing on material and process limitations, safety and environmental issues, and industrial scalability of the technology. Finally, this review outlines the prospects and future directions of research and innovation in 3D-printed membranes for oil/water separation, providing a comprehensive roadmap for advancing this emerging technology.

AB Continuous flow biocatalysis has been a challenge in the biocatalysis area. To enable flow biocatalysis, enzyme immobilization techniques, as well as support materials, have been studied. Herein, this research employed a 3D printer, mussel-inspired polydopamine (PDA), and an enzyme to create PDA-coated 3D-printed bioreactors for continuous flow biocatalysis. Both batch and microfluidic bioreactors were fabricated using a 3D printer, functionalized by PDA, glutaraldehyde, and polyethylenimine, and thereby used for enzyme immobilization. This research used a novel and robust alcohol dehydrogenase, an acetophenone reductase from Geotrichum candidum (GcAPRD), as an enzyme model. First, we succeeded in immobilizing GcAPRD on the PDA-coated 3D-printed batch bioreactors. The immobilized GcAPRD could be recycled up to 4 times to reduce acetophenone with excellent enantioselectivity (ee > 99%, S). Next, continuous flow processes were successfully established using the PDA-coated 3D-printed microfluidic bioreactors with immobilized GcAPRD. The reduction of acetophenone proceeded smoothly to produce an enantiopure alcohol, (S)-1-phenylethanol, with excellent enantioselectivity up to 117-144 h. These findings opened up a new step in flow biocatalysis development, which has the feasibility of scaling up for further industrial uses.

AB Recycling raw iron oxide mill scale formed on steel slabs during the hot rolling process is one way to reduce operating costs and increase steel mill revenue. This research utilized hot rolling mill by-products to fabricate low-cost sustainable raw material for use in 3D printing technology. Mill scale was recycled as iron oxide powder and used to reinforce 3D-printed acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) matrix composite filaments. Prepared mill scale powder was added to ABS composite filament at up to 1.0 vol% mill scale. Homogeneous fine mill scale particle dispersion in the ABS matrix was validated by 3D-reconstructed images of the cross-sectional composite filament by X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT). Moreover, the obtained images were further used to generate a finite element (FE) model for describing local stress distributions around the mill scale particles in the ABS matrix and predicted stress-strain curves were compared with the experimental results. High mechanical and thermal properties and printability of mill scale strengthened ABS composite were found for both as-filament and as-printed conditions. The thermal properties and stability of the polymer matrix composite (PMC) filament were similar to pure ABS. Tensile strength and impact absorbed energy of printed ABS composites increased when adding 1.0 vol% mill scale, in which a 45% increase of tensile strength could be reached.

AB Four isosorbide-based photocurable resins were designed to reveal correlations between the composition and chemical structure, digital light processing (DLP) three-dimensional (3D) printability, thermoset properties, and recyclability. Especially, the role of functional groups, i.e., the concentration of ester groups vs the combination of ester and imine functionalities, in the recyclability of the resins was investigated. The resins consisted of methacrylated isosorbide alone or in combination with methacrylated vanillin or a flexible methacrylated vanillin Schiff-base. The composition of the resins significantly affected their 3D printability as well as the physical and chemical properties of the resulting thermosets. The results indicated the potential of methacrylated isosorbide to confer rigidity to thermosets with some negative effects on the printing quality and solvent-resistance properties. An increase in the methacrylated vanillin concentration in the resin enabled us to overcome these drawbacks, leading, however, to thermosets with lower thermal stability. The replacement of methacrylated vanillin with the methacrylated Schiff-base resin decreased the rigidity of the networks, ensuring, on the other hand, improved solvent-resistance properties. The results highlighted an almost complete preservation of the elastic modulus after the reprocessing or chemical recycling of the ester-imine thermosets, thanks to the presence of two distinct dynamic covalent bonds in the network; however, the concentration of the ester functions in the ester thermosets played a significant role in the success of the chemical recycling procedure.

AB Persistent architectural interest in material recycling and biodegradability is driving the utilization of living materials in construction. In this study, the authors explored the use of natural powder-mixed bioprintable hydrogels for cold-processing, robot-assisted extrusion additive manufacturing (EAM). We sought to develop a building-scale bio-composite ink capable of rapid gelation, vertical stacking, and minimal dry shrinkage for large 3D printing. Assorted combinations of natural polymeric and organic powders were empirically compounded to evaluate their extrudability and shape durability. The research revealed that a hydrogel construct consisting of xanthan gum, chlorella, cellulose, eggshell, and charcoal exhibited optimal performance, attributed to the composition's ability to enhance flowability while maintaining structural strength. Utilizing this ink, architectural designs were prototyped to showcase real-scale feasibility. Mechanical testing demonstrated that the architectural form of the bio-sourced mixture performed comparably to traditional materials, indicating its viability for future 3D printing in building construction.

AB The main objective of this research is to identify optimal printing strategies and PLA (polylactic acid) filament materials to produce rapid prototype deep drawing tools. Additive 3D printing technologies have been applied for a long time to produce tools, but the research is unique in that it uses conventional and various reinforced PLA materials with conventional FDM (Fused Deposition Modeling) printers. The advantage of this method is that PLA is easy to print and recycle and does not require expensive or special printers, this also gives the article its novelty. A further aim was to produce the tools using commercially available low-end printers. DX53D 0.8 mm thick body steel and AlMg3 2.5 mm thick sheet were the materials to be molded for the tests. The test tool was an Erichsen deep drawing punch. Tool wear was tested using the GOM ATOS measuring system, an optical coordinate measuring machine based on the DIC (Digital Image Correlation) principle, which is also popular in the automotive industry. The study aims to determine the 3D printing and material parameters that can safely produce a minimum batch of 100 parts.

AB Recent progress in circular 3D-printable photocurable resins that enable closed-loop recycling marks a significant step forward in reducing wasteful manufacturing methods and non-recyclable printed plastics. However, with 3D printing technologies shifting from prototyping to full-scale production, the demand for high-scale processes and easily tuneable resin compositions can benefit from the design of automated systems. Herein, we report on the on-demand preparation of a circular 3D-printable resin, achieved through a continuous flow approach. A supported enzyme (Lipase B from Candida antarctica) was used to promote a green esterification of the lipoic acid with biobased alcohols to prepare circular biobased photocurable resins. The supported enzyme was employed for the preparation of a packed bed reactor and was easily recycled and reused to achieve the continuous production of lipoate-based photocurable resins with tuneable composition. Lastly, the environmental impact of the developed on-demand manufacturing process was compared to the previously reported esterification protocols through life cycle assessment, showing the effectiveness of continuous enzymatic flow synthesis in enhancing environmental performance across multiple areas, from human health to ecosystem impact and resources.

AB For the first time, integration of 3D printing technology was used to develop ternary nanocomposites (WO3-UiO66@rGO) as reusable photocatalytic materials to investigate the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX), an antibiotic pollutant from the wastewater sources. The materials fabricated were characterized for highlighting the synergistic impact of tungsten trioxide (WO3), UiO-66, and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to boost the photocatalytic efficiency. The WO3-UiO-66@rGO materials were prepared by solvothermal method and tested for N2 adsorption, field emission-scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mapping, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), UV-Vis diffuse reflectance, photoluminescence (PL), Fouriertransform infrared (FTIR), and Raman spectroscopy. Digital light processed (DLP) 3D printing demonstrated the complex composite structures with strong mechanical strength and recycling ability. As the 3D-WO3-UiO66@rGO was tested for 10 cycles of SMX degradation with a recovery of 100 % of its photocatalytic activity, and its reusability was also evaluated. During the first 60 min, the 3D printed catalysts demonstrated a high degrading efficiency towards SMX, with a kinetic reaction constant of 0.02955 min-1. This is 6.2 times greater than that of WO3 catalyst and 1.8-times higher than that of WO3-UiO-66@rGO. The nanocomposites exhibited photocatalytic degradation of SMX over that of pristine WO3, suggesting the potential of 3D-printed nanocomposites as sustainable and efficient catalysts for wastewater treatment for the removal of persistent pharmaceutical pollutants, thus meeting the sustainable development goals of Clean Water and Sanitation (Goal 6).

AB In the past decade, the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) based composites processed by fused filament fabrication (FFF) and gel-printing routes have been widely used in various applications such as consumer products, pressure sensing, biomedical scaffolds, etc. But hitherto, little has been reported on the fabrication of hybrid 3D-printed functional prototypes involving FFF and gel-printing processes. This study reports investigations on hybrid (gel+FFF) 3D-printed functional prototypes of primary (1 degrees) recycled PVDF for biomedical scaffolding applications. The comparison of the functional prototypes based on mechanical (tensile), thermal (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)), bond characteristics (Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)), dielectric constant (epsilon r), morphological properties (scanning electron microscopy (SEM), surface roughness (Ra), amplitude distribution function (ADF), bearing ratio curve (BRC), peak count (PC), and 3D rendered image), and voltage-current (V-I) analysis has been presented. The results obtained for mechanical properties outlined that the hybrid 3D printed PVDF-based functional prototypes have an acceptable Young's modulus (E) of 338.48 +/- 2.10 MPa. Also, the DSC, TGA, FTIR, and dielectric behaviour analysis indicated comparatively good thermal properties (heat capacity of 14.58 J/g and stable thermal degradation with 29.25 % residue), epsilon r of 2.91 in the hybrid printed functional prototypes.

AB Composite filaments with differing harakeke, hemp fibre or recycled gypsum contents (0-50 wt%) in pre-consumer recycled polypropylene (PP) were produced and mechanically assessed. Furthermore, a novel method of measuring shrinkage in 3D printed components was also developed and used to assess shrinkage of filaments. The most successful filaments contained 30 wt% harakeke fibre and had a tensile strength and Young's modulus of 39 MPa and 2.8 GPa respectively, providing improvements in tensile strength and Young's modulus compared to those of plain PP filament of 74% and 214% respectively. However, these properties were seen to reduce on printing, although fibre reinforcement was still observed to provide benefit in terms of strength and shrinkage. The cause of the mechanical property reduction was assumed to be stress relaxation of the polymer during printing which is conducted at lower pressure compared to filament production. 30 wt% harakeke filament also underwent the least shrinkage of 0.34% corresponding to a net reduction of 84% relative to plain PP.

AB This paper investigates the evolution of recycled fibres and their influence on the mechanical property loss in material extrusion additive manufacturing of discontinuous carbon fibre reinforced polyamide-6 thermoplastic composites. For the first time, recycled carbon fibres in a broad range of 100 mu m - 2.8 mm lengths with a consistent fraction of 20 wt% were produced in composite flakes as feedstock with specific sizes, which were screw-extruded into filament for material extrusion additive manufacturing. Comprehensive characterisations were carried out to trace the evolution of material microstructure throughout the recycling and manufacturing processes. The void content, fibre orientation, fibre length and its breakage were analysed. Tensile tests show that the printed composites with the longest fibre length of 433 mu m have the highest tensile strength of 126 MPa and tensile modulus of 6.4 GPa, which are 37% and 63.2% higher than the sample with a conventional 0.1 mm length of milled fibres. Specifically, it was found that the fibre length in 1.4 mm flakes was reduced to 750 mu m by screw-extrusion (with customised auger teeth and extruder nozzle) and further reduced to 324 mu m by material extrusion (with a nozzle diameter of 1 mm). It has been experimentally identified that the tensile strength of the current 3D printed composites using the initial fibre length of 1.4 mm in coupon can be further increased by more than 55.6% if properly reducing the air voids, fibre breakage and improving the fibre orientation.

AB The disposal/recycling of plastic materials are one of the biggest challenges of 21st century. Some studies have been reported in recent past on recycling of thermoplastics via three-dimensional (3D) printing as a novel technique under primary and secondary recycling. But hitherto no work has been reported on use of recycled/virgin thermoplastics for use as energy storage devices (ESD). In this paper an effort has been made to develop in house ESD in form of dry cell by printing with low cost fused deposition modeling (FDM) based commercial open source 3D printer. The feed stock filament of FDM has been prepared by twin screw extrusion (TSE) comprising of advanced composite materials (thermoplastic: acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) matrix, reinforced with different proportions of chemicals/salts namely: MnO2, ZnCl2, NH4Cl and graphite), which has been used to print dry cell for energy storage applications. The commercial dry cell consists of four zones/sections and feed stock filaments for three zones have been prepared separately on TSE (with different proportions of ABS and reinforcement of chemical/salts) and fourth zone (of Zn metal) has been tasted with conventional sand casting route. Finally, all four zones have been assembled in series to develop fully functional prototype of ESD. This study highlights that with the proposed methodology, dry cell comprising of minimum 40% by weight recycled thermoplastics can be prepared successfully having voltage potential at par with commercial dry cell. Another major advantage of using this novel route is that the ESD prepared is more thermally stable (confirmed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis) and can operate up to 95 degrees C temperature. Along with this the ESD so prepared has better rheological, mechanical properties (tensile, surface hardness) ensuring it to be useable under severe loading conditions. The results are also supported by photomicrographs.

The polyethyleneterephthalate samples were arranged according to their glass transition and melting points, which made it possible to correlate the samples according to the degree of crystallinity. In order to obtain a filament based on the dust waste from the solid-phase polycondensation process an extrusion temperature regime was established, and samples of filaments for 3D printing that meet the requirements of GOST R 59100-2020 were obtained.

AB Additive manufacturing allows wide design freedom and manufacturing of complex parts. For the medical sciences, the fabrication of realistic and patient-specific 3D replica of organs offers exciting opportunities. Organ replicas allow better training, e.g. in endoscopy, open more avenues for medical research and can reduce the need for animal testing. However, the use of plastics for 3D printing inherently produces waste and needs to be considered with respect to a circular economy.
   With the example of the upper half of a stomach replica for endoscopy, we showcase the feasibility of using recycled versus new polylactic acid (PLA) versus algae-based PLA as printing materials in a wire extrusion process. Furthermore, the stomach half replica is manufactured with elastic materials by stereolithography and polyjet binding, with the aim of improving the user experience and making the stomach model properties more realistic. This paper discusses printing energy, part dimensions and surface roughness, material recyclability, and waste in the context of the digital thread to enable more sustainable 3D printing practices for 3D organ replicas and a circular economy. We furthermore address post-processing of the 3D printed parts and usability in the context of medical training and research. This is a small case study which will be expanded in the future.

AB Since the crosslinked natural rubber (NR) products contain chemical crosslinks, the materials have loosened the biodegradable and environmentally friendly properties. Combination of NR and thermoplastic, so called thermoplastic natural rubber (TPNR), can be a proper approach for solving this evident through new technological processing. Therefore, the three-dimensional 3D printing TPNR based on polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) thermoplastics were carried out. Blending ratios of 70:30 and 80:20 have investigated, while the dynamically cured system was applied to the blends. This aims to the NR applications and solves the end-cycled of NR waste which cannot be recycled. Relating the molecular structure of the blends, the crosslinked NR particles are dispersed and distributed in the PP phase, while the superior toughness of HDPE provides high elongation at break and impact strength. However, the high crystallinity of PP combined with its low toughness and high stickiness makes it a more broadly applicable 3D printing material than HDPE. It was found that the complexed 3D printing of PP/NR at 80:20 showed the highest compressive strength relative to pure PP. This indicates the improvement of the intrinsic properties of the blends. This improvement can be advantageous for the NR product platform when it is incorporated in PP and parts are produced by 3D printing.

AB The continuous catalytic oxidation of cytostatic drugs such as mycophenolic acid (MYC) and methotrexate (MTX) solutions using 3D printed sludge-based catalysts in a trickling bed reactor has been investigated. Catalysts derived from modified sludge, treated with additives such as potassium carbonate, showed improvements in both textural properties and efficiency in the degradation of MYC and MTX. 3D printing technology allows for precisely designing and producing structured monolith catalysts. This study highlights the innovative use of 3D-printed sludge-based catalysts to treat hospital wastewater containing MYC and MTX. The catalyst showed a stable stream activity with an average conversion of 95 % for both compounds (T = 100 degrees C, P = 15 bar, Ql = 0.3 ml/min and Qg = 150 ml/min.). This work provides new ways to recycle sewage sludge and make highly efficient monolithic catalysts for continuous hospital wastewater treatment with significant implications for environmental protection and public health.

AB Today, Ni-Cr steel is used for advanced applications in the high-temperature and electrical industries, medical equipment, food industry, agriculture and is applied in food and beverage packaging and kitchenware, automotive or mesh. A study of input steel powder from various stages of the recycling process intended for 3D printing was conducted. In addition to the precise evaluation of the morphology, particle size and composition of the powders used for laser 3D printing, special testing and evaluation of the heat-treated powders were carried out. Heat treatment up to 950 degrees C in an air atmosphere revealed the properties of powders that can appear during laser sintering. The powders in the oxidizing atmosphere change the phase composition and the original FeNiCr stainless steel changes to a two-phase system of Fe3Ni and Cr2O3, as evaluated by X-ray diffraction analysis. Observation of the morphology showed the separation of the oxidic phase in the sense of a brittle shell. The inner part of the powder particle is a porous compact core. The particle size is generally reduced due to the peeling of the oxide shell. This effect can be critical to 3D printing processing, causing defects on the printed parts, as well as reducing the usability of the precursor powder and can also change the properties of the printed part.

AB The aim of this work is to advance the development of an alternative eco-friendly method of manufacturing printed circuit boards (PCBs) using recycled and recyclable 3D printable polymers as the insulating substrate and a special silver paste for the conductive pattern. The components are embedded in the insulating substrate, and the connection to the PCB is made by overprinting the component with the silver paste. To improve mechanical properties and durability, in this work, the conductive pattern was overprinted on the 3D printer with another layer of recycled polymer, completely encapsulating the component. The results showed that the overprinting post-process led to a significant improvement in the mechanical properties of the interconnects with no negative impacts on the contact resistance of the components. The measurements of contact resistance indicated similarity to ECA joints. According to the pull-off test performed on the assembled two-terminal components, the pull-off force required to detach the component was similar to that of the soldered joints. Although the encapsulation did not apparently affect the change of the mechanical and electrical properties after accelerated aging tests, it showed an increase in reliability for rPLA samples. In this case, the encapsulation eliminated cracks in the conductive pattern. Despite the extensive development that still lies ahead, this alternative, environmentally friendly method could then be used in low-cost electronics or prototyping applications where sustainability is a priority.

AB The tedious preparation procedures and difficulty in free structure formation and recycling have restricted the widespread application of existing enzyme immobilization strategies. Here, we report a novel type of enzyme immobilization strategy utilizing additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing). The shape and structures of carbon fiber reinforced polylactic acid (C-PLA) scaffolds could be flexibly designed and printed (cube, sphere, and pyramid shapes and microfluidic reactors). After chemical modification with piranha solution, peracetic acid, and a silane coupling agent, the resultant scaffolds achieved a high specific surface area (2.2 m(2)/g, a 3.63-fold increase) with an abundance of surface-active groups. As a proof of concept, four kinds of enzymes (penicillin G acylase (PGA), protease, glycosidase, and lipase) were successfully immobilized on the chemically modified 3D scaffolds. The final yield was 185.6 mM for the reaction catalyzed by PGA, and the final yield of lactosucrose reached 142 g/L for the glycosidase-catalyzed reaction. After 10 cycles, the retention rate of enzymatic activity was 88% for PGA and 92.8% for glycosidase. Thus, tunable 3D-printed enzyme immobilization carriers offer a promising solution to building a simple platform that is low cost and flexible enough to accommodate various enzymes and reactors for industrial applications.

AB This paper proposes a methodology for the mixture proportioning of 3D printable mortar containing recycled sand (RS), having similar fresh and hardened properties to a reference 3D printable mortar made with natural sand (NS). The methodology is based firstly on a fast and accurate characterization of the water absorption coefficient of the RS and secondly on the volume substitution of the NS by RS. This allows hardly changing the composition of the cement paste, slightly modifying the admixture dosage with a constant Weff/C ratio. The proposed methodology is applied to two different recycled sands. Results at the fresh state show that the structuration rates of recycled mortars are slightly lower than those of the reference mortar due to the slight increase in superplastizer content, but the close obtained values suggest that the Weff/C ratios are very similar in the three mortars. This result is confirmed by the porosity measurement on hardened mortars, which shows that the porosities of the cement pastes of the three mortars are almost identical. The compressive strength of recycled mortars is slightly lower than that of the reference mortar, which can be attributed to the lower intrinsic properties of RS compared to NS. This methodology enables the use of recycled sand as a sustainable alternative to natural sand in 3D printing applications.

The composites' properties were analyzed through dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). X-ray diffractometry (XRD) revealed the amorphous nature of the materials, with VABS exhibiting key peaks at 13.60 and 20.20. DMA results demonstrated that CBW reinforcement significantly enhanced the stiffness and thermal stability of the composites. Sample S5, with the highest brass wire content, achieved the maximum storage modulus (2900.5 MPa) and loss modulus (765.67 MPa), while S3 showed optimal performance in stiffness and damping for product design applications.

AB An effective oil separating technique from water-oil mixture can be used in various industrial fields such as environmental purification and resource recycling. In this study, a vitreous carbon (VC) grid structure was fabricated by carbonization of digital light processing (DLP) 3D (3-dimensional) printed parts, and its oil separation performance was evaluated. A planner DVC grid structure with pore sizes of similar to 200, similar to 430 and similar to 520 mu m was fabricated and its water-oil separation performance werewas evaluated. Despite theoretical calculations suggesting adequate water repelling pressures for pores around similar to 300 and similar to 360 mu m, actual performance fell short due to defects from 3D printing and carbonization processes. A more robust design approach involves fabricating a cuboid shell-shaped VC grid structure with smaller pores (similar to 150 mu m), demonstrating continuous water-oil separation capabilities.

   BEHAVIOR
AB 3D-printed concrete (3DPC) technology based on layer-by-layer stacking has received increasing attention owing to its ability to produce customized formwork-free products. In this study, basalt-derived manufactured sand (MS) was used as a replacement for natural sand in 3DPC mixtures. Tests on printability, green strength at varying curing times, hardened mechanical properties, and characterization of the microstructure were conducted. The results demonstrate that the incorporation of MS into 3DPC produces an increase in fluidity and a reduction in unconfined compressive strength. Incorporation of MS enhanced the flexural strength of 3DPC along the printing direction, that is, the interlayer bonding strength, while decreasing its compressive anisotropy from 0.81 to 0.29. This partially compensates for interlayer defects in 3DPC, thereby benefiting for overall performance improvement of structures.

AB Using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, a 3D calcium alginate/graphene oxide (3D CA/GO) adsorbent, with a hierarchical macroporous structure, was successfully constructed. Owing to the optimized construction process, the 3D CA/GO showed an enhanced adsorption capacity (490.2 mg/g at pH = 3.0) for lead (Pb (II)) in aqueous solution, which was two times higher than reported in the literature). Meanwhile, the selective adsorption ratio of 3D CA/GO for Pb(II) reached 99.8% when positive ions occurred. In addition, after eight adsorption-desorption cycles, the adsorption capacity did not experience a significant decrease and the structure remained stable. Meanwhile, the adsorbed Pb(II) could be eluted by hydrochloric acid. Moreover, through characterization analysis and Ca(II) releasing experiment, we confirmed that the adsorption mechanism of 3D CA/GO consisted of electrostatic interactions, ion exchange and chelation. According to the actual application experimental, the waste water of medical environment was chosen, and the 3D CA/GO was verified as capable of removing and recycling Pb(II). The immersion experiment using simulation wastewater solution containing heavy metal ions also indicated that 3D CA/GO could maintain structural stability and sustain its adsorption capacity. The excellent structural stability, strong adsorption capacity, and outstanding selective adsorption capacity for 3D CA/GO were attributed to the controllable construction and optimized structure of hierarchical macroporous materials by 3D printing technology.

ID HYDROGELS
AB Brewer's spent grain (BSG) is the largest waste generated from the brewing industry, accounting for similar to 39 million tons yearly. Currently, the material has limited use for feeding farm animals and presents minimal market value. There has been a growing interest in the potential recycling of BSG as a manufacturing material. In this study, we are reporting the preparation of a fully bio-based 3D printable biocomposite based on recycled BSG material. The biocomposite is composed of BSG fine particles that are blended with nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) hydrogel. Cross-linking agent glutaraldehyde was used to improve the viscosity of the biocomposite. Our results showed the composite is a paste-like material and adaptable for 3D printing. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and mechanical testing were used to evaluate the surface morphology and mechanical resistance of biocomposite, respectively. A prototype for food spoilage monitoring based on the BSG-NFC biocomposite was demonstrated. It is expected that this fully bio-based composite will be a low-cost, recyclable, and sustainable 3D bio-printing material for biological applications.

AB With the growing emphasis on sustainable construction practices and advancements in 3D printing technology, the integration of by-products into 3D printed concrete (3DPC) has emerged as a significant area of research. While previous studies have examined the use of alternative fine aggregates in 3DPC, there remains a considerable gap in assessing their performance. This review aims to fill that gap by concentrating on the incorporation of alternative materials from four primary sources: industrial by-products (such as used tyres rubber crumb, glass, steel slag, and plastics), mining wastes (including copper, iron, antimony, and bauxite tailings), construction and demolition wastes, and other materials (like seashells and aeoline sand). It investigates how different by-products used as sand substitutes affect the fresh, rheological, mechanical, and microstructural properties of the 3DPC. Furthermore, the review highlights research related to the durability and environmental impact of these modified 3DPC mixes. The findings indicate that certain by-products, such as seashells and recycled aggregates, reduce flowability and extrudability due to their irregular shapes and the formation of air pockets, while copper tailings and recycled glass enhance these properties. The rheological behaviour of the mixtures is influenced by the type of by-products, with recycled plastic increases the viscosity and rubber crumbs improves the binder-particle interactions. The strength characteristics vary; for instance, bauxite tailings and steel slag tend to enhance mechanical performance, whereas recycled plastic decreases the strength. Although data on durability is limited, preliminary results suggest that incorporating by-products can lead to increased porosity but also improved the resistance to carbonation and chloride ion penetration, particularly with materials like bauxite tailings. The review compares the collected experimental data with predictions from various models, indicating the need for more specific design-oriented models to connect the properties of 3DPC using different alternative aggregates. A recommended replacement range for fine aggregates of 20-40 % is suggested to optimize both flowability and strength. This strategy offers substantial sustainability benefits, including reduced waste and conservation of natural resources, positioning it as a promising avenue for sustainable construction practices.

AB In this study, a meat analogue formulation prepared using different protein sources as a printable ink for 3D printers and fortified with three different mushroom cultivars (reishi, Ganoderma lucidum (GL); saffron milk-cap, Lactarius deliciosus (LD); and oyster, Pleurotus ostreatus (PO)). 3D printing performance of the prepared inks was evaluated by factorial design in terms of nozzle height, printing speed, and flow compensation. New methods of maximum layer height and reprintability of plant-based meat analogues were conducted for the first time. Inks were characterized by analyzing rheological properties, microstructure, color characteristics, texture profile, cooking loss, amino acid content, and sensory evaluation. Results showed that the nozzle height and printing speed were found to be most effective on accuracy of prints and smoothness of layers. All inks (C, GL, LD and PO) represented shear-thinning and gel-like viscoelastic behavior (G & PRIME; > G & DPRIME;) with predominant elasticity (tan & delta; < 1). Therefore they were suited for 3D printing and possessed supporting the following layers for additive manufacturing as well as meeting the criteria for a stable structure. Meat analogue was printed successfully without perceived defects in all formulations, except the GL was looking linty. LD and PO inks brought the advantage of recycling as a result of their re-printability whereas GL could not. Moreover, mushroom fortification reduced hardness, stiffness, springiness, and chewiness properties of the meat analogues whereas it increased the juiciness with reasonable overall acceptance. Mushroom fortification also enhanced the nutritional value and improved release of umami amino acids. The findings of the study demonstrated that mushrooms could be a functional and nutritious candidate for 3D printable plant-based meat analogues.

ID PERFORMANCE; COMPOSITES
AB Three-dimensional printed concrete (3DPC) is increasingly recognized in the construction industry for its high design flexibility and the elimination of conventional formwork. However, weak interlayer adhesion remains a significant challenge. The potential of recycled polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers for reinforcing 3DPC is being explored, driven by their environmental sustainability and economic advantages. However, there is an inadequate interfacial adhesion between these recycled fibers and the 3DPC matrix. This study investigated the use of dopamine modification to address this issue and enhance the interlayer adhesion of fiber-reinforced 3DPC. Recycled PET fibers were surface-modified using dopamine treatment, forming a polydopamine (PDA) film that improved surface roughness and hydrophilicity. Both unmodified and modified fibers were incorporated into 3DPC at various volume fractions (0.1%, 0.3%, 0.5%). The effects on interlayer adhesion strength, compressive strength, and flexural strength were systematically evaluated and compared. The results showed that the inclusion of 0.3 vol% dopamine-modified fibers resulted in a 22.5% increase in interlayer adhesion strength compared to the control group, and a 14.8% improvement over unmodified fibers at the same content. Additionally, the compressive strength and flexural strength of 3DPC with 0.3 vol% MPET fibers increased by 22.5% and 27.6%, respectively, compared to the control group. Microstructural analysis using SEM and XRD revealed that the dopamine modification significantly improved the interfacial adhesion between fibers and the concrete matrix, explaining the superior performance of modified fibers. This study demonstrates that recycled PET fibers modified with dopamine can effectively enhance the interlayer adhesion of 3DPC. The findings affirm that surface modification techniques can significantly elevate the utility of recycled PET fibers in 3DPC, contributing to the sustainable advancement of construction materials.

AB Recycling of catalysts is often performed. Additive manufacturing (AM) received increasing attention in recent years in various fields such as engineering and medicine, among others. More recently, the fabrication of three-dimensional objects used as scaffolds in heterogeneous catalysis has shown innumerable advantages, such as easier handling and waste reduction, both leading to a reduction in times and costs. In this work, the fabrication and use of 3D-printed recyclable polylactic acid (PLA) scaffolds coated with an iron oxide active catalyst for Fenton reactions applied to aromatic model molecules, is presented. These molecules are representative of a wider class of intractable organic compounds, often present in industrial wastewater. The 3D-printed PLA-coated scaffolds were also tested using an industrial wastewater, determining the chemical oxygen demand (COD). The catalyst is characterized using electron microscopy coupled to elemental analysis (SEM/EDX) and thermogravimetry, demonstrating that coating leach is very limited, and it can be easily recovered and reused many times.

AB 3D printing is a new emerging technology in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape. Its potential advantages for personalized medicine have been widely explored and commented on in the literature over recent years. More recently, the selective laser sintering (SLS) technique has been investigated for oral drug-delivery applications. Thus, this article reviews the work that has been conducted on SLS 3D printing for the preparation of solid oral forms (SOFs) from 2017 to 2020 and discusses the opportunities and challenges for this state-of-the-art technology in precision medicine. Overall, the 14 research articles reviewed report the use of SLS printers equipped with a blue diode laser (445-450 nm). The review highlights that the printability of pharmaceutical materials, although an important aspect for understanding the sintering process has only been properly explored in one article. The modulation of the porosity of printed materials appears to be the most interesting outcome of this technology for pharmaceutical applications. Generally, SLS shows great potential to improve compliance within fragile populations. The inclusion of "Quality by Design" tools in studies could facilitate the deployment of SLS in clinical practice, particularly where Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) for 3D-printing processes do not currently exist. Nevertheless, drug stability and powder recycling remain particularly challenging in SLS. These hurdles could be overcome by collaboration between pharmaceutical industries and compounding pharmacies.

AB This paper deals with the evolution monitoring of biomass colonization and mechanical properties of 3D printed eco-materials/mortars immersed in the sea. Measurements of tensile strength, compressive strength, and Young's modulus were determined on samples deployed along the Atlantic coast of Europe, in France, United Kingdom, Spain, and Portugal. The samples were manufactured using 3D printing, where six mix designs with a low environmental impact binder were used. These mortars were based on geopolymer and cementitious binders (Cement CEM III), in which sand is replaced by three types of recycled sand, including glass, seashell, and limestone by 30%, 50%, and 100% respectively. The colonization of concrete samples by micro/macro-organisms and their durability were also evaluated after 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months of immersion. The results showed that both biomass colonization and mechanical properties were better with CEM III compared to geopolymer-based compositions. Therefore, the mixed design optimized according to mechanical properties show that the use of CEM III should be preferred over these geopolymer binders in 3D printed concrete for artificial reef applications.

AB With the production of wood waste constantly on the increase, questions relating to its recycling and reuse are becoming unavoidable. The reuse of wood and its derivatives can be achieved through the production of composite materials, using wood as a reinforcement or even as the main matrix of the material. Additive manufacturing (also known as 3D printing) is an emerging and very promising process, particularly with the use of bio-based and renewable materials such as wood or its industrial derivatives. The aim of this paper is to present an overview of additive manufacturing processes using wood as a raw material and including industrial solutions. After presenting wood and its waste products, all the additive manufacturing processes using wood or its industrial derivatives will be presented. Finally, for each 3D printing process, this review will consider the current state of research, the industrial solutions that may exist, as well as the main challenges and issues that still need to be overcome.

TI Robust and Elastic Lunar and Martian Structures from 3D-Printed Regolith
   Inks
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA English
DT Article
ID SOIL; URINE; ACID
AB Here, we present a comprehensive approach for creating robust, elastic, designer Lunar and Martian regolith simulant (LRS and MRS, respectively) architectures using ambient condition, extrusion-based 3D-printing of regolith simulant inks. The LRS and MRS powders are characterized by distinct, highly inhomogeneous morphologies and sizes, where LRS powder particles are highly irregular and jagged and MRS powder particles are rough, but primarily rounded. The inks are synthesized via simple mixing of evaporant, surfactant, and plasticizer solvents, polylactic-co-glycolic acid (30% by solids volume), and regolith simulant powders (70% by solids volume). Both LRS and MRS inks exhibit similar rheological and 3D-printing characteristics, and can be 3D-printed at linear deposition rates of 1-150 mm/s using 300 mu m to 1.4 cm-diameter nozzles. The resulting LRS and MRS 3D-printed materials exhibit similar, but distinct internal and external microstructures and material porosity (similar to 20-40%). These microstructures contribute to the rubber-like quasi-static and cyclic mechanical properties of both materials, with young's moduli ranging from 1.8 to 13.2 MPa and extension to failure exceeding 250% over a range of strain rates (10(-1)-10(2) min(-1)). Finally, we discuss the potential for LRS and MRS ink components to be reclaimed and recycled, as well as be synthesized in resource-limited, extraterrestrial environments.

AB This study aimed to characterize the effect of a glass powder additive on recycled polypropylene (rPP) materials from food packaging to be used as filaments in material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing applications. The composite filaments studied were rPP filaments with glass powder (GP) additive in the 2.5%, 5%, and 10% fractions. As a baseline, the filaments made of pure virgin PP and rPP without additive were used. The filament that has been successfully made is then printed into a tensile test specimen and an impact test to observe its mechanical properties. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization was also carried out to determine the effect of chemical bonding and thermal characterization using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results of FTIR characterization on the sample rPP + 10% do not show a typical peak shift of PP, but give rise to new peaks at wavenumbers of 1000 cm(-1) (Si-O-Na), 890 cm(-1) (Si-H) and 849 cm(-1) (O-Si-O), which indicate the typical peaks of the glass constituent compounds. In the thermal characteristics, the addition of GP shows the improved stability of mass changes to heat and increases the melting temperature of rPP. The ultimate tensile strength and Young's modulus for rPP-based specimens with 10% GP additive showed an increase of 38% and 42% compared to PP specimens. In addition to the improved mechanical strength, the addition of GP also reduces the bending deformation, which can be well controlled, and reduces curvature, which is a problem in semicrystalline polymer-based filaments.

AB This work presents a "cradle-to-gate" Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 3D-printing polymerisable ionic liquids (PILs) using digital light projection (DLP). It is based on primary data from environmental emissions, wastewater, chemical components, and manufacturing of PIL based devices. The results indicate that the printing process does not significantly exacerbate the environmental impacts. However, it is shown that excellent opportunities for further mitigation of the life cycle impacts of PILs can be realised are by practising reagent recovery, which reduces the amount of reagents emitted as waste, and by reduction/recycling of solvents used for cleaning the 3D part. The major impact contributor in the 3D-printing of PILs is the synthesis of the IL monomers. The effective reduction of solvent consumption and recovery significantly improves the impact of the synthetic process. This work focuses on the employment of the 3-butyl-l-vinylimidazolium [BVim] cation, with the non-coordinating and hydrophobic bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonimide [NTf2](-) anion as the counter anion. The polymerisable monomer IL has comparable impact compared to the analogous non-polymerisable 3-butyl-l-methylimidazolium [NTf2]ionic liquid, thus potentially allowing for the more efficient use of the ionic liquid properties by immobilization in solid phases. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that switching the anion from [NTf2]-to dicyanamide [N(CN2)](-) significantly decreases the impacts in all categories evaluated for PIL production. This work represents the first phase toward quantitative LCA data generation for the process of 3D-printing ionic liquids, which will be great support for decision making during design of PIL 3D-printing processes at a laboratory scale.

AB This study examines the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) in 3D-printed composites reinforced with short fibers. A novel analytical approach is introduced rooted in extracting fibers from micro computer tomography images to account for their aspect ratio distribution. Utilizing a novel method based on the inertia tensor of ellipsoids. This method enables the conversion of fibers into equivalent ellipsoids, obtaining their respective aspect ratios. Subsequently, these ellipsoids are incorporated into three effective field methods - the Non-Interaction, the Mori-Tanaka, and the Maxwell methods - to assess the composite's CTE. This methodology is applied to recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) reinforced with recycled short carbon fibers (rcPET) that is used in additive manufacturing for composite parts. The analytical results demonstrate good agreement with experimental data sourced from the open literature.

AB The use of 3D-printed electrodes is reported fabricated from in-house conductive filament composed of a mixture of recycled poly (lactic acid) (rPLA), graphite (Gpt), and carbon black (CB) for fast detection of the abused drug ketamine. Firstly, the performance of these electrodes was evaluated in comparison to 3D-printed electrodes produced employing a commercially available conductive filament. After a simple pretreatment step (mechanical polishing), the new 3D-printed electrodes presented better performance than the electrodes produced from commercial filament in relation to peak-to-peak separation of the redox probe [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- (130 mV and 759 mV, respectively), charge transfer resistance (Rct = 1.04 +/- 0.05 k ohm and 9.62 +/- 0.03 k ohm, respectively), and heterogeneous rate constant (k0 = 7.16 +/- 0.05 x 10-3 cm s-1 and 3.57 +/- 0.03 x 10-3 cm s-1, respectively). Excellent analytical characteristics for the detection of ketamine were achieved, including wide linear range (10 to 250 mu mol L-1), excellent sensitivity (0.024 +/- 0.001 mu A mu mol L-1), low limit of detection (LOD = 0.7 mu mol L-1), and recovery values from 82 to 115% for beverage samples (white and red wines, beer, water, and vodka) spiked with the abused drug ketamine.

AB Additive manufacturing has been of considerable interest for the last 10 years. Cementitious composites have been developed to ensure fast and effective structure printing. To address sustainability and reduce the environmental impact of Portland cement-based composites, geopolymer composites have been developed that can be printed. This brings us to this study's aim, which is to allow the printing of recycled lightweight structures with not only the ability to act as a structural material but also insulation capabilities. This study focuses on mix design development and the mechanical strength, creep, and shrinkage properties of these composites. The results show that foamed 3D-printed fly ash-based geopolymer composites may have reduced compressive strength, but still have sufficient strength to be used as a structural material. Furthermore, their creep and shrinkage strain are lower than those of the composite without foaming agent introduction.

AB Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is one of the well-known 3D printing processes for the preparation of functional prototypes. One of the limitations of DMLS is the reusability/ recyclability of the process consumables (waste metallic powder). In the past, some studies testified to the reusability of waste metallic powder of DMLS to support a circular economy. But hitherto little has been reported on investigations of recycled DMLS powder collected in mixed form (comprising more than one metallic alloy). This study highlights the investigations performed on mixed bio-compatible metallic powder (90% of 17-4 precipitate hardened stainless steel and 10% of Ti-6Al-4 V) collected (as waste) from the institute laboratory. During the pilot run, the samples were 3D printed on DMLS at different energy densities (ED) (66.66, 71.42, 90.67 J/mm3) selected based on the combination of available input parameters (i.e., laser power (LP), scanning speed (SCS), hatch distance (HD), layer thickness (LT), etc.), but all samples failed while printing. For successful 3D printing, the collected waste powder was preprocessed for thermal treatment (leading to chemical decomposition) at two different temperatures (550 degrees C (below recrystallization temperature) and 800 degrees C (above recrystallization temperature)). The preprocessed mixed powder at 550 degrees C was successfully 3D printed with ED 71.42 J/mm3 (attained with LP 120W, SCS 800 mm/s, HD 70 mu m, LT 30 mu m). The printed samples resulted in Young's modulus (E) of 4155 MPa (in tensile) and 211 MPa (in flexural) along with a surface hardness of 335.9 HV at 50N. The in vitro studies outlined a corrosion rate of 0.000411 mm/year for a mixed powder-based functional prototype. Also, the specific wear rate was observed as 0.000036mm3/NM. The outcomes are also braced by scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis.

ID ALUMINUM
AB Recent years have witnessed a growing global interest in 3D concrete printing technology due to its economic and scientific advantages. The application of foamed concrete, renowned for its exceptional thermal and acoustic insulation properties, not only holds economic attractiveness but also aligns seamlessly with the principles of sustainable development. This study explores various solutions related to 3D printing technology in construction, discussing the design, production, and properties of foamed concrete mixtures. The integration of 3D printing and the potential for automating the entire process offers opportunities to boost productivity and reduce construction costs. Furthermore, the utilization of foamed concrete with its commendable insulation properties will enable a reduction in the usage of materials other than concrete (e.g., mineral wool, facade mesh, and polystyrene), significantly facilitating the recycling process during building demolition. This, in turn, will lead to the preservation of nonrenewable natural resources and a decrease in CO2 emissions. Despite the promising results, there have been limited studies focusing on 3D printing with foamed materials, whereas a survey of the existing body of literature indicates a notable absence of endeavors pertaining to the utilization of aerated concrete within the realm of 3D printing, especially geopolymer composites (GP) and hybrid geopolymer composites (HGP). The outcomes delineated in the ensuing discourse are demonstrative for conventionally used materials rather than the additive manufacturing variant. Hence, this work aims to systematically review existing practices and techniques related to producing foamed concrete with 3D printing technology. This analysis also contributes to the establishment of a foundational framework and furnishes a preliminary basis upon which future endeavors aimed at the 3D printing of aerated concrete can be embarked. The findings from the literature analysis justify the desirability of continuing research on this topic, particularly when considering the potential for large-scale industrial implementation. This article provides a comprehensive state of the knowledge on the development of 3D printing techniques for foamed concrete mixtures. By consolidating and analyzing findings from different studies, this article offers insights into the advancements, challenges, and potential applications of foamed concrete in additive manufacturing processes. This, in turn, contributes to the overall understanding and advancement of 3D printing technologies using foamed concrete as a versatile and sustainable construction material. The encouraging results obtained from the analysis further underscore the need for the continued exploration of 3D printing, especially with an eye towards its industrial-scale implementation.

AB This study investigates the printability of one-part brick powder-based alkali-activated materials (AAMs) containing end-of-life brick particles as aggregate. The novel formulation showcases promise for 3D printing of small to medium-sized building blocks, reminiscent of a Lego-type system, capitalising on the rapid setting time inherent to one-part AAMs. The effect of replacing up to 50% by weight of natural aggregate with brick aggregate on the fresh properties of brick powder-based alkali-activated materials, including slump measurements, flowability, setting time, open time and green strength were investigated. In addition, the flexural and compressive strength of the 3D printed mixtures were determined and compared to those of cast specimens. The buildability and microstructure were also examined. The results showed that incorporating high porous and rough brick aggregate to replace natural aggregate is beneficial in improving the mixtures' slump, which is essential for retaining the shape of the printed layers. However, it decreased the flowability, setting time and open time when incorporating up to 50% brick aggregate. The green, flexural and compressive strengths were increased with increasing brick aggregate content up to 50% due to enhancing interlock between the binder and brick aggregate, and the better compaction because of the absorption properties of brick aggregate. The mechanical results revealed the better performance of 3D printed specimens than the cast specimens. Moreover, the incorporation of brick aggregate enhanced the buildability of the mixtures showcasing their potential in advancing 3D printing capabilities.

AB The design and formulation of an environmentally friendly, renewable, and reusable biobased resin for additive manufacturing is highly sought-after. Materials that incorporate covalent adaptable network (CAN) chemistry, which facilitate recycling, show significant promise. However, it is challenging to develop biobased vitrimer materials for 3D printing applications that are reprintable. In this study, we present a bis-dynamic covalent polymer network derived from cystamine and vanillin, featuring disulfide- and imine-based dynamic covalent bonds. The cystamine methacrylate vanillin (CMAV) was designed and synthesized by using vanillin and cystamine under mild reaction conditions at room temperature without the requirement for any catalyst. Three series of resin formulations were created using 15, 25, and 35 wt % CMAV with isobornyl acrylate as a reactive diluent and 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyldiphenyl phosphine oxide (TPO) as a photoinitiator. The 3D printing capabilities of these resin formulations were validated by using a DLP 3D printer. The resulting 3D-printed objects exhibited self-healing ability and shape memory effect at both ambient and elevated temperatures of 90 degrees C. The reprintability was confirmed by heating the 3D-printed objects with an excess of diethylene triamine (DETA) in the presence of THF at 80 degrees C for 48 h. Subsequently, vanillin methacrylate was added to the viscous resin obtained after the removal of THF, enabling further 3D printing.

AB Wastes and by-products of the food industry are often overlooked and utilized or underutilized. Of late, the emphasis is being given to recover, recycle, and recondition waste, promoting sustainable food processing. In this research, grape pomace and broken wheat which are otherwise sent for animal feed were collected from industries and were used as key ingredients of a 3D printing material supply for the production of functional cookies. The administration of grape pomace augmented the nutritional value and antioxidant properties of the cookies. Printing using a nozzle diameter of 1.28 mm, extruder motor speed of 600 rpm, and print speed of 400 mm/min gave the optimal printability for the in-house developed extrusion-based food 3D printer CARK. The printed constructs were post-processed at 130 degrees C for 12 min and the 6% grape pomace formulation received the highest preference during sensory evaluation. Interestingly, the developed product was rich in proteins and dietary fiber. This approach highlights the potential for value addition of industrial waste streams with good consumer preference. Accordingly, the unmatched levels of customization that additive manufacturing offers can be well complemented with personalizing foods in terms of nutritional content, whilst providing scope for cleaner production practices and improved recovery of resources from food processing wastes.

AB This study aims to develop 3D printable engineered cementitious composites (3DPECC) with incineration bottom ash (IBA) for the enhancement of sustainability. The impacts of using IBA to substitute aggregate (0%, 20%, 40%, and 60% by volume) on the fresh properties, hydration kinetics, and hardened properties of 3DPECC were investigated. The 3DPECC incorporated IBA was firstly tailored for 3D printing by the optimization of fresh properties. The results show that the addition of IBA enhances hydration degree while leading to a porous IBA in the matrix. Due to the enhanced hydration degree, printed specimens with 20% IBA substitution exhibit improved tensile strength (6.19 MPa), compressive strength (50.47 MPa), and flexural strength (22.60 MPa) compared to that of printed specimens without IBA. Due to the porous IBA, printed specimens with 60% IBA substitution reduce 14.9%, 1.5%, and 14.5% on the tensile, compressive, and flexural strength, respectively, compared to printed specimens with 20% IBA substitution. Sustainability analysis reveals that 3DPECC with 60% IBA substitution reduces 1.27 kg/m3 and 14.74 $/m3 on embodied carbon and cost, respectively, compared to that of 3DPECC without IBA. The findings reveal that recycling IBA in 3DPECC is a feasible solution to facilitate municipal solid waste management and sustainable construction.

ID BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; ELASTOMER; HYDROGEL; SCAFFOLDS
AB Soft robotics greatly benefits from nature as a source of inspiration, introducing innate means of safe interaction between robotic appliances and living organisms. In contrast, the materials involved are often nonbiodegradable or stem from nonrenewable resources, contributing to an ever-growing environmental footprint. Furthermore, conventional manufacturing methods, such as mold casting, are not suitable for replicating or imitating the com-plexity of nature's creations. Consequently, the inclusion of sustainability concepts alongside the development of new fabrication procedures is required. We report a customized 3D-printing process based on fused deposition modeling, printing a fully biodegradable gelatin-based hydrogel (biogel) ink into dimensionally stable, complex objects. This process enables fast and cost-effective prototyping of resilient, soft robotic applications from gels that stretch to six times their original length, as well as an accessible recycling procedure with zero waste. We present printed pneumatic actuators performing omnidirectional movement at fast response times (less than a second), featuring integrated 3D-printed stretchable waveguides, capable of both proprio-and exteroception. These soft devices are endowed with dynamic real-time control capable of automated search-and-wipe routines to detect and remove obstacles. They can be reprinted several times or disposed of hazard-free at the end of their lifetime, potentially unlocking a sustainable future for soft robotics.

AB This work aimed to evaluate the capacity of recycled fine powder glass (RFPG) to reinforce the mechanical performance and characteristics of polylactic acid (PLA) for use in 3D printing (3DP) applications. Six composites with an RFPG filler quantity of 2.0 wt %-12.0 wt % (with a 2.0 step) were evaluated. The raw materials were turned into mixtures, which then fabricated respective filaments. The filaments were inspected and tested for their properties before being utilized to produce the specimens for testing with 3DP. The structures, morphologies, and mechanical properties of the specimens were examined by performing respective tests, scanning electron microscopy, and micro-computed tomography (m-CT). Moreover, the samples were tested for their thermal properties through thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analyses, and for their rheological performance. Quality metrics were evaluated with m-CT (porosity and dimensional accuracy). The findings indicated that RFPG as a filler reinforced the PLA matrix, in the case of 6.0 wt % (23.6 % and 28.7 % strength enhancement in the flexural and tensile tests respectively). The thermal properties were insignificantly changed with a small increase in the crystallization temperature, while the viscosity was significantly lowered with the increase of the powder content in the compounds. The quality metrics were enhanced as well, making this specific RFPG grade a promising filler for the PLA matrix in 3D printing. (c) 2025 The Authors.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the potential of three-dimensional printing technology for the remanufacturing of end-of-life (EoL) composites. This technology will enable the rapid fabrication of environmentally sustainable structures with complex shapes and good mechanical properties. These three-dimensional printed objects will have several application fields, such as street furniture and urban renewal, thus promoting a circular economy model.
   Design/methodology/approach For this purpose, a low-cost liquid deposition modeling technology was used to extrude photo-curable and thermally curable composite inks, composed of an acrylate-based resin loaded with different amounts of mechanically recycled glass fiber reinforced composites (GFRCs). Rheological properties of the extruded inks and their printability window and the conversion of cured composites after an ultraviolet light (UV) assisted extrusion were investigated. In addition, tensile properties of composites remanufactured by this UV-assisted technology were studied.
   Findings A printability window was found for the three-dimensional printable GFRCs inks. The formulation of the composite printable inks was optimized to obtain high quality printed objects with a high content of recycled GFRCs. Tensile tests also showed promising mechanical properties for printed GFRCs obtained with this approach.
   Originality/value The novelty of this paper consists in the remanufacturing of GFRCs by the three-dimensional printing technology to promote the implementation of a circular economy. This study shows the feasibility of this approach, using mechanically recycled EoL GFRCs, composed of a thermoset polymer matrix, which cannot be melted as in case of thermoplastic-based composites. Objects with complex shapes were three-dimensional printed and presented here as a proof-of-concept.

AB The tensile behavior of an additively manufactured (AM) polymer matrix composite (PMC) is studied with in situ X-ray computed microtomography (CT) and digital volume correlation (DVC). In this experiment, the effects of recycled material content and print direction on the selective laser-sintered (SLS) material's mechanical response are explored. The PMC samples are printed in a tensile specimen geometry with gage lengths parallel to all three orthogonal, primary sintering directions. In situ tensile-CT experiments are conducted at Argonne National Laboratory's Advanced Photon Source 2-BM beamline. Analysis of the AM PMC's tensile response, failure, and strain evolution is analyzed both from a conventional standpoint, using the load-displacement data recorded by the loading fixture, and from a microstructural standpoint by applying DVC analysis to the reconstructed volumes. Significant variations on both strength and ductility are observed from both vantages with respect to print direction and the recycled material content in the printed parts. It is found that the addition of recycled source material with a thermal history reduces the tensile strength of the SLS composite for all directions, but the effect is drastic on the strength in the layering direction.

AB Form-stable phase change materials (PCMs) have garnered tremendous attention in thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their remarkable latent heat. However, the integration of intelligent manufacturing, recycling, and optimized multifunction is considered not feasible for form-stable PCMs due to the restriction of encapsulation technology. Here, an excellent polymer encapsulation strategy is proposed to prepare 3D printable, sustainable, and reliable form-stable PCMs (SiPCM-x), which are universal for petroleum-based and biobased long alkyl compounds. SiPCM-x have top-class latent heat, and the phase-change temperatures are tunable from body temperature to high temperature. The in situ formative bottlebrush phase-change polysiloxane networks are used as supporting materials, and the encapsulation mechanism is clarified. Sirbw-250 can be degraded and re-encapsulated to achieve recycling. Besides, Sirbw-250 is fabricated as the customer-designed objects with shape-changing behavior via 3D printing. By introducing the metal foams and nano-coatings, the resulting phase-change composites simultaneously exhibit excellent superhydrophobicity, mechanical properties, thermal conductivity, electromagnetic interference shielding behavior, and solar-, electric-, and magnetic-to-thermal energy conversion ability. Besides, S-Ni-SiPCM-250 can be applied in the wearable functional devices and movable solar-thermal charging. This strategy will lead to huge renovation in the TES field and provide an efficient guideline for designing advanced form-stable PCMs.

AB In this study, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are transformed into filament for 3D printing using an open-source design. Three different strip widths (8 mm, 9 mm, and 10 mm) of thickness 0.25 mm were investigated and the 1.60 mm nozzle extruder produced filaments with a hollow cross section of mean diameter 1.80 mm and a tolerance of - 0.03 mm and + 0.04 mm at a temperature of 245 degrees C. The study revealed that the 10 mm strip width is best suited for bottles of 0.25 mm thickness for the production of 1.75 mm filaments of 100% high-quality and ethical standards. Test specimens were 3D printed at three different flow rates (100%, 125%, and 150%), and the tensile strengths were evaluated using the ASTM D638 test standard. The maximum tensile strength (31.92 MPa) was obtained from the 10 mm strip width filament at a flow rate of 150%, and the ductility of all the specimens was less than 5%. Further test revealed that PLA has a tensile strength nearly as twice as the PET filament. However, while there is currently no virgin PET filament on the market, the recycle PET filament is a suitable substitute for commercial filaments for 3D products with tensile strength in the range of 30 MPa.

AB Heavily resource-reliant transportation and harsh living conditions, where humans cannot survive without a proper habitat, have prevented humans from establishing colonies on the Moon and Mars. Due to the absence of an atmosphere, potential habitats on the Moon or Mars require thick and strong structures that can withstand artificially produced internal pressure, potential meteoroid strikes, and the majority of incoming radiation. One promising way to overcome the noted challenges is the use of additive manufacturing (AM), also known as 3D printing. It allows producing structures from abundant materials with minimal material manipulation as compared to traditional constructing techniques. In addition to constructing the habitat itself, 3D printing can be utilized for manufacturing various tools that are useful for humans. Recycling used-up tools to compensate for damaged or unfunctional devices is also possible by melting down a tool back into raw material. While space 3D printing sounds good on paper, there are various challenges that still have to be considered for printing-assisted space missions. The conditions in space are drastically different from those on Earth. This includes factors such as the absence of gravity, infinitesimal pressure, and rapid changes in temperature. In this paper, a literature study on the prospects of additive manufacturing in space is presented. There are a variety of 3D printing techniques available, which differ according to the materials that can be utilized, the possible shapes of the final products, and the way solidification of the material occurs. In order to send humans to other celestial bodies, it is important to account for their needs and be able to fulfill them. An overview of requirements for potential space habitats and the challenges that arise when considering the use of additive manufacturing in space are also presented. Finally, current research progress on 3D printing Lunar and Martian habitats and smaller items is reviewed.

AB This work explores the role of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) in achieving the relevant sustainable development goals (SDGs) that were set out by the United Nations. The study focuses on the recent progress and limitations of the three dominant types of cementitious mixtures, ordinary Portland cement (OPC), recycled aggregate-based cement, and geopolymers, and real-world applications for 3DCP. The study reveals that 3DCP has a significant advantage in terms of cost, with a potential to save around 78% and 60% of the costs associated with conventional construction methods and labor, respectively. Moreover, 3DCP consumes less water than conventional construction methods, with a water usage reduction of 20%. Additionally, it was found that 3DCP is on track to reduce the global energy utilization by 5% by the year 2025. Even though 3DCP bears a lower climate change impact, there is still work to be done to improve its sustainability.

AB PurposeThis paper aims to investigate methods for designing and producing a 3D-printed bike saddle through a single 3D printing process that eliminates the need for additional manual assembly of parts. The study describes and illustrates the design and explores printing criteria for each component of the bike saddle.Design/methodology/approachA practice-based methodology was employed in this study to demonstrate a novel form of knowledge through design practice. Inspired by the construction of spacer textiles, the padding layer of the saddle was designed with a zigzag structure to provide shock-absorbing support for cycling. The rails part was designed to provide extra strength to the prototype.FindingsThis study compared the physical strength of new and original shapes of rail designs using the finite element (FE) method. With minor modifications to the rail geometry, computational analyses predicted a 23% reduction in the maximum absolute stress and a 49% decrease in deformation. In addition to the finite element (FE) analysis, compression testing was conducted using a custom hip model. The prototype remained structurally intact after ten cycles under a 230 kg load. Furthermore, results from a cycling durability test conducted over a period exceeding one year demonstrated that the prototype maintained its integrity after 1,000 km of riding.Originality/valueThis research addresses a knowledge gap in the development of an assembly-free bike saddle produced via a single 3D printing process. By developing and evaluating this design, the study offers valuable insights into both design theory and practical applications for similar products. Moreover, the study highlights the recycling potential of 3D printing materials; the bike saddle, made from thermoplastic materials using a Fused Filament Fabrication (FDM (TM)) printer, facilitates recycling at the end of its lifecycle.

AB Waste from hundreds of thousands of tons of non-recyclable end-of-life wind turbine blades will be generated within the next decades. This work studies the effect of recycled fiber categories on the tensile properties of reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) specimens made by fused filament fabrication 3D printing. Three different fiber categories, that is, virgin, ground, and pyrolyzed, are examined and compared experimentally and analytically using micromechanical models. Tensile tests are performed on different PLA specimens prepared with the three fiber categories and two fiber contents of 5% and 10% per ASTM D638. Compared to virgin fibers, both recycled fibers, that is, ground and pyrolyzed fibers, exhibit higher strength and stiffness values. Ground recycled fibers showed higher ultimate tensile strength compared to the pyrolyzed ones, while higher stiffness values were obtained for pyrolyzed fibers. Single fiber tensile tests, pull-out interfacial strength tests, thermal analysis, and microscopic imaging are performed to evaluate parameters used in the micromechanical models. The Halpin-Tsai and Cox models showed good agreement with the experimental modulus results with errors less than 5% for pyrolyzed fibers, while the minimum prediction error was 24.1% for strength results.

AB A highly sought-after objective of Space Agencies is the development of additive manufacturing (AM) technologies and of multifunctional materials, key elements to future exploration and colonization of Moon and Mars. The 3D printing process via fused filament fabrication (FFF) is increasingly viewed as an interesting approach for the in-situ manufacturing of buildings and items using regolith as a feedstock material, enabling the necessary repair and recycling capabilities to ensure crew safety. In this work, we investigate the radiation shielding properties and the FFF 3D printing process of polyethylene-based composites filled with Martian regolith. The on-line tool for the assessment of radiation in space (OLTARIS) software developed by NASA was used to assess the radiation shielding effectiveness of polyethylene (PE)/regolith (RG) composites in the Martian radiation environment. A basalt powder with chemical composition similar to that of Mars soil was used as Martian regolith simulant in the 3D printing process. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine the melting properties and crystallization degree of PE/RG composites at different RG concentrations, in order to analyze the effect of the simulant on the process parameters of filament extrusion and 3D printing. Low-impact Izod tests were also performed, with all PE/RG composites showing improved impact strength with respect to neat PE. Based on the DSC and Izod tests results, filaments of PE/RG composites were fabricated and used to 3D-print samples for tensile tests and 3-point bending tests. Results demonstrate the radiation shielding effectiveness of PE/RG composites and the capability of 3D-printers based on FFF to successfully manufacture components made of PE/RG composites starting from extruded filaments.

AB Current research and technical standards primarily rely on observational methods to evaluate the printability of 3D printing materials. There is a lack of quantitative assessment metrics for extrudability and supportability, and experimental data cannot be used to characterize extrudability and buildability. Further research is needed. Based on traditional workability parameters (such as flowability), this study explored the influence of printability characteristics and adopted two quantitative indicators-extrusion uniformity and cumulative deformation rate-to comprehensively evaluate material performance from two aspects, while observing the trend of changes in traditional workability indicators and print quality under experimental conditions. The experimental results showed that the extrusion uniformity of 3D-printed mortar initially improved and then gradually deteriorated as flowability increased, and was inversely proportional to dynamic yield stress. The cumulative deformation rate decreases with the improvement of height retention capability and the increase in static yield stress. Through parameter analysis, the optimal printing performance conditions were determined: when the extrusion uniformity is below 3.3% and the cumulative deformation rate is <= 6%, the corresponding dynamic yield stress range is 200 Pa to 800 Pa, and the static yield stress range is 1800 Pa to 3300 Pa. Under these parameters, the mortar exhibits excellent printing performance, including high-layer stacking capability (>= 30 layers) and enhanced structural stability. This experiment demonstrates that using these two quantitative indicators can simply and efficiently evaluate the performance metrics of 3D-printed materials, while also revealing the relationship between the workability and printing quality of 3D-printed recycled micro-powder geopolymer materials.

AB The benefits of additive manufacturing (AM) are widely recognised, boosting the AM method's use in industry, while it is predicted AM will dominate the global manufacturing industry. Alas, 3D printing's growth is hindered by its sustainability. AM methods generate vast amounts of residuals considered as waste, which are disposed of. Additionally, the energy consumed, the materials used, and numerous other factors render AM unsustainable. This paper aims to bring forward all documented solutions in the literature. The spotlight is on potential solutions for the Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) AM, focusing on Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), as these are candidates for mass manufacturing by industry. Solutions are evaluated critically, to identify research gaps regarding the recyclability of residual material. Only then can AM dominate the manufacturing industry, which is extremely important since this is a milestone for our transition into sustainable manufacturing. This transition itself is a complex bottleneck on our quest for becoming a sustainable civilisation. Unlike previous reviews that primarily concentrate on specific AM recycling materials, this paper explores the state of the art in AM recycling processes, incorporating the latest market data and projections. By offering a holistic and forward-looking perspective on the evolution and potential of AM, this review serves as a valuable resource for researchers and industry professionals alike.

AB A comparison between low-clinker cement and geopolymer mortars for their application in 3 D printing is discussed in this paper. The mortars are composed of materials with low environmental impact, such as cements with low clinker content, by-products of the industry and recycled aggregates. The developed mortars were both mechanically and rheologically characterized. The environmental impact was studied by LCA. To select the most suitable dosages, MCDM analysis was applied based on cost of materials, printability and LCA. Compressive strength was considered as a normalizing parameter for both the LCA and cost. The mortars showed good printability and suitable mechanical strength, being higher in the cement mortars. The LCA showed that the geopolymer mortars have a higher environmental impact due to the use of sodium hydroxide. Likewise, MCDM revealed that low-clinker cement mortars are at the top of the ranking, due to a lower environmental impact and lower cost of materials.

AB Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation. The liquid precursor allows for easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate-free films. Taking advantage of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene can be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (approximate to 15 wt.%) and well-dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50 nm) high-entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes is demonstrated via a selective in situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the high structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects show an electrical conductivity of 4380 S m(-1) and a compressive modulus of 31.8 MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components.

AB Recently, much work has been reported on virgin/recycled high-density polyethylene (HDPE) for 3D printing applications using the material extrusion process (MEP). However, little has been reported on the reinforcement of stubble waste powder (SWP) into the HDPE matrix to fabricate tiles using MEP. In this study, the HDPE matrix was reinforced with SWP (15% by wt.) to fabricate filament, which was used to manufacture the compressive specimen (per the ASTM-D695) as the functional prototype of the tiles. The result of this study suggests that the best parameters of the MEP based on the compressive peak strength (24.70 MPa) are infill percentage (IP) of 100%, nozzle temperature (NT) of 210 degrees C, and infill type (IT) triangle, and for modulus of elasticity (MOE) (143.13 MPa), IP of 80%, NT of 210 degrees C, and IT zigzag. The percentage improvement of compressive peak strength and MOE of recycled HDPE (without reinforcement) and HDPE reinforced with SWP was 32.43% and 61.54%, respectively. The results are supported by the photomicrographs, surface roughness (Ra) profiles, 3D render images, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA).

AB Green recycled hybrid powder (RHP) was proved to partly replace cement to prepare 3D printable mortar, which can recycle the demolition waste and reduce carbon emissions. In this study, different contents of RHP and polyethylene fiber (PE fiber) were selected to prepare 3D printable RHP mortar (3DPRM). The initial rheological parameters, including dynamic yield stress, plastic viscosity, static yield stress and thixotropy, as well as the rheological parameters varying with time were investigated. Besides, the early-age hydration of RHP paste was studied to reveal the influence mechanism on rheological properties. The experimental results show that the dynamic yield stress, plastic viscosity and thixotropy as well as their time-varying properties were all increased with RHP replacement. The static yield stress of 3DPRM with 30 % RHP had the most significant enhancement, which was 416.5 % increased after resting for 20 min, showing the great buildability enhancement potential of RHP. The addition of PE fiber (6 mm and 12 mm) increased the rheological parameters of 3DPRM, among which the increase ratio of initial dynamic yield stress was 60 %-195 %. However, the increase ratio with time for dynamic/static yield stress of 3DPRM with PE fiber was lower than that without PE fiber, indicating that PE fiber had great effect on the extrudability but small effect on buildability of 3DPRM. The energy intensity, carbon emission and cost of RHP were 65.27 %, 66.57 % and 12.5 % lower than that of cement, illustrating the sustainable contribution of RHP for construction industry. The results can be used to guide the printability design of 3D printable mortar containing RHP and PE fiber.

AB This study analyzes the incorporation of recycled concrete aggregate (RCA) in 3D printable mixture designs using both traditional Portland cement systems and white cement systems. A comprehensive range of testing methods was employed, including rheological assessments through flow table tests, rheometer flow curve analysis, three-interval thixotropy testing (3ITT), and Vicat tests. Mechanical and durability properties were evaluated via compressive strength tests, water absorption and sorptivity tests, drying shrinkage tests, freeze-thaw tests, and wetting-drying tests. To explore the microstructural and physical characteristics and their relationships with mechanical performance, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was conducted. Results indicated that incorporating RCA led to a stickier mixture that hindered spreading ability and reduced open-time performance during 3D-printing operations. Static yield stress was more significantly affected by RCA than dynamic yield stress and viscosity, impacting the overall flow properties. Despite these challenges, high-strength mortar designs with compressive strengths of approximately 70 MPa were achievable through careful adjustment of mixture design parameters. Mixtures containing RCA exhibited higher water absorption and sorptivity rates than those with natural aggregates (NA), along with greater shrinkage and slightly higher strength loss under wet-dry conditions and freeze-thaw cycles. However, the negative impacts of RCA were minimal and deemed negligible, suggesting its potential for effective use with appropriate adjustments. Notably, the use of RCA in 3D-printable mixtures did not present any issues during the printing process or after hardening, indicating promising prospects for high-value-added applications in advanced 3D additive manufacturing.

AB Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) devices have gotten great attention in wearable power sources and physiological monitoring. However, the complicated assembling and the molding processing retard their applications. Here, 3D-printed TENGs (3DP-TENGs) are designed and readily fabricated by a single integrated process without additional assembling steps. The TENGs contain poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as the two electrification components. Conductive CNTs also serve as electrodes. Elastic PGS matrix makes TENGs intrinsically responsive to biomechanical motions leading to robust energy outputs. The hierarchical porous structure of the 3DP-TENG results in higher output efficiency than traditional molded microporous TENG counterparts. TENGs with different 3D shapes are readily fabricated for different applications. The 3DP-TENG insole efficiently harvests biomechanical energy to drive electronics. A ring-shaped TENG acts as a self-powered sensor to monitor the motion of fingers. Furthermore, the use of bio-based and biodegradable PGS matrix combining with efficient recycle of CNTs makes 3DP-TENGs favorable from sustainable perspective. This work provides a new strategy to design and tailor 3D TENGs that will be very useful for diverse electronic applications.

AB The increasing accumulation of plastic waste-especially from packaging and post-consumer sources-calls for the development of sustainable recycling strategies. Due to the challenges associated with sorting mixed waste, directly processing waste streams offers a practical approach. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) are common consumer plastics, but they are difficult to recycle together due to immiscibility and degradation. In mixed waste, recycled HDPE (r-HDPE) often contaminates the recycled PET (r-PET) stream. Additive manufacturing (AM) offers a promising solution to upcycle these mixed polymers into functional products with minimal waste. This study investigates the processing and characterization of r-PET/r-HDPE blends for AM, focusing on the role of compatibilizers in enhancing their properties. Blends were melt-compounded using a twin-screw extruder to improve dispersion, followed by direct pellet-based 3D printing. A compatibilizer (0-7 php) was incorporated to improve miscibility. Rheological testing showed that the 5 php compatibilizer optimized viscosity and elasticity, ensuring smoother extrusion. Thermal analysis revealed a 30 degrees C increase in crystallization temperature and a shift in decomposition temperature from 370 degrees C to 400 degrees C, indicating improved thermal stability. Mechanical testing showed a tensile strength of 35 MPa and 17% elongation at break at optimal loading. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed reduced phase separation and improved morphology. This work demonstrates that properly compatibilized r-PET/r-HDPE blends enable sustainable 3D printing without requiring polymer separation. The results highlight a viable path for the conversion of plastic waste into high-value, customizable components, contributing to landfill reduction and advancing circular economy practices in polymer manufacturing.

AB Microfluidics research for various applications, including drug delivery, cell-based assays and biomedical research has grown exponentially. Despite this technology's enormous potential, drawbacks include the need for multistep fabrication, typically with lithography. We present a one-step fabrication process of a microfluidic chip for drug dissolution assays based on a 3D printing technology. Doxorubicin porous and non-porous microspheres, with a mean diameter of 250 mu m, were fabricated using a conventional "batch" or microfluidic method, based on an optimized solid-in-oil-in-water protocol. Microspheres fabricated with microfluidics system exhibited higher encapsulation efficiency and drug content as compared with batch formulations. We determined drug release profiles of microspheres in varying pH conditions using two distinct dissolution devices that differed in their mechanical barrier structures. The release profile of the "V" shape barrier was similar to that of the dialysis sac test and differed from the "basket" barrier design. Importantly, a cytotoxicity test confirmed biocompatibility of the printed resin. Finally, the chip exhibited high durability and stability, enabling multiple recycling sessions. We show how the combination of microfluidics and 3D printing can reduce costs and time, providing an efficient platform for particle production while offering a feasible cost-effective alternative to clean-room facility polydimethylsiloxane-based chip microfabrication.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM), also called 3D-printing, is an innovative technology, as the printing of objects is performed by layer-by-layer deposition. A wide variety of materials can be used to produce a variety of shapes that cannot be achieved using any other technology. AM started as a prototyping in plastics, and now it is successfully implemented with metals. AM in metals, first of all, in Titanium alloys, offers the potential to not only generate net-shape, complex geometrical and light-weight objects, but also to achieve enhanced mechanical properties, even better than achieved by traditional mass production, like casting.
   However, the priority of achieving good non-porous microstructure and the desired mechanical properties is a challenge for the main fields of applications of Titanium AM, such as the aerospace industry and production of medical implants. Thus, the quality of the powder and standardization of the AM process are the top priority. The potential recycling of the Ti-6Al-4 V powder as an inextricable part of the AM process needs to be explored.
   The influence of powder recycling on Ti-6Al-4 V additive manufacturing, the correct number of cycles, the requirements of the recycling procedures, and possible post processing procedures - are still open questions. This research aims to answer these questions. Two identical test cylinder sets were printed, one from recycled powder and one from the new powder batch. The cylinders were printed by the Arcam EBM A2X machine using a start platform of 210 x 210 mm in size. Electron Beam Melting (EBM) is a well-known effective manufacturing process. This AM technology utilizes high power electron beam to produce layer-by-layer metal parts for various applications, such as fabrication of biomedical implants and aerospace components. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the printed specimens from the two sets (new and recycled Ti-6Al-4 V powder) were investigated before and after heat treatment.

AB One of the fields in the construction industry where 3D printing of cementitious composites can play a significant role is associated with manufacturing of lightweight structures. Thanks to 3D printing, structural self- weight can be reduced by topology optimization of printed elements. Moreover, further decrements of self- weight and im- provement of thermal insulating properties can be achieved by the mixture design and introduction of materials of low thermal conductivity. To date, limited knowledge on lightweight printable mixtures is available. The main objective of this study is to develop 3D printed lightweight concrete (3DPLWC) mixture, with the intention of re- placing natural aggregate with waste glass (WG) by 50 vol.-% and 10 0 vol.- %. Moreover, expanded thermoplas- tic microspheres (ETM) were incorporated into the mixture. This led to a reduction in density of the mixtures as well as the thermal conductivity by up to 40 %. Comprehensive evaluation of material's fresh properties revealed that the addition of ETM results in 3D printable material with lower yield shear stress and higher plastic viscosity by 28 % and 66 %, respectively, compared to the mixes without ETM. Moreover, improvement of shape retention, flowability, setting times, and early- hardened mixtures' properties was observed. The mechanical properties of 3DPLWC showed that the replacement of natural aggregate by 50 vol.-% WG led to enhanced flexural and com- pressive strength of the composite, while full replacement resulted in retaining or slight reduction of the mechan- ical properties.

AB The objective of this investigation is to study the printing parameter requirements for sustainable 3D printable geopolymer materials. Side streams of the paper, mining, and construction industries were applied as geopolymer raw materials. The effect of printing parameters in terms of buildability, mixability, extrudability, curing, Al-to-Si ratio, and waste materials utilisation on the fresh and hardened state of the materials was studied. The material performance of a fresh geopolymer was measured using setting time and shape stability tests. Standardised test techniques were applied in the testing of the hardened material properties of compressive and flexural strength. The majority of developed suitable 3D printable geopolymers comprised 56-58% recycled material. Heating was used to improve the buildability and setting of the material significantly. A reactive recyclable material content of greater than 20% caused the strength and material workability to decrease. A curing time of 7-28 days increased the compressive strength but decreased the flexural strength. The layers in the test samples exhibited decreased and increased strength, respectively, in compressive and flexural strength tests. Geopolymer development was found to be a compromise between different strength values and recyclable material contents. By focusing on specialised and complex-shape products, 3D printing of geopolymers can compete with traditional manufacturing in limited markets.

AB PurposeThe integration of 3D-printing technology into radiation therapy (RT) has allowed for a novel method to develop personalized electron field-shaping blocks with improved accuracy. By obviating the need for handling highly toxic Cerrobend molds, the clinical workflow is significantly streamlined. This study aims to expound upon the clinical workflow of 3D-printed electron cutouts in RT and furnish one year of in-vivo dosimetry data. Methods and materials3D-printed electron cutouts for 6x6 cm, 10x10 cm, and 15x15 cm electron applicators were designed and implemented into the clinical workflow after dosimetric commissioning to ensure congruence with the Cerrobend cutouts. The clinical workflow consisted of four parts: i) the cutout aperture was extracted from the treatment planning system (TPS). A 3D printable cutout was then generated automatically through custom scripts; ii) the cutout was 3D-printed with PLA filament, filled with tungsten ball bearings, and underwent quality assurance (QA) to verify density and dosimetry; iii) in-vivo dosimetry was performed with optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLDs) for a patient's first treatment and compared to the calculated dose in the TPS; iv) after treatment completion, the 3D-printed cutout was recycled. ResultsQA and in-vivo OSLD measurements were conducted (n=40). The electron cutouts produced were 6x6 cm (n=3), 10x10 cm (n=30), and 15x15 cm (n=7). The expected weight of the cutouts differed from the measured weight by 0.4 + 1.1%. The skin dose measured with the OSLDs was compared to the skin dose in the TPS on the central axis. The difference between the measured and TPS doses was 4.0 + 5.2%. ConclusionThe successful clinical implementation of 3D-printed cutouts reduced labor, costs, and removed the use of toxic materials in the workplace while meeting clinical dosimetric standards.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM) of polymeric materials enables the manufacturing of complex structures for a wide range of applications. Among AM methods vat photopolymerization (VP) is desired owing to improved efficiency, excellent surface finish, and printing resolution at the micron-scale. Nevertheless, the major portion of resins available for VP are based on systems with limited or negligible recyclability. Here, we describe an approach that enables the printing of a resin that is amenable to re-printing with retained properties and appearance. To that end, we take advantage of the potential of polythiourethane chemistry, which not only permits the click reaction between polythiols and polyisocyanates in the presence of organic bases, allowing a fast-printing process but also chemical recycling, reshaping, and reparation of the printed structures, paving the way toward the development of truly sustainable recyclable photoprintable resins. We demonstrate that this closed-loop 3D printing process is feasible both at the macroscale and microscale via DLP or DLW, respectively.

AB Thermoset composites often face a challenging trade-off between recyclability and high performance. In this study, an innovative closed-loop manufacturing approach that integrates frontal ring-opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) with 3D printing to produce fully recyclable carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (c-CFRPs) is presented. A self-propagating FROMP-enabled direct ink writing (DIW) printing technology is developed, enabling in situ curing within seconds. This breakthrough eliminates the need for post-processing and reduces energy consumption by two orders of magnitude compared to traditional autoclave methods. By copolymerizing dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) with a commercial spiroacetal monomer (<= 3 wt.%), acid-degradable resins that retain the tensile strength of conventional thermosets are introduced while allowing for matrix depolymerization under mild conditions. The DCPD-based c-CFRPs demonstrate remarkable tensile strengths of up to 817 MPa and glass transition temperatures exceeding 160 degrees C. In a significant advancement, the recovered carbon fibers retain their pristine morphology and over 95% of their original mechanical properties, enabling repeated recycling without performance loss. Additionally, recovered oligomers can be repolymerized into new resins, further enhancing sustainability. This work presents a groundbreaking solution for high-performance composite manufacturing, addressing critical energy and waste challenges in the thermoset industry.

AB The recycling of materials is in line with the policy of a closed-loop economy and is currently an option for managing waste in order to reuse it to create new products. To this end, 3D printing is being used to produce materials not only from pure polymers but also from their composites. Further development in this field seems interesting and necessary, and the use of recycled materials will help to reduce waste and energy consumption. This article deals with the use of degradable waste materials for the production of insulating materials by 3D printing. For the study, samples with different numbers of layers (one and five), composite thickness (20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 mm) and composition (including colored resins that were transparent, black, gray, and metallized, as well as resins that were colored gray using soybean oil and gray using natural fibers) were made. The role of natural fillers was played by glycerin and biomass ash with a weight ratio of 5%. The finished materials were tested, and the values of the coefficient of thermal resistance and heat transfer were determined. The best thermal properties among the tested materials were distinguished by a five-layer sample made of soybean-oil-based resin with a thickness of 100 mm. This sample's heat transfer coefficient was: 0.16 W/m2K. As a material for thermal insulation in 3D printing technology, biodegradable components have great potential.

AB In the past two decades number of studies have been reported on the use of thermoplastics as a substrate for 3D printed patch antennas. However, no work has been reported on the thermoplastic-thermosetting composite-based substrate for 3D printed patch antennas and their mechanical, morphological, rheological, and radiofrequency (RF) characterization for sensing applications. In this study low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and LDPE-5% bakelite (BAK) composite-based patch antenna (resonating frequency 2.45 GHz) were printed (for secondary recycling) on fused deposition modeling (FDM) setup. The RF characteristics were measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA). Ring resonator test was used for measuring the dielectric properties of substrates (which suggests that the dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and loss tangent (tan delta) for LDPE was 2.282 and 0.0045, whereas for LDPE-5%BAK the calculated epsilon(r) and tan delta was 2.0663, 0.0051 respectively). This study highlights that for the LDPE-5%BAK composite there was a marginal increase in the size of the patch antenna; but this resulted in improved transmittance, gain, and return loss for typical sensor applications. As regards to printability of substrate, 5% BAK resulted in a melt flow index (MFI) of 9.96 g/10 min in contrast to 12.208 g/ 1 0 min for a neat LDPE sample. The selected LDPE-5%BAK composite resulted in peak strength (PS) and break strength (BS) of 16.08 MPa and 14.47 MPa (at 180 degrees C screw temperature, 110 rpm, and II kg load) while processing with a twinscrew extruder (TSE), which was observed better than the neat LDPE (PS 11.98 MPa, BS 10.79 MPa). The results were supported with porosity (%), surface roughness (Ra) analysis based upon scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and bond strength using attenuated total reflection (ATR) based Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) analysis.

AB The linear "take-make-dispose" model of plastic consumption has led to significant environmental challenges and unplanned waste legacies, emphasising the need for more sustainable recycling practices. This study explored the integration of post-consumer recycled polylactic acid (rPLA) into 3D printing filaments as a step towards sustainable manufacturing. Using 100% virgin PLA (vPLA) as the baseline, filaments were produced with rPLA-to-vPLA ratios of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% and evaluated for surface roughness, tensile strength, flexural properties, and hardness. The results revealed that increasing the rPLA content negatively affects the mechanical properties and surface quality. Surface roughness increased from 7.06 mu m for pure vPLA to 10.50 mu m for 100% rPLA, whilst the tensile and flexural strengths of 100% rPLA decreased by 48.4% and 49%, respectively, compared to vPLA. Hardness also declined, with 100% rPLA showing a 7.5% reduction relative to vPLA. Despite these reductions, the blends with up to 50% rPLA retained over 90% of the mechanical performance of pure vPLA, demonstrating a viable compromise between performance and sustainability. Morphological analysis highlighted poor interlayer adhesion and void formation as the primary causes of performance degradation in higher rPLA blends. Despite these challenges, this study demonstrated that rPLA-vPLA blends can extend the life cycle of PLA and promote sustainable manufacturing practices. By addressing polymer degradation challenges, this research supports the integration of recycled materials in 3D printing, contributing to the circular economy goals of recycling, resource efficiency, and sustainable manufacturing production outcomes.

AB Short carbon fiber (sCF)-based polymer composite parts enable one to increase in the material property range for additive manufacturing (AM) applications. However, room for technical and material improvement is still possible, bearing in mind that the commonly used fused filament fabrication (FFF) technique is prone to an extra filament-making step. Here, we compare FFF with direct pellet additive manufacturing (DPAM) for sCF-based composites, taking into account degradation reactions, print quality, and energy usage. On top of that, the matrix is based on industrial waste polymers (recycled polycarbonate blended with acrylonitrile butadiene styrene polymer and recycled propylene), additives are explored, and the printing settings are optimized, benefiting from molecular, rheological, thermal, morphological, and material property analyses. Despite this, DPAM resulted in a rougher surface finish compared to FFF and can be seen as a faster printing technique that reduces energy consumption and molecular degradation. The findings help formulate guidelines for the successful DPAM and FFF of sCF-based composite materials in view of better market appreciation.

AB The exponential growth of plastic production in the healthcare sector and the limited capacity of conventional recycling systems have created a global environmental challenge. Latest 3D printing technologies have the potential to solve this problem by enabling on-demand, localized manufacturing. This study aimed to investigate the mechanical properties of 3D-printed ABS composites with Bi2O3 fillers after multiple recycling and irradiation cycles to assess their suitability for creating robust, reusable supporting devices for radiotherapy. Filaments of PLA, ABS, and ABS composites enriched with 5 wt% and 10 wt% Bi2O3 were extruded, repeatedly recycled through shredding and re-extrusion up to ten times and irradiated to 70 Gy using a 6 MeV photon beam to simulate clinical radiotherapy conditions. In contrast to PLA, ABS demonstrated better recyclability; however, after ten recycling cycles, its tensile strength declined from 25.1 MPa to 20.9 MPa, and its Young's modulus decreased from 2503.5 MPa to 1410.4 MPa. Incorporation of 5 wt% Bi2O3 into ABS significantly improved recyclability and mechanical retention. After ten recycling rounds, an ABS composite containing 5 wt% Bi2O3 retained tensile strength of 22.2 MPa, modulus of 1553.9 MPa, and strain at break of 14.4%. In contrast, the composite enforced with 10 wt% Bi2O3 showed slightly lower performance, likely due to filler agglomeration. Under irradiation, the ABS-5 wt% Bi2O3 composite exhibited minimal additional degradation, maintaining mechanical integrity superior to other materials. These results indicate that ABS-5 wt% Bi2O3 is a promising, recyclable material for durable, patient-specific devices in radiotherapy, supporting sustainability in medical manufacturing.

   sustainability; sustainable development goals; circular economy
AB Glass is made from sand-a finite resource. Hence, there is a need to maintain glass in the industrial cycle as described in the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's circular-economy diagram. This research project examines the reallocation of material resources in the form of waste glass fines from the industrial recycling process for soda-lime glass. According to the plant manager of Reiling Glasrecycling Danmark ApS, the fines are currently sold to be used for insulation. Although this process prolongs the lifespan of the fines before they become landfill waste, a closed-loop circular option would be preferable. In order to establish a closed-loop circular model for waste glass fines, this research investigates their material and aesthetic qualities and proposes a strategy for maintaining the fines in the closed loop cycle together with the soda-lime glass. The fines are manipulated through robotic deposition and formed into 3D geometries. To expand the aesthetic applications for the material, an investigation is conducted by combining 3D geometries with the traditional glassmaking techniques of glassblowing and casting. The research contributes knowledge of the materials' technical qualities including printability, durability and workability of the 3D prints combined with cast or blown recycled container glass as well as with blown waste glass fines. Technical obstacles are revealed and alternative routes for further explorations are suggested. Finally, the performative and aesthetic qualities of the results are discussed, while artistic applications for recycled soda-lime glass fines remain to be explored in future research.

AB In this study, photocurable resins based on glycerol and vanillin were designed, synthesized, and applied to digital light processing three-dimensional (3D) printing and vitrimeric abilities such as shape-memory, self-healing, and recyclability have been investigated. First, photocurable resins were prepared and synthesized by combining renewable resources and photocuring as an environmentally friendly strategy for the synthesis of vitrimers. Afterward, the most suitable resin for optical 3D printing was selected by photorheometry, and the thermal and mechanical properties of the resulting polymers were tested. Furthermore, by activating dynamic transesterification reactions at elevated temperatures, the photocured polymer exhibited self-healing, recyclability, and shape-memory properties. The vitrimer with a weight ratio of 8:2 of glycerol- and vanillin-based monomers demonstrated a welding efficiency of tensile strength up to 114.12%, 75% recyclability by alcoholysis, and shape-memory properties above and below two glass transition temperatures.

AB The application of Additive Manufacturing (AM), such as 3D printing for complex rapid prototyping and manufacturing moving fast beyond imagination and one of the most prospective AM techniques is Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) process. The fabricated polymer components require diverse properties for different applications and some of these properties can be obtained by using polymer composite filaments consisting of various materials in different proportions. Therefore, it is imperative to understand how different properties are affected by various compositions of materials in FFF fabricated polymer components. This study evaluates and compares various properties such as microstructure and surface texture, mechanical behavior, thermal properties, and other general characteristics of different polymer composites fabricated by 3-D printing technology. For this purpose, six polymer composite specimens are prepared where Polylactic acid (PLA) and High-density polyethylene (HDPE) are the primary materials in all of them. Recycled plastic and (or) TiO2 nanoparticles are mixed in four specimens, and graphene coating is done in two samples. Extruded filaments are consumed in the (FFF process, where the process parameters are determined under an optimization model from machine learning. FESEM, EDX, and Particle analysis confirm that the nozzle temperature, derived from machine learning, perfectly aligns with the polymers' surface texture, layer, and microstructure. Graphene-coated samples show good profiles in roughness testing. Regarding mechanical behavior analysis, tensile strength, elongation, and hardness tests are conducted. Here, the sample infused with 1% nanoparticle but void of recycled plastic presents sufficient mechanical strength, and the graphene-coated samples show the improved property in terms of elongation. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) analysis authenticated the thermal properties of the samples. FTIR analysis identified the general characteristics in all specimens except the one with graphene-coating and recycled plastic.

AB The combination of cloud-based resources, user-friendly cloud-based design applications and 3D printing (3DP) is making possible a new sustainable paradigm in scientific research. Tools and components can be self-made by downloading model designs, optimizing those designs for individual experiments and printing locally. Together with the use of materials for 3DP filaments derived from renewable resources and recycling of old printed structures, science labs and institutes can significantly reduce their carbon footprint to meet their Sustainable Development Goals. This new sustainable paradigm is evaluated through a case study of sample preparation - a fundamental aspect of materials science. For high quality investigation of material microstructures, even to the atomic scale, sample preparation is critical. A range of 3DP plastic tools for preparing samples has been developed. The design and fabrication of a 3DP vibrational polishing machine and a 3DP dimpling machine are described along with test results from microstructural analyses of brass and silicon that show the high-quality scientific studies possible using these low-CO2e tools.

AB Extrusion-based concrete 3D printing is a promising technology and has the potential for being a sustainable construction solution by utilizing structural optimization and reduced material usage. However, studies focusing on the sustainability assessment of 3D printable concrete mixtures are not many. In the current study, a quantitative assessment of the environmental and economic impact of multiple 3D printable concrete mixtures for the production of one cubic meter volume is performed. 3D printable concrete mixtures made with (i) different binder systems and (ii) increasing aggregate content and modified gradation of the aggregate skeleton by adding natural and recycled coarse aggregates, satisfying a set of performance criteria, were evaluated. It was observed that the use of calcium sulfoaluminate-limestone binder systems has significantly lower global warming potential; however, the depletion of fossil resources indicator is much higher than compared to the Portland cement-based mixtures. Increasing the aggregate content decreases environmental impact; however, incorporating recycled and coarse aggregates do not significantly decrease the environmental impact at a lower replacement level. Also, it was found that the contribution of the chemical admixtures to the total material cost is significantly higher in the case of 3D printbale concrete mixtures in comparison to the conventional mould cast mixtures. The study provides insights into the environmental and economic impact of extrusion-based concrete 3D printing materials satisfying the same functional requirements.

AB Structurally colored objects with 3D geometries are intriguing in optical devices and visual sensors, but their preparation is bottlenecked by complicated procedures and limited material choices. Herein, a facile supramolecular 3D printing strategy is proposed via direct ink writing (DIW) supramolecular colloidal inks (SCIs) consisting of polymers and colloids based on supramolecular interactions to construct healable and recyclable structurally colored objects. Optimized supramolecular interactions balance the rheological requirements for DIW and the high particle volume fraction for the one-step and immediate generation of structural color. The shear-thinning and thixotropy features of the SCIs, characterized by a two-order-of-magnitude decrease in viscosity during the printing process and 50% storage modulus recovery thereafter, ensure the reversible solid-liquid transition during the extrusion and deposition process. The short-range ordered arrangements of colloids within the matrix give rise to angle-independent structural color. Moreover, 3D structurally colored objects from the SCIs are healable and, more importantly, can be closed-looped recycled thanks to the reversibility of supramolecular interactions. Leveraging optimized supramolecular interactions, various SCIs with a wide range of material choices meeting the DIW process are extended to construct 3D structurally colored objects directly. This study paves the way for constructing advanced 3D materials with a supramolecular strategy.
   A supramolecular 3D printing strategy is reported for the one-step generation of 3D structurally colored objects via direct ink writing supramolecular colloidal inks without post-treatment. The dynamic supramolecular interactions provide supramolecular colloidal inks with unique rheological behaviors for direct ink writing and endow 3D structurally colored objects with healability and recyclability. image

AB The increasing global use of plastic materials is leading to a corresponding rise in plastic wastes, posing significant environmental challenges. This research explores the effects of incorporating recycled plastic fibers (RPFs) derived from nylon and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) industry wastes into 3D-printed cementitious composites (3DPCC). The impact of using these two types of fibers on the fresh properties, rheological behavior, green strength, extrudability and buildability of 3DPCC is explored. The main variables in this study are fiber type, volume fraction (0.5 %, 1.0 %, and 2.0 %) and fiber length (6 mm and 12 mm). The results show that adding RPFs, particularly longer fibers, decreases the flowability and workability of 3DPCC, with PVC fibers having a more pronounced effect than nylon fibers. Utilizing RPFs in 3DPCC mixes increased plastic viscosity (PV) and yield stress (YS). At a volume fraction of 2 % and a length of 12 mm, PVC fibers increased the static yield stress by 214.5 %, the dynamic yield stress by 155.2 %, and the PV by 177.7 %. Furthermore, the results indicate that samples containing PVC fibers outperform those containing nylon fibers and samples without fiber content in terms of green compressive strength, crack pattern, and buildability. By using a fiber volume fraction of 2 % and 12-mm length, PVC fibers reduced structural failure by 36.8 %, allowing for the construction of 38 layers compared to 24 layers in the control sample.

All experiments were performed using 2-cm, acrylic 3D-printed centrifugal contactors. Solvent extraction tests were performed using 1 M N,N-di(2-ethylhexyl)butyramide (DEHBA)/dodecane and a nitric acid feed solution spiked with Am-243 and Ce-139 and oxidized with 60 mg mL(-1) sodium bismuthate. Approximately 72% of the Am was extracted with a single contactor stage. Co-stripping of Am and Ce was demonstrated but attempts at selective stripping were not successful. Successful recycle of the used organic phase was demonstrated. Contactor efficiencies of 95-100% were obtained.

AB This study employs recycled polycarbonate-based SORPLAS Impact as the material for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) in order to systematically investigate the effect of multiple printing parameters on flame-retardant performance. Four key parameters-infill pattern, infill density, primary layer height, and external solid layer thickness-were varied to fabricate test specimens, which were then subjected to combustion tests, thermal imaging, and grayscale analyses for quantitative evaluation. Temperature distribution and char formation behaviors were recorded during burning, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) along with Tukey's HSD comparisons was used to identify the critical factors influencing flame retardancy. The results show that infill density and external solid layer thickness significantly affect ignition time, flame propagation, and post-combustion structural integrity. While moderate increases in material content promote stable char formation and effective thermal insulation, excessive accumulation can lead to expansion and deformation. Grayscale variations in thermal images further verify how each parameter set influences heat conduction and char formation. Overall, the findings demonstrate that carefully balancing these printing parameters and material usage can enhance flame retardancy and mechanical properties of 3D-printed parts, while also aligning with sustainability objectives. This work provides practical guidelines for advancing recycled flame-retardant materials and their applications in additive manufacturing.

AB Given its exceptional mechanical properties, ductility, and durability, high-performance concrete (HPC) has become a focal point of research in the field of 3D concrete printing (3DCP) in recent years. To further enhance material properties, particularly compressive capability, flexural capacity, and interlayer bond strength, HPC that incorporates micron materials based on fiber reinforcement is presented in this study. Mechanical properties and microstructure are analyzed to explore the microparticle enhancement mechanism. Then, a self-developed 3DCP system is utilized to verify the printability of materials and achieve the regularity of print parameters and interlayer bond strength. Furthermore, the effects of micron materials on the properties of HPC are evaluated though group comparison. The optimal material and dosage of HPC under different properties are obtained by conducting a comparative analysis of the test results for various properties of three different materials. The current work not only creates HPC that enhances material properties, but also restores confidence in the development of 3D printing for the utilization of construction waste resources.

AB Recycling always acts as the best solution for the aggravated plastic pollution. One of the potential applications for these recycled plastics is 3D printing filaments in the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) Printers. However, the mechanical performance of recycled plastics may not up to standard for application, thus additives are essential to improve their mechanical properties. Talc powder has been used in the polymer industry for many years owing to its abundance, non-toxicity, high aspect ratio and low-cost. Besides traditional additive, the alternative to talc powder is the bio-oil extracted from food waste using in the recycled 3D printing filaments is also being investigated under our research study. The objective of this paper is studying the effectiveness of talc on mechanical properties alteration in different types of polymers, and the production method and ratio of talc content for talc-filled composites in previous works of literature. It is found that the twin-screw extrusion process is commonly adopted for many studies. It is confirmed that talc can improve stiffness, crystallization, thermal stability and modify the viscosity behavior of different polymers, but high talc content would reduce the impact strength and strain at break.

AB 3D printing technologies of construction materials are gaining ground in the building industry. As well documented in the literature, these advanced manufacturing methodologies aim to reduce work-related injuries and materials waste, enhancing architectural flexibility which would enable more sophisticated designs for engineering and aesthetic purposes. In this framework, the development of functional and eco-sustainable printable materials represents an extremely attractive challenge for research, promoting digital fabrication to reach its maximum cost-effective and technological potentials. The use of recycled tire rubber particles in 3D printable Portland-based compounds is an exclusive contribution in this field. This line of research aims to integrate the well-known engineering performances of rubber-cement materials with the advanced peculiarities of additive manufacturing methodologies. As an innovative contribution, the authors propose here a detailed study on the possible relationship between rubber particle size and technological properties of the 3D printable mix. Specifically, two groups of continuous size grading polymer aggregates (0-1 mm rubber powder and 1-3 mm rubber granules as fine and coarse fractions, respectively) were analyzed in terms of impact on rheology, print quality, microstructure, mechanical properties, and acoustic insulation performance. Concerning the print quality, rubber aggregates altered the fluidity of the fresh mix, improving the adhesion between the printed layers and therefore enhancing the mechanical isotropy in the post-hardening sample. A remarkable influence of the rubber gradation on the compounds' behaviour was found in hardened properties. By comparing the rubberized compounds, the fine polymer fraction shows greater interfacial cohesion with the cement paste. However, more significant mechanical strength loss was found due to a greater reduction in density and increased porosity degree. On the other hand, mortars doped with larger rubber particles tend to have a higher unit weight, finest pore distribution, minor mechanical strength drop, and higher ductility but worse interface binding with the matrix. Regarding the acoustic insulation properties, a proper balance between rubber powder and granules in the mixes allows to obtain comparable/superior performance compared to plain mortar but the effect of the aggregate size is strongly dependent on the sound frequency range investigated. Future findings revolve around applicability studies of these formulations in civil and architectural fields, benefiting from the design flexibility of 3D printing.

Thus, this study assesses the potential of using recycled fibre from face mask waste as fibre reinforcement in 3D concrete printing (3DCP) applications to improve printability while reducing landfill waste. The effect of recycled fibre from waste face masks on the rheological characteristics of printable mixes and the mechanical performance of printed elements was evaluated for different contents of shredded face masks (i.e., 1% and 2% by vol). The rheological properties like static and dynamic yield strengths, apparent viscosity, and thixotropic behaviour, along with compressive and flexural strength, were evaluated for 3D printed specimens and mechanical properties were compared to their mould-cast counterparts. Further, the variation in the interlayer bond strength and porosity due to different fibre dosages was also investigated. In addition, a comparative study on the fresh and hardened properties was performed for the printable mixes with polypropylene (PP) fibres and face masks. The addition of face masks significantly improved the rheological properties with good extrudability and buildability for all the dosages. Compared to face masks, mixes with PP fibres showed poor extrudability with higher fibre dosages. The compressive strength was increased by 41% for a 1% dosage of face masks when compared to the unreinforced concrete. Furthermore, the flexural strength when tested along the weaker interface, showed an increase of 74% and 82% for the addition of 1% and 2% face mask content. The interlayer bond strength of 1% face mask content showed 21% improvement and was observed to have the highest surface moisture content. The mechanical performance of face masks and PP fibres are observed to be comparable for 1% dosage. The mechanical prop-erties of printed and mould-cast specimens were also observed to be similar.

AB Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a structural illness, which causes both mental and physical pain in patients. Nowadays, 3D-printed scoliosis orthoses are effective in AIS treatment. Owing to the change in the body shape during orthopedic procedures, a complete course of treatment will need many orthoses to fit patients, which will increase medical expense and result in a large amount of nondegradable waste, thereby polluting the environment. Therefore, reconfigurable and recyclable 3D printed orthoses are desirable. However, the design of materials for such orthoses is fundamentally challenging. Herein, by incorporating disulfide bonds into a bifunctional photoactive acrylate monomer and using dithiothreitol to accelerate disulfide bond exchange, we obtained a stiff yet reconfigurable, recyclable, healable polymer that can be 3D printed into orthoses. This as-prepared polymer demonstrated a high mechanical strength (363.2 MPa Young's modulus and 146.3% maximum elongation) and excellent dynamic properties (reprocessable at 100 degrees C, recyclable upon dissolving in thiol-containing solvents, and healable upon heating). Orthoses manufactured via the 3D printing of this polymer can adapt to a patient's body through continuous reconfiguration, thus improving their effectiveness in treating AIS. Moreover, these orthoses can be recycled after use, and thus, medical waste can be significantly reduced.

AB Additive manufacturing, commonly known as three-dimensional (3D) printing, transforms simple in silico designs into real objects with accessibility, reproducibility, and precision. By merging the versatility of 3D printing with the inherent advantages of enzymatic processes, this technology opens up new possibilities for optimizing enzyme immobilization in continuous flow reactors. Here, we systematically investigate various formulations to develop an optimal biocatalytic ink capable of encapsulating enzymes and cofactors within a hydrogel matrix. The ink, composed of agarose and polyethylenimine (PEI), printed as porous monoliths, improved enzyme retention and cofactor absorption through ionic interactions, outperforming alternative formulations. By further integrating gold nanorods into the system, reaction substrates and intermediates (i.e., NAD+, isopropanol) can be detected through in operando surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensing, serving as a complementary tool for fluorescence microscopy. Using this optimized ink, we fabricated 3D-printed reactors with diverse architectures to evaluate their efficiency in the continuous flow reduction of ethyl acetoacetate. Reactors with a cross-shaped design exhibit stable product yields and minimize enzyme and cofactor leaching during continuous operation. Hence, we formulate and print a self-sufficient biocatalytic ink capable of sustaining the activity of immobilized dehydrogenases in continuous flow reactions without the addition of exogenous cofactors.

AB 3D printing of thermoplastic polymers is one of the common techniques for fabricating structural and non-structural components for engineering, aerospace, construction and household applications. But hitherto very less work has been performed on 3D printing of secondary recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene reinforced with industrial wastes such as bakelite powder, Fe powder and wood dust. So, in this research work flexural specimens were printed through fused deposition modelling technique form composite filaments prepared in-house (secondary recycled ABS 90% by weight reinforced with equal percentage of bakelite powder, Fe powder and wood dust) as per Taguchi's L9 orthogonal array. The influence of three FDM parameters (raster angle, infill density and infill speed) on the flexural strength of the fabricated specimen was also investigated and the results were analyzed using optical photomicrographs and scanning electron microscopy characterization. Optimal parametric settings for obtaining maximum peak strength (flexural) were 0 degrees raster angle, 20 mm/sec printing speed and 80% infill density. (c) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The utilization of heterogeneous photocatalysis for the breakdown of organic pollutants in wastewater has become increasingly popular as an alternative treatment method, offering rapid mineralization of organic compounds. However, the challenges lie in the recycling and recovery processes. To overcome this hurdle, a novel 3D-printed hybrid photocatalyst composed of graphene/MnO2/Fe3O4 was developed through an ex-situ approach. Comprehensive property evaluations were conducted, and the catalyst was employed in the creation of a 3D photocatalyst designed for MB dye removal under direct sunlight, facilitating the easy separation of the used catalyst. Further enhancement of its photocatalytic activity was achieved through carbonization, rendering it promising for wastewater treatment owing to its ordered structure and facile recovery. Notably, the developed 3D photocatalyst exhibited a significant improvement in MB dye degradation compared to powder samples. It showcased effective degradation of 10 ppm of MB dye within a mere 120 min of sunlight exposure. Radical trapping analysis indicated that the high photocatalytic degradation was predominantly attributed to the photogenerated superoxide radicals. Consequently, the 3D printed photocatalyst demonstrated exceptional reusability and sustained efficiency in MB dye degradation without any discernible decrease in catalytic activity. The augmented photocatalytic degradation was governed by the generation of photogenerated charge carriers through reduction and oxidation reactions. This research holds promise for the creation of an economical, userfriendly, and highly efficient 3D printed hybrid photocatalyst with synergistic applications in water purification.

AB Materials for thermal management of buildings offer an attractive approach to reduce energy demands and carbon emissions in the infrastructure sector, but many of the state-of-the-art insulators are still expensive, flammable, or difficult to recycle. Here, a 3D printing process is developed and studied to create hierarchical porous ceramics for thermal insulation and passive cooling using recyclable and widely available clay as raw material. Inks comprising particle-stabilized foams are employed as a template for the generation of the hierarchical porosity. Using foams with optimized rheological properties, the printing parameters and sintering conditions required for the manufacturing of hierarchical porous ceramics via Direct Ink Writing are established. The sintering temperature is found to strongly affect the size distribution of micropores, thus controlling the mechanical, thermal, and evaporative cooling properties of sintered printed structures. By combining suspension- and foam-based inks in a multimaterial printing approach, inexpensive and recyclable clay-based bricks are manufactured with structural, thermal insulating, and passive cooling capabilities.

AB Fused Filament Fabrication is a promising manufacturing technology for the circularity of space missions. Potential scenarios include in-orbit applications to maximize mission life and to support long-term exploration missions with in situ manufacturing and recycling. However, its adoption is restricted by the availability of engineering polymers displaying mechanical performance combined with resistance to space conditions. Here, a thermotropic Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) is reported as a candidate material with extrusion 3D printing. To expand its scope of applicability to structural parts for space applications, four different exposure conditions are studied: thermal cycling under vacuum, atomic oxygen, UV, and electron irradiations. While 1 MeV-electron irradiation leads to a green coloration due to annealable color centers, the mechanical performance is only slightly decreased in dynamic mode. It is also found that increased printing temperature improves transverse strength and resistance to thermal cycling with the trade-off of tensile stiffness and strength. Samples exposed to thermal cycling and the highest irradiation dose at lower printing temperatures still display a Young's modulus of 30 GPa and 503 MPa of tensile strength which is exceptionally high for a 3D-printed polymer. For the types of exposure studied, overall, the results indicate that LCP 3D-printed parts are well suited for space applications.
   Three-dimensional printed thermotropic liquid crystal polymers (LCP) exhibiting high tensile strength and stiffness, are found to withstand thermal cycling, atomic oxygen, UV, and electron irradiation. Notably, 1 MeV-electron irradiation induces green coloration from annealable color centers, without significantly compromising mechanical performance, affirming LCP's suitability for space applications. image

ID FILAMENT
AB This paper reports the effect of twin screw extrusion (TSE) process parameters on primary (1 degrees) recycled acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) for possible 3D applications. The ABS (virgin/recycled) is one of the most widely used thermoplastic materials for fused deposition modeling (FDM) based 3D printing of functional prototypes. But hitherto little has been reported on improving the mechanical/rheological/morphological and thermal properties of (1 degrees) recycled ABS while extrusion without any reinforcement (i.e. without secondary (2 degrees) recycling). In this work the granules of 1 degrees recycled ABS have been extruded after ascertaining suitable process parameters of TSE (namely: screw temperature, torque and dead weight). The results of study suggests that screw temperature 210 degrees C, 0.3Nm torque and dead weight of 13 kg are the best settings for TSE in the present case study. The TSE based extruded 1 degrees recycled ABS has improved crash resistance properties (as modulus of toughness was significantly improved to 3.261 MPa (from 0.191 MPa (for non TSE processed) and 0.081 for virgin ABS).

AB In this study, a 3D-printed graphene oxide (GO)/calcium alginate (CA) hybrid network (3D GO/CA) with excellent U(VI) adsorption performance was constructed using direct ink writing-based 3D printing technology and in situ calcium ion cross-linking technology. The GO and CA sheets in 3D GO/CA were stacked layer by layer. Meanwhile, the 3D multilayered pore structure with large-scale characteristics was constructed. Furthermore, the pore structure was orderly arranged, with abundant active adsorption sites (oxygen-containing functional groups/Ca2+ binding sites) exposed. The adsorption experiment results showed that 3D GO/CA exhibited a wide valid pH range (3-12) and excellent adsorption capacity for U(VI) in a strongly acidic solution (for example, at pH = 2.8, the adsorption capacity is 200.1 mg/g). In addition, 3D GO/CA exhibited high adsorption kinetic reaction rate (adsorption equilibrium could be reached within 30 min). In the simulated acidic wastewater (pH = 2.8), 3D GO/CA exhibited an excellent adsorption capacity of UO22+ and an adsorption ratio of approximately 99.7 %. The 3D GO/CA retained its original stable structure morphology after it was reused eight times. In addition, the stable structure of 3D GO/CA was retained after it was soaked in the strong acid solution at different concentrations (1.59 x 10-3-2 mol/L) for 48 h. With the aid of 3D printing technology and Ca2+ cross-linking technology, the structure of 3D GO/CA was optimized, and more oxygen-containing functional groups were retained at the edge of the GO sheet. Therefore, 3D GO/CA has a promising application prospect for removing and recovering U(VI) in acidic solutions.

AB This paper deals with an overview of additive manufacturing and its segment - 3D printing, which is today rapidly and widely used (Agashe et al., 2020) for personal and high-capacity production. The paper discusses the possible positive factors such as small and personalized production series, cheaper design and production process, complex geometry, bionic structures (whose surfaces are complicated to make, and are copy of biological organisms) and negative factors such as lack of educated specialists and trainings. Those facts are affecting the implementation of these technologies in different segments of the design, product development and furniture production. The impacts of new technologies on the design and production of rapid prototypes and finished products in furniture industry are analyzed. The positive results of using additive manufacturing indicate that, in spite of minor obstacles and problems with connecting different production processes, additive production will have a significant place in the future of furniture design and production. The most important advantages of 3D printing is fast prototyping, one piece production, free form designing and the use of bio-based materials and their possibility of recycling.

AB Structured monolithic catalysts have attracted increasing attention in the petrochemical industry due to their advantages of high heat and mass transfer rate, easy scale-up, and reusability. Herein, we put forward a strategy for one-step preparation of SiO2-based monolithic TS-1 catalysts with optimal hierarchical scaffolds by combining the flow field simulation of the reactor and 3D printing technology. Tunable hierarchical porosity from nano to micro scales, suitable pore characteristics, and numerous active sites have been obtained by innovatively combining the spherical porous structure of TS-1/SiO2 material, direct ink writing (DIW) and post -sintering processes. Combined with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, the effects of different channel offset angles, axial and radial channel sizes on the 3D printed monolithic TS-1 in the catalytic reaction of one-step oxidation of ethylene to ethylene glycol (EG) were verified. 3D-printed monolithic TS-1 catalysts exhibited superior crush strengths (135.11 N/cm) and extraordinary catalytic efficiency, in which the yield of EG reached 82.7%, and the utilization of hydrogen peroxide reached 85.3%. Moreover, the 3D printed TS-1 monolith maintained high catalytic performance over 5 reusable cycles, which solved the problem that traditional catalysts are difficult to be manufactured, separated, and recycled, and presented considerable prospects in reactions requiring fluid agitation.

AB Mechanical metamaterials have garnered significant interests due to their unique properties, which arise from the periodic structures of their constituent units. However, traditional mechanical metamaterials suffer from limitations of fixed properties of the constituent units or irreversibility if they are damaged or little-to-no recyclability. Addressing this challenge, herein, a photoresin consisting of a monomer synthesized from a renewable biomass-epoxidized soybean oil (ESO)-citric acid (CA) and other components was developed for light-based 3D printing. It is discovered that the UV irradiation initiates photopolymerized of the highly photoactive epoxidized soybean oil-ethyl acrylamide (ESO-EA) monomer while enabling the epoxy-acid reaction (EAR) of the epoxy groups in ESO-EA with carboxyl groups in CA to create dynamic chemical bonds (DCBs). This formed dynamic crosslinking network endows the printed material with tunable tensile strengths (0.3-10.4 MPa) and shape memory behaviors (transition temperature: 22-48 degrees C) while maintaining high stretchability (fractural strain: 81 %-205 %). Thermal annealing facilitates dynamic transesterification reactions (DTER) to further improve the mechanical properties while making the printed materials healable and recyclable. By integrating these innovations into liquid crystal display (LCD) based 3D printing, we demonstrate origami metamaterials with tunable, multi-stable mechanical behaviors as well as property recovery after self-healing of the damaged structures by both simulations and experiments. Finally, the printed metamaterials can be recycled with the well-preserved properties.

ID MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; THERMAL-PROPERTIES; FILAMENT
AB Particle size of wood fillers used in FDM 3D printing filaments is a topic not commonly discussed in the literature. Research on traditional wood-polymer composites (WPCs) suggests that bigger particles improve the composite's tensile properties. Is that the case at the 3D printing scale? Five variants of composites were prepared using recycled PLA and sawdust, differentiated by filler particle size (<0.2 mm, 0.2 mm-0.4 mm, 0.4 mm-0.6 mm, 0.6 mm-0.8 mm, 0.8 mm-1 mm). Current draw during extrusion, as well as tensile strength and tensile modulus, were tested. Test results of tensile strength, ranging from 9.21 MPa to 14.28 MPa, and tensile modulus, ranging from 802 MPa to 1014 MPa, have shown no clear correlation between wood particle size and tensile properties of the composites at the 3D printing scale. A clear increase in forces needed to extrude composites containing larger particles of wood was discovered, as well as the inability to extrude composites filled with the biggest tested particle size. To further explore this topic, SEM/EDS imaging of the tested composites was performed. Based on the test results, wood particle sizes ranging from one-fifth to one-half of the nozzle size are recommended for use as fillers in wood-PLA composites intended for 3D printing.

TI Chemical upcycling of commodity thermoset polyurethane foams towards

ID ISOCYANATE
AB Polyurethane thermosets are indispensable to modern life, but their widespread use has become an increasingly pressing environmental burden. Current recycling approaches are economically unattractive and/or lead to recycled products of inferior properties, making their large-scale implementation unviable. Here we report a highly efficient chemical strategy for upcycling thermoset polyurethane foams that yields products of much higher economic values than the original material. Starting from a commodity foam, we show that the polyurethane network is chemically fragmented into a dissolvable mixture under mild conditions. We demonstrate that three-dimensional photo-printable resins with tunable material mechanical properties-which are superior to commercial high-performance counterparts-can be formulated with the addition of various network reforming additives. Our direct upcycling of commodity foams is economically attractive and can be implemented with ease, and the principle can be expanded to other commodity thermosets.
   Current strategies for recycling cross-linked polyurethane foam waste are economically unattractive and/or lead to recycled products with inferior properties. Now it has been shown that a cost-effective chemical strategy can be used to turn the foam into high-performance value-added three-dimensional photo-printing resins.

AB Distributed Recycling via Additive Manufacturing (DRAM) is a closed-loop material reprocessing solution that promotes circular economy. There are several literature gaps related to material properties and recycling cycles at different stages of the DRAM process. With an approach to filling these gaps, a small contribution has been made through this work by comparing the effect of reprocessing cycles (recycling) with the effect of FDM printing parameters such as Raster angle orientation, Infill density and Extrusion Temperature. These four parameters are ranked based on their impact on the tensile properties of Polylactic Acid (PLA) dog bone specimens. The Design of Experiments via Taguchi Analysis is carried out to avoid analysis of a large number of samples. The results show that recycling has the maximum impact on the tensile properties of PLA samples and can reduce the tensile strength by up to 75% in the course of four reprocessing cycles. The specimens had Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS) values in the range of 20-26 MPa at the first reprocessing cycle which dropped significantly to a range of 7-9 MPa after the fourth reprocessing cycle. Additionally, a novel analysis on time and the number of specimens to be 3D printed at each reprocessing stage has also been conducted to help future researchers manage their printing schedule, especially in the recycling domain.

AB Powder material extrusion (PME) additive manufacturing (AM) is a convenient and practical method to study novel materials by circumventing the need for filamentation or compounding of materials. Avoiding additional processing steps can be an enabler for research with exploratory materials or those that otherwise display thermal instabilities. In this work, we present the design, development, and testing of an open-source PME printer. The open-source PME 3D printer achieves print quality on par with commercial material extrusion 3D printers in terms of dimensional accuracy, print quality, and mechanical performance. Additionally, we demonstrate this system to be versatile and robust through printing of recycled materials, polymer composites, polymer blends, and functional polymers with thermally sensitive moieties. The broad range of build materials illustrates the diverse capabilities accessible with this system, which enabled access to properties and functions such as phosphorescence, ferromagnetism, shape memory, and mechanochromism. By improving the accessibility of PME AM and demonstrating its versatility, we hope to enable others to explore novel material systems.

AB 3D printers are marking a new industrial revolution allowing people and companies to create their own usable objects in the real world.
   It is known that additive manufacturing systems are making great progress in all professional areas and that companies are adapting their resources to new technologies.
   With the arrival of the new era, in this case, 3D manufacturing, we can design almost any type of product, with any material, solving the problems characteristic of conventional manufacturing processes.
   With this new technique, we design an object creating its model on the computer and manufacture it, no matter how complex its design. In addition, on-site and on-demand printing means savings in transport and storage costs.
   A single 3D printer is capable of making many different products. Much of the current manufacturing is done with specific machines whose function is limited and if the product changes, the machine must also be readjusted or changed.
   This is why the P.T.M.P. (Printed thermoplastic modular piece), which are constructive modules, which do not allow any vertical wall to be executed within a building.
   One of the main advantages of these pieces is the possibility of using recycled materials in their elaboration, such as plastics, contributing to the sustainability of the planet having special respect and commitment to the environment and making efficient use of material resources.
   In the same way, the non-generation of waste decreases the costs of production in material losses, as well as those derived from the environmental waste plan.

AB Wind power is a quickly growing renewable energy resource within the continental United States and is expected to continue increasing as more wind farms are installed onshore and offshore. As a part of this growth, larger turbines benefit from economies of scale from taller towers. However, the development of ultra-tall wind turbine towers is hindered by transportation restrictions which limit the diameter and weight of the prefabricated tower sections. One proposed solution to this problem is to employ concrete additive manufacturing to build ultra-tall wind turbine towers on-site. To evaluate the potential environmental impacts of this approach, this study per-formed a life cycle assessment comparing four prototype 7.5-MW wind turbine towers designed with a height of 140 m: a conventional tubular steel tower assembled using bolted connections, two 3D printed concrete towers additively manufactured on-site with normal-strength (35 MPa) or high-strength (78 MPa) concrete, and a 3D cast concrete tower with normal strength (35 MPa) concrete cast into concrete formworks additively manu-factured with high-strength (78 MPa) concrete. The 3D cast concrete tower segments are manufactured off-site and assembled on-site. The life cycle assessment examined the impacts of differences in materials inventory, structural designs, manufacturing methods, maintenance schedules, and end-of-life options for the four towers. The results indicate that the material production stage dominates, contributing over 92% of the total CO2 emissions and 67-93% of the energy consumption of the four towers. Compared with the steel tower, the normal-strength 3D printed concrete tower has 23% lower total life cycle CO2 emissions but 29% higher energy con-sumption; the high-strength 3D printed concrete tower has 16% higher life cycle CO2 emissions and 64% higher energy consumption. Parametric studies were also conducted to examine the effects of cement content by weight, distance from the concrete plant to the tower construction site, the number of tower sections, rated tower life, and tower end-of-life recycling rate. The results indicate that reducing cement content in 3D printed concrete such as by incorporating waste or recycled materials can significantly reduce the life cycle environmental im-pacts of ultra-tall turbine towers.

AB Despite the variety of different methods of metal 3D printing on Earth, only a few of them can be realized in space. Processes that employ electron beam as a heat source and wire as a consumable material is among the most promising methods for these applications. But to date, such processes still have not been implemented in actual space operation, mainly due to the low accuracy and resolution of these 3D printed products that require significant post-processing for their intended use. Large and heavy hardware employed in these processes is another significant problem. xBeam 3D Metal Printing is the electron beam DED-wire additive manufacturing technology that has already demonstrated the capability to produce high-quality parts with high productivity on terrestrial relatively lightweight and compact hardware. xBeam process employs a profile electron beam generated by low-voltage gas-discharge electron beam guns combined with the coaxial wire feed to provide excellent control of metallurgy processes in the melt pool and around it during deposition. Realized metallurgy conditions are the crucial factor in providing the combination of high accuracy and resolution with good metal structure and properties. Moreover, maintaining such metallurgy conditions does not require gravity-only cohesion/adhesion forces and surface tension forces are involved. This fact suggests good prospects for using the xBeam 3D Metal Printing in space applications. In addition, the method opens several unique technological opportunities that are important in space exploration, including the nonstick deposition technique allowing the production of "ready-to-use" parts, surface glazing able to substitute machining, recycling of the metal waste directly into wire for 3D printing, and others. The article presents technical solutions for implementing 3D printing and related processes in space conditions and analyzes the metallurgical aspects of the technology using titanium alloy Ti-6Al-4V as an example.

ID WASTE TIRE RUBBER
AB 3D printing technology has emerged as a production method in the past ten years and has attracted great attention in the market. Among various printing systems, digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing has extremely high planar resolution with a smooth sample surface, which is the best advantage of this technology. However, this 3D printing technology currently has three major challenges that urgently need to be improved: (1) the sample has dimensional shrinkage defects after secondary light curing; (2) the mechanical properties of the printed product have a serious tendency to decrease after secondary curing; and (3) the choice of printing materials used lacks diversification. The aforementioned defects will seriously affect the yield of printed products in high-precision manufacturing. In this research, eco-friendly carbon black has been added to the photosensitive resin of DLP to form composites. The mechanical properties of the material, thermogravimetric analysis, material viscosity, surface morphology and size shrinkage were investigated. In the tensile test, the area after the yield point is also significantly prolonged, which indicates better toughness of the composite resins. Adding recycled carbon black to the material can also enhance the heat resistance and thermal stability of the resin without increasing the solution viscosity. The newly synthesized composite resin demonstrated an improved hardness without severe size shrinkage after the post UV curing process, and also provided a new solution to the issue of abandoned tires.

AB The quality of photocure-based 3D printing greatly depends on the properties of the photoresin. There are still many challenges to be overcome at the material level before such additive manufacturing methods dominate the manufacturing industry. To contribute to this exciting re-search, an acrylate-epoxy hybrid and vitrimeric photoresin was studied to reveal the formulation parameters that could be leveraged to obtain improved processability, mechanical performance, and repairability/reprocessability. As the network becomes more lightly or densely crosslinked as a result of changing monomer compositions, or as its components are compatibilized to different extents by varying the types and loadings of the coupling agents, its thermomechanical, tensile, and vitrimeric behaviors are impacted. Using a particular formulation with a high concentration of dynamic beta-hydroxyester linkages, samples are 3D printed and tested for repair and recyclability. When processed at sufficiently high temperatures, transesterification reactions are triggered, allowing for the full recovery of the tensile properties of the repaired or recycled materials, despite their inherently crosslinked structure.

AB Due to the relatively weak adhesion between rubber and the concrete matrix in 3D printed rubber concrete, the mechanical properties of the concrete undergo considerable losses. This study employs solutions of varying concentrations to treat the surface of small particle size rubber (SPSR) through an immersion method, aiming to reduce its hydrophobicity and enhance the strength of 3D printed small particle size rubber concrete (3DPSPSRC). The mechanical properties of 3DP-SPSRC modified with three types of solutions are tested and verified that all three solutions can improve the mechanical properties of the concrete to varying degrees. Among them, the concentrations of the three solutions that yield the best modification effects are as follows: 15 % sodium hydroxide solution (NaOH) for modification, 10 % sulfuric acid solution (H2SO4) for modification, and 5 % potassium permanganate solution (KMnO4) for modification. The improvement range of compressive and flexural strength of 3DP-SPSRC by them is between 4.3 % and 35.93 %. Among the three solutions evaluated, 5 % KMnO4 treatment demonstrates the most significant improvement in mechanical strength. Through comparative analysis of the activation index and contact angle measurements of SPSR before and after modification, it is evident that both parameters exhibit a marked reduction post-treatment, which indicates that the modification processes employed effectively enhance the hydrophilic properties of the rubber. Notably, 5 % KMnO4 modified rubber displays superior hydrophilicity compared to the other treatment conditions. Based on SEM, the micro morphology of the modified rubber is observed and analyzed. The workability and extrudability tests demonstrate that the modified 3DP-SPSRC could be well-suited for the self-developed 3D concrete printer, and the interlayer bond strength is significantly increased by 46.63 %. In this study, recycled rubber powder made from waste tires is added to concrete and applied in 3D printing technology, which alleviates the environmental pressure caused by waste tires. The methods of surface modification of SPSR are explored and verified the feasibility of surface - modifying SPSR to improve the mechanical properties of 3D - printed rubber concrete

AB Fused deposition modelling (FDM) is a promising additive manufacturing technology and an alternative of conventional processes for the fabrication of fibre reinforced composites due to its ability to build functional parts having complex geometries. Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastic composites (CFRTPCs) are becoming more significant in industrial applications due to their inherit advantages such as excellent mechanical performance, recycling and potential lightweight structures [1,2]. However, a major concern affecting the efficient use of 3D printed composites is the effect of impact damage on the structural integrity, compared to conventional pre-preg composites. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of build orientation, layer thickness and fibre volume content on the impact performance of 3D printed continuous carbon, glass, and Kevlar fibre reinforced nylon composites, manufactured by FDM technique. Charpy impact tests are carried out to determine impact strength. SEM images of fractured surfaces are examined to assess failure mechanics of the different configurations.
   It is observed that the effect of layer thickness of nylon samples on the impact performance was different for flat and on-edge samples. Impact strength increases as layer thickness increases in flat samples but, conversely, it decreases in on-edge samples, depicting a more brittle fracture. In addition, the results show that impact strength increases as fibre volume content increases in most cases. Glass fibre reinforced samples exhibits the highest impact strength and carbon fibre reinforced samples the lowest one and similar to nylon performance. Furthermore, on-edge reinforced samples exhibit higher values of impact strength than flat reinforced samples. Finally, the results obtained demonstrate that impact strength exhibited by 3D printed composites are significantly higher than the usual 3D printed thermoplastics and, in some cases, even better than common pre-preg materials.

AB In the present study, a series of carbon-based nanocomposites based on recycled thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) matrix and MWCNT fillers synthesized in a laboratory environment were prepared at various loadings and assessed in terms of their functional thermal, dielectric, and rheological properties, as well as their ohmic heating capability, for self-healing applications in extrusion-based 3D printing technologies. The synthesis of nanomaterials focused on the production of two different types of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. A comparative assessment and benchmarking were conducted with nanocomposite filaments obtained from commercial nanomaterials and masterbatches with MWCNTs. For all the polymer nanocomposites, samples were prepared at additive contents up to 15 wt.% and filament feedstock was produced via the melt-extrusion process for 3D printing; these were previously characterized by rheological tests. The measurements of thermal and electrical conductivity resulted in a selected composition with promising ohmic heating capability. As a preliminary assessment of the self-healing ability of the above samples, artificial cracks were introduced on the surface of the samples and SEM analysis took place at the crack location before and after applying voltage as a measure of the effectiveness of the material remelting due to the Joule effect. Results indicate a promising material response with a partial restoration of artificial cracks.

AB This study investigates the impact of varying steel fiber (SF) content (0%, 0.8%, 1.0%, and 1.2% by volume) on the mechanical and durability properties of 3D-printed Ca(OH)2-activated geopolymer concrete (GPC). The addition of 1.2% SF improved flexural strength by 69% at 7 days and 16% at 28 days, while tensile strength more than doubled to 3.75 MPa at 28 days. Although compressive strength remained unaffected at 43 MPa, SF enhanced interlayer bond strength by 20%, which is crucial for layer cohesion in 3D-printed structures. Additionally, the elastic modulus increased by 7%, contributing to improved stiffness. Durability assessments, including autogenous shrinkage and self-induced stress, indicated a slight reduction in shrinkage of SF-reinforced samples, with no significant effect on self-induced stress. Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray micro-computed tomography (mu CT) demonstrated the crack-bridging behavior of steel fibers, enhancing ductility and fracture resistance. There was a slight increase in porosity (5.34%) of SF-reinforced samples without negatively affecting their mechanical properties. Notably, SF improved early-age toughness and controlled crack propagation across printed layers, addressing a critical challenge in 3D-printed concrete. The novelty of this work lies in successfully reinforcing 3D-printed Ca(OH)2-activated GPC with recycled steel fibers, enhancing mechanical properties, interlayer bonding, and durability without compromising printability. This study offers a sustainable reinforcement strategy for 3D printing in construction.

AB The transformation of plastic waste into valuable products remains a significant challenge for sustainable manufacturing. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), a melt extrusion-based additive manufacturing (AM) technique, has emerged as a promising solution for repurposing waste thermoplastics. However, multiple recycling cycles introduce substantial changes in material properties, limiting their mechanical performance and surface quality. Despite ongoing research efforts, FDM-printed components still lag behind conventionally manufactured parts in terms of mechanical integrity, microstructure, and overall durability. Additionally, while the use of recycled plastics in FDM has been explored, a structured literature review focusing on the development of functional and customized products from recycled waste is still lacking. To address this gap, the present study provides a comprehensive review of the utilization of recycled plastic waste in FDM-based 3D printing, emphasizing the role of reinforced materials in enhancing performance. It examines the effects of processing conditions on the properties of recycled FDM components and explores the incorporation of diverse additives to improve material quality. Furthermore, this review presents two case studies from the existing literature that demonstrate the successful integration of thermoplastic waste into FDM-based manufacturing. By identifying existing limitations and potential research directions, this study aims to contribute to the advancement of sustainable and circular manufacturing practices through FDM technology.

AB The interfacial solar desalination has been considered a promising method to address the worldwide water crisis without sophisticated infrastructures and additional energy consumption. Although various advanced solar evaporators have been developed, their practical applications are still restricted by the unsustainable materials and the difficulty of precise customization for structure to escort high solar -thermal efficiency. To address these issues, we employed two kinds of naturally occurring molecules, tan-nic acid and iron (III), to construct a low-cost, highly efficient and durable interfacial solar evaporator by three-dimensional (3D) printing. Based on a rational structural design, a robust and 3D-printed evapora-tor with conical array surface structure was developed, which could promote the light harvesting capac-ity significantly via the multiple reflections and anti-reflection effects on the surface. By optimizing the height of the conical arrays, the 3D-printed evaporator with tall-cone structure could achieve a high evaporation rate of 1.96 kg m-2 h-1 under one sun illumination, with a photothermal conversion effi-ciency of 94.4%. Moreover, this evaporator was also proved to possess excellent desalination perfor-mance, recycle stability, anti-salt property, underwater oil resistance, as well as adsorption capacity of organic dye contaminants for multipurpose water purification applications. It was believed that this study could provide a new strategy to fabricate low-cost, structural regulated solar evaporators for alle-viating the dilemma of global water scarcity using abundant naturally occurring building blocks.

AB In the context of seeking sustainable solutions for developing innovative materials and products by an efficient use of natural resources and recycling waste, with an increasing focus on circular economy and mitigating environmental impact, the presents research aims to use biomass and agricultural residues as raw materials for bio composite production. Specifically, valorizing European hazelnut waste presents a unique opportunity to devise innovative formulations for 3D printing, leveraging both the mechanical properties and aesthetic appeal of lignocellulosic bio composites. In detail, this work aimed at the investigation of new poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/ Hazelnut Shell Powder formulations for 3D printing design applications exploiting the woody aesthetic effect of these bio composites. A pellet 3D printer was used to bypass the filament production. Three different Hazelnut Shell Powder content (from 10 up to 30 wt%) were investigated and a design of experiment was carried out to generate response surfaces able to identify the best printing conditions to optimize flexural, tensile and impact properties. Finally, the effect of three different raster angles (0(degrees),+/- 45(degrees) and 90(degrees)) on the mechanical properties was investigated. The best configuration was: 220 C-degrees of nozzle temperature, 25 mm/s of printing speed and +/- 45(degrees) of raster angle. With this configuration, prototypes of ornamental pots, jewellery and home furniture were produced as demonstrators.

AB Recycling of usable resources from waste must be prioritized to adhere to the circular economy policy implemented worldwide. This study aims to use wastewater sludge incineration ash (WSIA), which is a by-product of wastewater sludge treatment processes, in the 3D printing industry as a sustainable material. First, we explored the stability of incinerated ash generated from a wastewater treatment facility in Seoul by evaluating its physical (water content, organic matter content, and particle size) and chemical (oxide compound composition) characteristics. Composition ratios of the predominant oxides of silicon (SiO2), aluminum (Al2O3), phosphorous (P2O5), iron (Fe2O3), and calcium (CaO) were stable for 6 months. This finding indicates the potential for the incinerated ash to be commercially viable as a powder-bed 3D printed geopolymer. We then examined the optimal ratio of admixtures between the incinerated ash and ultrarapid hardening cement and the following post-treatment process method as a curing stage. The composite material made with 25% WSIA exhibited stability during the curing stage using alkaline solutions, and its compressive strength and water absorption were in accordance with the values recommended by the Korean Standard for decorative concrete blocks (KS F 4038). Additionally, a geopolymer prototype with 25% incinerated ash was produced. To support efficient upcycling of WSIA, long-term environmental and functional monitoring of the final product, effects of incinerated ash particle sizes, and post-treatment process times were further investigated to reduce costs.

AB Phosphorus removal is a key technology to avoid water eutrophication. However, due to the relatively weak activity of phosphorous compounds, it is still a challenge to recycle them efficiently. In this paper, a 3D-printed acetylacetone-coordinating one-pot sol-gel strategy was proposed to prepare hybrid zirconia hydrogels with relatively high zeta potential (positive even when pH value reaches 8.0), high specific surface area (272.66 m2 g-1) and loose pore structure (average pore size is 5.97 nm). The adsorption experimental results showed that zirconia hydrogels had excellent phosphate adsorption performance, and the maximum adsorption capacity was 209.64 mg g-1. The most valuable thing was that the hydrogels still maintained a very high adsorption capacity (142.00 mg g-1) in a neutral environment. Zirconia hybrid hydrogel has higher surface potential (13.5 mV, pH = 6) and larger mesoporous structure (most probable pore size = 7.3 nm) than zirconia nanoparticles (5 mV, pH = 6; most probable pore size = 3.5 nm), which are beneficial to mass transfer, adsorption ability, and ultimately, excellent adsorption performance. Surprisingly, the zirconium-based hydrogel can realize 3D printing through ink direct writing technology, which endowed the block hydrogels with stable and macroscopical structure. The zirconia-based hydrogels constructed by 3D printing had a faster phosphate adsorption rate than the undesigned block hydrogels, and they were easier to recover than powdered adsorbents. The sol-gel and 3D printing strategy in this paper may provide a new idea for the optimal design of phosphate adsorbent for direct water treatment.

AB In this study, 3D printed polylactic acid (PLA) objects were recycled into lactide monomers using various commercially available catalysts, including triazabicyclodecene (TBD), tin (II) ethylhexanoate; Sn(Oct)2 and titanium (IV) isopropoxide; Ti(OiPr)4. The PLA objects were first dissolved in dichloromethane and then processed into catalyst embedded films or electrospun fibers. The degradation of PLA was performed under both static air and nitrogen flow conditions, demonstrating that electrospun fibers with 0.5 % mol catalyst loadings exhibited superior degradation performance compared to films. For instance, the electrospun fibers with Sn(Oct)2 catalyst achieved a turnover frequency (TOF) of 3400 h-1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and degradation constant (kobs) calculations confirmed that the fibers had a significantly higher degradation rate due to their increased surface area and better catalyst distribution. The isolation of L-lactic acid (L-LA) from the degradation products was achieved with an average yield of 95 %, indicating the effectiveness of the recycling process. This research highlights the potential for efficient PLA recycling using catalyst-embedded electrospun fibers, offering a sustainable approach to polymer waste management.

AB Three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP) is advancing rapidly, yet its sustainable adoption requires alignment with circular-economy principles. This study evaluates the substitution of natural aggregates with recycled constituents, 3DCP waste, brick debris, glass cullet, mixed rubble, fly ash, and slag, and the use of lightweight fillers (expanded perlite, lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA), and expanded polystyrene (EPS)) to reduce density and improve insulation. Key properties, such as particle-size distribution, printability, mechanical performance, thermal conductivity, and water absorption, were determined. Results indicate that grading strongly affected mixture behavior. Narrow distributions (fly ash, milled 3DCP waste) enhanced extrudability, while broader gradings (glass, rubble, slag) increased water demand and extrusion risks. Despite these differences, all systems remained within the printable window: flow spread decreased with most recycled additions (lowest for brick) and increased with glass. Mechanical responses were composition-dependent. Flexural strength typically decreased. Compressive strength benefited from broader gradings, with replacement levels up to similar to 6% enhancing strength due to improved packing. Loading anisotropy typical of 3DCP was observed, with perpendicular compressive strength reaching up to 13% higher values than parallel loading. Lightweight fillers significantly reduced thermal conductivity. LECA provided the best compromise between strength and insulation, perlite showed intermediate behavior, and EPS achieved the lowest thermal conductivity but induced significant strength penalties due to weak matrix-EPS interfaces. Water absorption decreased in recycled-aggregate mixes, whereas lightweight systems, particularly with perlite, retained higher uptake. The results demonstrate that non-reactive recycled aggregates and lightweight insulating fillers can be successfully integrated into extrusion-based 3DCP without compromising printability.

AB Due to the significant properties of silica, thermostatics can be enhanced using silica-additives to maximize the quality of polymer compounds and transform plastics into tailored properties. The silica additives can enhance the handling and quality performance of composites and thermoplastic polymers due to their diverse potential. Besides, using silica as an additive in different characteristics can allow granulates and powders to flow easily, minimize caking, and control rheology. On the other hand, the eruption of 3D printing technology has led to a massive new waste source of plastics, especially the polylactic acid (PLA) that is associated with the fused deposition modeling (FDM) process. In this paper, the impact on the mechanical properties when silica is mixed with waste PLA from 3D printing was studied. The PLA/silica mixtures were prepared using different blends through twin extruders and a Universal Testing Machine was used for the mechanical characterization. The result indicated that increasing silica composition resulted in the increase of the tensile strength to 121.03 MPa at 10 wt%. Similar trends were also observed for the toughness, ductility, and the yield stress values of the PLA/silica blends at 10 wt%, which corresponds to the increased mechanical property of the composite material reinforced by the silica particles. Improvement in the mechanical properties of the developed composite material promotes the effective recycling of PLA from applications such as 3D printing and the potential of reusing it in the same application.

AB Two new vitrimeric materials have been studied for potential additive manufacturing applications such as 3Dprinting. A monomer containing disulfide bonds and beta-hydroxyesters was easily synthesized from two lowcost and commercially available reagents. Another disulfide-containing monomer was synthesized for comparison purposes. Materials were prepared through a UV-light radical polymerization of methacrylates. The addition of two reactive diluents such as poly(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) and ethylene glycol phenyl ether methacrylate (EGPMA) was necessary to achieve a suitable viscosity for the curing as well as for their printability. The curing process was controlled by FTIR. Thermomechanical properties were investigated by means of DMTA analysis revealing near-ambient T-g values. Stress relaxation tests revealed that both materials were capable to relax the 63% of the initial stress in less than 10 min at 110( degrees)C. The recyclability of the materials was achieved, and the mechanical and thermomechanical properties of the recycled samples were compared to the virgin ones revealing a great recovery of the initial properties. Finally, Digital Light Processing (DLP) technique was used to print complex structures with high resolution highlighting the great potential of these vitrimeric materials in 3D printing.

AB Lipase immobilization with hydrophobic interaction is of interesting exploration, and some functionalized groups on supports are special for activity increasing. To achieved a good performance of costeffective immobilization on macro-supports for feasible usage and recycle, eco-friendly PLA-based 3D printing macro-scaffolds with fabrication was designed, and phenyl groups with different length of linkers and combined two kinds of groups were anchored for lipase YCJ01 binding with improving payload, the highest enzyme expression of 2227.5 U/g, activity recovery of 137.3%, and increasing specific activity of 815.9 U/mg were attained by using PLA@AMTS-C7-Ph/PLA@AMTS-C9-Ph scaffolds as carries. The immobilized lipase YCJ01 on bifunctionalized 3D printing scaffolds was further applied to the efficient resolution of racemic 1-indanol (267 mM) with high stereoselectivity using a binary solvent system. The immobilized lipase YCJ01 could control the over transesterification of (S)-1-indanol and exhibit good operational stability of repetitive usage for 9 cycles. This is beneficial to obtain the high enantiomerical pure product by feasible separation of immobilized biocatalyst without rigorous operation.

ID EMBODIED ENERGY; LOW-CARBON; FABRICATION
AB In recent years, the potential of earth materials in construction has emerged as a sustainable pathway, offering environmental benefits compared to traditional methods. When used in raw form, earth materials can be recycled at the end of a building life, reducing construction waste. In parallel, integrating additive manufacturing into the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) sector has brought about a shift in construction dynamics, combining efficiency with precision. This paper bridges the study of 3D printing with earth-based fresh mortars, emphasising the capabilities of the "Forced Layer Drying" (FLD) technique in the additive manufacturing process to increase the mechanical performance of the printing mortar. This paper begins by defining the requisite rheological properties for successful 3D printing. A chosen material for this paper is Speswhite kaolin. An instrumental aspect of our research is exploring an established model for the drying rate of saturated porous media, such as earth and concrete, and its application to predict the evaporation rate of saturated earth-based mortar in 3D printing with forced drying conditions. The Wind Tunnel experiment was conducted to validate this model, examining the interplay of airflow speed and temperature on the evaporation rate. Further deepening this study, the soil water content and undrained shear strength are correlated, specifically based on models derived from oedometer geotechnical standard tests. This facilitated a comprehensive understanding of porous earth-based materials in various moisture scenarios. Our findings confirm that airflow, temperature, and the geometry of the printed object play instrumental roles in affecting evaporation rate, consequent mechanical performance, and structural build-up of the material. The paper wraps up by offering insights into the practical application of 3D printing using earth-based mortars, with a special focus on FLD technique.

AB This study investigated the 3D printing feasibility of mono-material facade panels with recycled thermoplastic. The design had integrated performance parameters, namely air permeability, water tightness, resistance to wind loads, and impact resistance, and fabrication parameters in a computational iterative process to inform the geometry topology. The fabrication parameters were integrated and evaluated for geometry accuracy, print path accuracy of 5 mm length, overhang higher than 45 degrees, inner layer adhesion, and adhesion to the print bed. Two panels, measuring 1.6-m length and 2-m height, and six connections were fabricated and evaluated in a standardized facade testing rig. The air permeability displayed a larger than 1.5 m3/m2 & sdot;h permissible Class 1 value due to air gaps in the manufactured panels. The same gaps that occurred during the fabrication process permitted water flow in both panels after 7 min of testing. The panels passed standardized serviceability and safety standards for wind load resistance and achieved a maximum E5 class for impact resistance. The structural strength values were 1500 Pa for serviceability, 2250 Pa for safety load, and 3262 Pa for breaking load. These findings demonstrated that 3D-printed geometries have a high potential to facilitate sustainable design strategies by integrating multiple performances within a mono-material building envelope.

AB In this study, material development, characterization, and sustainability assessment are performed on blends from recycled post-consumer commodity plastics for fused deposition modeling (FDM) filament extrusion. A recycled polyethylene terephthalate (rPET) and high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) blend 80:20 ratio is modified using three different methods: compatibilization with Maleic Anhydride, surface functionalization of PET with sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), and hybridization by combination of the two methods which is a novel approach. The selected blends were reinforced with chopped glass fibers and characterized. The printability of blends was assessed, and the dimensional accuracy of the prints was calculated. In addition, a cost estimation and comparison between the developed blends and the commercially available FDM filaments was carried out. Finally, life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted for each prepared blend to facilitate the decision of the optimum blend in relation to mechanical properties and environmental performance and hence correlate the material, economic, and sustainability advantages.

AB Automated construction process with extrusion-based 3D concrete printing (3DCP) is widely recognised due to its ability to construct complex freeform geometrical shapes. Furthermore, the automation process reduces labour and minimises material wastage, thus improving productivity. The structural performance of printed structures has been widely discussed; however, addressing the knowledge gap in energy performance and their environmental impact needs further investigation. Thus, this study investigated and compared the insulation characteristics, life cycle cost and environmental impact assessment of 3DCP structures with traditional reinforced concrete members. The evaluation of the insulation properties of 3D printable concrete allows the characterisation of operational costs and greenhouse gas emissions incurred from the additional heating and cooling systems. Furthermore, this study also suggested a method to enhance the thermal resistance of 3DCP with recycled fibre recovered from face mask waste. A comparison between face mask fibre-reinforced 3D-printed wall element and conventional reinforced concrete wall is also performed across the thermal, life cycle cost and environmental impact parameters. The results showed that the insulation properties of 3DCP walls were increased by 49.5% with the addition of face mask fibres compared to RC walls. This results in reduced energy consumption from additional heating and cooling systems along with a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, thereby improving the energy performance of the building. Further, face mask fibre-reinforced printed walls showed a reduction in the life cycle cost, mainly in the operation stage, due to the low labour requirement and elimination of formwork. Moreover, a significant reduction in the depletion of resources and ozone depletion was observed for 3DCP face mask fibre-reinforced walls, along with the reduced impact on human health and ecosystem damage. Consequently, the incorporation of face mask fibres into the 3DCP process paves the way for its potential in constructing energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable buildings.

AB To promote the construction industry and establish a green environment, the integration of sustainable building materials is urgently required. This study presents the influences of three materials (silica fume, fly ash, and recycled ceramic powder (RCP)) and different RCP dosages (0%, 10%, 20%, and 30%) on the mechanical properties and microstructure of concrete at different temperatures. The study presents the results of comprehensive flow tests, printability assessments, mechanical evaluations under different loading directions, hightemperature analyses, digital image correlation, X-ray powder diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The experimental findings indicate the successful printing of all samples, with wall structure failure occurring only at a height of 730 mm. Furthermore, compared to those of other materials, the RCP displays a superior heat resistance, with a significant increase in compressive strength (28.9%) to 53.9 MPa at 300 degrees C. Additionally, the introduction of the RCP into 3D -printed concrete results in an anisotropic behaviour, with an initial enhancement in the mechanical strength, followed by attenuation as the RCP content increases. Microstructural analysis reveals enhanced interfacial adhesion with RCP addition, albeit accompanied by the emergence of numerous pores. The optimal mixture, which is designated as RCP -2-0-1 with 20% of the cement replaced by RCP, exhibits a significant anisotropic compressive strength (55.9 MPa) and an adequate anisotropic flexural strength (12.49 MPa) and impressive heat resistance (11.7% increase in compressive strength at 300 degrees C). This renders it a suitable sustainable impact -resistant thermal material for use in structural applications.

AB Traditional lost wax-based investment casting (IC) is an established process to prepare dental crowns (DC), scaffolds, implants, etc. for both human and veterinary patients. But hitherto, little has been reported on the use of direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) waste (support material) for the fabrication of DC as functional prototypes. This study highlights the fabrication of DC for canine's strategic teeth (ST) by IC of 17-4 precipitate hardened stainless steel and Ni-based alloys (collected support structure used in DMLS). The DC master pattern for ST with different geometries (volume (V)/surface area (A) ratios) was printed on fused deposition modeling by using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene filament with input parameters such as infill pattern (IP), infill density, layer height. The printed master patterns were post-processed (PP) before IC. The response parameters, namely microhardness (HV), peak load (PL), surface roughness (Ra), and dimensional deviation (Delta t) were optimized by using Taguchi L-18 orthogonal array. Results outlined that for Ra of cast DC, material composition (MC), V/A ratio, and PP are significant parameters. For HV, PL, and Delta t the significant parameters are MC, IP, and PP, respectively. The results are supported by photomicrographs, porosity, and thermal stability analysis.

AB Digital light processing (DLP) is a projection-based vat photopolymerization 3D printing technique that attracts increasing attention due to its high resolution and accuracy. The projection-based layer-by-layer deposition in DLP uses precise light control to cure photopolymer resin quickly, providing a smooth surface finish due to the uniform layer curing process. Additionally, the extensive material selection in DLP 3D printing, notably including existing photopolymerizable materials, presents a significant advantage compared with other 3D printing techniques with limited material choices. Studies in DLP can be categorized into two main domains: material-level and system-level innovation. Regarding material-level innovations, the development of photocurable resins with tailored rheological, photocuring, mechanical, and functional properties is crucial for expanding the application prospects of DLP technology. In this review, we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art advancements in DLP 3D printing, focusing on material innovations centered on functional materials, particularly various smart materials for 4D printing, in addition to piezoelectric ceramics and their composites with their applications in DLP. Additionally, we discuss the development of recyclable DLP resins to promote sustainable manufacturing practices. The state-of-the-art system-level innovations are also delineated, including recent progress in multi-materials DLP, grayscale DLP, AI-assisted DLP, and other related developments. We also highlight the current challenges and propose potential directions for future development. Exciting areas such as the creation of photocurable materials with stimuli-responsive functionality, ceramic DLP, recyclable DLP, and AI-enhanced DLP are still in their nascent stages. By exploring concepts like AI-assisted DLP recycling technology, the integration of these aspects can unlock significant opportunities for applications driven by DLP technology. Through this review, we aim to stimulate further interest and encourage active collaborations in advancing DLP resin materials and systems, fostering innovations in this dynamic field.

AB Concrete exhibits inherently low ductility and tensile strength despite its high compressive strength. Typically, it must be reinforced with steel rebars, yet it still suffers from potential corrosion issues. This work proposes and examines a new method for improving the bending stiffness of cementitious beams by reinforcing with 3D printed plastic TPMS-Primitive scaffolds. Three concrete beams of the same size - including non-reinforced, reinforced with one-layer, and two-layer bioinspired thin-walled molds - are designed and fabricated for three-point bending tests and comparisons. The simulation is found to be in good agreement with the experiment in terms of stress-strain curves and crack propagation. Results show the improved load-bearing capacity of the concrete beam reinforced with 3D-printed TPMS-Primitive shells. The peak load of the two-layer TPMS-Primitive reinforced beam is 35% and 125% higher than that of the one-layer reinforced beam and the non-reinforced concrete beam, respectively. Furthermore, the TPMS-Primitive reinforced concrete beams reveal a smooth softening behavior in bending and increase ductility as well. The scalable and sustainable production of such beams for construction applications could be realized by a combination of 3D printing techniques and recycled plastic.

AB Sustainability aims to meet the demands of the present generation as well as improve the quality of life, develop the economy, conserve resources, and protect the environment for the future generations. Additive manufacturing is one of the techniques to achieve sustainability in manufacturing. Life cycle assessment is a useful tool to ensure viability and applicability of new technology and assess whether it offers tangible benefits compared to conventional methods. There is hardly any comparative study on the life cycle assessment of the widely used filament materials.
   This research compares the environmental impacts of widely used filament materials (PLA, ABS, and PETG) for a 3D printed product from cradle to cradle that includes four phases: raw material extraction, production, use and recycling. Environmental impacts and hotspots in terms of both endpoint and midpoint categories have been estimated. The research provides decision support for stakeholders to compare the environmental impacts of different materials and accordingly select the most environmentally friendly material.

AB The current techniques used for strengthening existing buildings made out of masonry infilled frames are characterized by high impact on the daily internal activities, as people living or working in the building need to move out while the retrofitting activities take place. The seismic vulnerability of infilled concrete frames is related to their high stiffness that, being due to the presence of masonry infills, induces a very brittle failure mechanism. The available retrofitting techniques do not allow to decrease the frames stiffness without making demolitions, especially for what concerns the double layer infills, a typology that characterizes a large part of the Italian buildings built from 1970s. For such infills only traditional techniques are available, mostly lime/cement-based mortars strengthened with various fibers that increase the frame stiffness. This study proposes an innovative technique for the out-of-plane strengthening of masonry double layer infills. The system is based on a 3D printed system made of recycled plastic, placed between the two masonry layers composing the infill and acts: i) triggering preferential in-plane sliding surfaces for reducing stiffness and therefore damaging, ii) warranting out-of-plane stability avoiding the snap-through mechanism, iii) ensuring low environmental impact by using recycled materials and, iv) no disrupting the daily internal activities. The full scale out of plane test is carried out on an infill specimen previously damaged in the in plane direction, by using a hydraulic jack placed at mid-height of the infill. The experimental results are compared with analytical models available in literature combined with a model specifically developed for the resistant mechanism provided by the plastic devices. The obtained results suggest that plastic joints are effective in preventing instability and can be used as effective strengthening system for concrete frames with masonry infills.

AB As an abundant commodity, coffee production generates significant scraps and by-products, increasing the potential pollution hazards. Circular economy and bioeconomy can help valorize Spent Coffee Grounds (SCGs), e.g., as fillers in polymer-based composites using conventional manufacturing, i.e., injection molding. Large-format additive manufacturing with pellet extruders offers a further option for new applications, reducing costs for the valorization of biomass waste. However, its use in this context remains unexplored, especially for applications with complex geometries or critical overhangs. This work investigates new biomass waste-based materials for large-format additive manufacturing with direct feeding extrusion, fabricating self-supported complex overhang geometries through nonplanar slicing. The thermal, rheological, and mechanical properties of three novel polymer-based pellet compounds with post-industrial SCGs, i.e., injection molding grade polylactic acid/SCGs, recycled low-density polyethylene/SCGs, and high-density polyethylene/SCGs, were herein investigated to evaluate their printability, defining their extrusion temperatures (190 degrees C and 170 degrees C). Results showed suitable viscosity ranges (133.6-839.7 Pa center dot s) and accurate tensile values comparable with literature, e.g., similar to 1-3% minimum relative standard deviations (polylactic acid/SCGs), or conventional manufacturing, e.g., elastic moduli of 107.4 MPa (recycled low-density polyethylene/SCGs) and 587 MPa (high-density polyethylene/SCGs). Their use with large-format 3D printers was assessed thanks to nonplanar samples with complex overhang geometries, reaching a maximum curvature angle of 32 degrees and fabricating overhangs up to 25 degrees without supports. According to the tests, especially polylactic acid/SCGs, a bio-based compound, and recycled low-density polyethylene/SCGs, a fully recycled material, can be used for large-format 3D printing applications with complex geometries, e.g., furniture, interior, and exhibition design. This work paves the way for new materials for large-format additive manufacturing, reducing the need for 3D printing grade feedstock, cutting costs and consumption from filament processing, and fostering material waste reduction practices.

AB Over the past 40 years, global plastic production has increased twenty-fold, prompting efforts to mitigate plastic waste. Recycling has emerged as the predominant strategy for sustainable plastic waste management. As additive manufacturing (AM) continues to evolve, integrating recycled plastics with various additives has gained significant attention. This systematic literature review, conducted in full accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, aims to evaluate and compare the properties and effects of recycled plastics and their additives in AM. Specifically, it examines the thermal, mechanical, and rheological properties of these materials, along with their life cycle environmental and economic implications. A total of 88 research publications, spanning from 2013 to 2023, were analyzed. The databases searched include Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Google Scholar, with the final search conducted in December 2023. Studies were selected through a four-stage process-identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion-based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The risk of bias was assessed using five criteria: credibility, scope, clarity, methodology, and analysis quality. The results show that most research focuses on the mechanical properties of recycled plastics, with significant gaps in understanding their thermal and rheological properties. Additionally, there is limited research on the environmental and economic viability of these materials, highlighting the need for integrated life cycle assessments and eco-efficiency analyses. This review offers additive manufacturing professionals a comprehensive understanding of the thermal, mechanical, and rheological performance of recycled plastics and additives, supporting efforts to improve sustainability in the industry.

AB Plastic pollution has emerged as a significant global issue, highlighting the need for sustainable alternatives and effective recycling methods. Concurrently, the cactus plant offers a promising source of bio-based materials, particularly due to its resilience in harsh environments. This study focused on the performance characterization of cactus powder mixed with recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) pellets for filament production suitable for 3D printing using the Fused Filament Fabrication method. The physical properties of both cactus and rHDPE were investigated, and composite filaments were prepared from 5%, 10%, and 15% cactus powder alongside rHDPE. Performance evaluation of the composite filaments was conducted using a Universal Testing Machine. Additionally, the chemical composition of cactus powder was analyzed, and the particle size distribution was determined. The combination of HDPE pellets and cactus powder yielded a viable filament, though increasing proportions of cactus reduced the extrusion properties. The tensile strength of pure rHDPE filament was measured at 16.27 MPa, while the tensile strengths for the 5% and 10% cactus composites were 14.97 and 10.74 MPa, respectively. For the printed specimens, the tensile strength was recorded at 13.04 MPa for rHDPE and 8.28 MPa for the 5% cactus composite. The flexural strength results showed 21.77 MPa for rHDPE and 15.64 MPa for the 5% cactus composite. These findings suggest that cactus powder can serve as a valuable additive in developing sustainable 3D printing materials.

AB A vanillin-based photocurable resin was designed for circularity by incorporation of imine functionalities through a Schiff-base reaction between the aldehyde function of vanillin and amino group of ethylene diamine. Sufficient flexibility was provided by a short aliphatic segment introduced by reaction of vanillin with ethylene carbonate, while photocurability was obtained by subsequent methacrylation. The cured thermoset had good solvent resistance, relatively high glass transition temperature (similar to 75 degrees C) and good thermal stability with an onset of degradation above 300 degrees C. Due to the crosslinked structure and imine linkages, the thermoset expressed malleability, self-healing and thermal reprocessability. Furthermore, it could be chemically recycled by immersing in ethylene diamine, which activated transimination. The obtained oligomeric product with amineterminal groups could be utilized for production of new thermoset films. Tensile testing illustrated similar elastic modulus for mechanically and chemically recycled thermosets, while a slight increase was observed for the self-healed samples, ascribable to a completion of the curing during the post-processing. At the same time elongation and stress at break slightly decreased. Finally, the suitability of the resin for the production of 3D objects by means of digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing was demonstrated.

AB Short carbon fiber-reinforced bio-based polyamide 11 (PA11) composites were developed in filament form for Additive Fusion Technology (AFT) 3D printing and benchmarked against injection-molded samples. Composites containing 15 and 25 weight percent (wt%) recycled carbon fibers (rCFs) were successfully extruded into 1.75 mm diameter filaments, whereas higher fiber contents (35 wt%) led to brittle filament failure. AFT printing with subsequent consolidation produced short fiber composites with highly aligned fibers, while injection molding generated more randomly oriented microstructures. Mechanical testing revealed that AFT-printed composites in the fiber direction achieved significantly higher stiffness and comparable tensile strength to injection-molded counterparts. At 25 wt% fiber content, AFT 0 degrees specimens reached an axial tensile modulus of 14.5 GPa, about 32% higher than injection-molded samples (11.0 GPa), with similar axial tensile strength (similar to 123 vs. 126 MPa). However, AFT specimens displayed pronounced anisotropy: transverse (90 degrees) properties dropped to similar to 2.3 GPa for transverse modulus and similar to 46-50 MPa transverse tensile strength, near matrix-dominated levels. Impact testing showed orientation-dependent toughness, with AFT 90 degrees samples at 15% fiber content achieving the highest impact energy (76 kJ.m(-2)), while AFT 0 degrees samples were similar to 30% lower than injection-molded equivalents. Dynamic mechanical analysis confirmed that AFT 0 degrees composites maintained higher stiffness up to similar to 80 degrees C. Overall, these results demonstrate that aligned short fiber filaments enable high stiffness and strength performance comparable to injection molding, with the trade-off of anisotropy that must be carefully considered in design. This study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of combining bio-based PA11 with recycled short carbon fibers in AFT printing, thereby extending additive manufacturing to sustainable and high-stiffness short fiber composites.

AB Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) have the potential to combine the excellent mechanical properties of traditional thermoset materials with the reprocessability of traditional thermoplastics. However, the processing of CANs using common techniques for thermoplastics has proven challenging. In this work, the 3D printing of reprocessable CANs with controlled shape is reported using vat photopolymerization (VP). Using a vinylogous urethane-containing methacrylic cross-linker, a series of resins containing nonreactive and reactive diluents are described. The resin viscosity can be easily tuned by the relative amount of diluent to functional cross-linker such that the viscosity of commercial resins can be easily achieved. By studying the curing kinetics using Jacob's equation, optimal printing conditions are found that allow for high-resolution printing with limited shrinkage. In addition, due to the presence of dynamic bonds in the final material, it is shown that the final printed piece can be reprocessed at high temperatures and can even be recycled into a second-generation resin that can be reprinted.

AB Cementitious materials incorporating recycled crumb rubber have become a common sustainable resolution in diverse building environments to achieve various functions in terms of lightweight, ductility, as well as energy absorption. This study explored the 3D printed rubberised cementitious composites (3DPRC) in two aspects: examining the effects of crumb rubber pretreatment conditions on compressive properties; conducting experimental and numerical analysis on the acoustic dissipation characteristics of 3DPRC. Fine crumb rubber granules (3-5 mm) replaced 10%, 20%, and 30% of river sand in the composites. Uniaxial compression tests indicated that the compressive strength of 3DPRC decreased with the increase of crumb rubber content and introduced anisotropic behaviour. Impedance tube tests were conducted to evaluate the sound absorption and insulation capabilities of 3DPRC. An optimal Noise Reduction Coefficient (NRC) of 0.35 was achieved with 30% crumb rubber. The sound insulation properties depend strongly on the mass density and porosity of the 3DPRC. Additionally, it is proved that the volume of built-in air gap has positive effects on both sound absorption and insulation properties. The results from Finite Element Method (FEM) numerical simulations correlated well with experimental data, proving the efficiency of the simulation and validating the experimental results.

AB Shells, a type of food waste, present a notable challenge in achieving high-value applications in the environmental sector owing to their complex compositions, limited recycling applications, and the environmental impact of improper disposal. This study conducts a comparative analysis of the mechanical properties of five types of natural shells: veined red snail, mussel, oyster, scallop, and green willow clam. Shell powders and polylactic acid (PLA) were used as the inorganic and organic components of shells, respectively. The laser sintering mechanism for forming these components was explored, resulting in the fabrication of five biomimetic shells. Results showed that the flexural strength decreased in the order of veined red snail > mussel > scallop > green willow clam > oyster. The flexural strength values of laser-sintered specimens made from five shell powder/PLA composites corresponded closely to those of their respective shells, with values of 8.6, 8.1, 7.6, 6.9, and 6.1 MPa.

AB Commercial available filaments made from poly(lactic) acid (PLA) are selected for potential use in 3D printed parts by fused deposition modeling. Virgin materials (PLA Eum, Z-PLA Pro), but also recycled matrices (PLA 2Life, PLA Eubio), and one filled with wood fibers (PLA Woodfir) have been considered. Then, a lab-made filament (PLA Nature) is realized by extruding PLA pellets. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and rheological measurements are used to determine initial degradation temperature, glass transition, melting temperature, and complex viscosity as a function of time and material pre-drying. A preliminary investigation of thermal properties enables the materials' processing window to be validated in order to prevent the deterioration during the process. PLA Nature and PLA Woodfir melt around 170 degrees C, whereas all of the other biopolymers show a lower melting point (around 150 degrees C). The temperature at which thermal degradation began is always greater than 260 degrees C. However, good stability of rheological parameters over time at 210 degrees C is not confirmed for all bio-filaments. In particular, for Z-PLA Pro and PLA Eubio, a significant reduction of complex viscosity is verified after a few seconds of testing. Drying samples have been shown to improve the long-term stability of complex viscosity.

AB Replacing river sand entirely with recycled glass (RG) aggregate in concrete is an intriguing approach to multiplying the sustainable impact of three-dimensional concrete printing (3DCP). This research aims to evaluate the prospects for utilizing solely RG as aggregate in concrete for 3DCP considering various factors, including rheological properties, shape stability, phase separation, and alkali-silica reaction (ASR). RG was prepared to obtain an approximate grading of river sand, which served as reference material. Varying quantities of fly ash were incorporated into the binder containing 8% silica fume to determine the appropriate concrete proportion that not only provided suitable properties for 3DCP but also hindered the ASR of RG. Actual 3D printing was conducted to examine the printability of concrete. The result indicated that when fly ash was not added, replacing river sand entirely with RG aggregate resulted in significant reductions in the rheological properties and thixotropy index of concrete while displaying negligible impact on shape stability, bleeding, and printability. Nevertheless, the addition of fly ash caused a decrease in rheological properties and thixotropy index, as well as an increase in the deformation and bleeding on both types of concrete, affecting the printability of the mixtures. The variation in the thixotropy index indicated that RG concrete appeared to be inappropriate for 3D printing since the incorporation of fly ash exceeded 30%. This observation agreed well with the findings related to shape stability and bleeding of concrete, where concrete using RG aggregate with more than 30% fly ash exhibited significant deformation and bleeding. Although the ASR of RG aggregate seemed substantially severe in mortar bars without fly ash, it was well hindered in RG concrete incorporating fly ash, making concrete using RG innocuous according to a recent standard. These findings present a promising prospect for the entire replacement of river sand by RG in concrete for 3DCP.

AB The sustainable utilization of polymers depends on efficient recycling and the ability to retain their critical physical properties for further processing. In this study, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) nanocomposite properties were enhanced by the integration of carbon dots (CDs), in terms of processability and optical traceability during recycling. HDPE composites with varying CDs loadings were prepared to assess their effects on optical and mechanical properties over three consecutive recycling cycles. The composite containing 0.5 wt% CDs demonstrated a 17% increase in tensile strength after recycling, with a maximum strain of 11%, significantly outperforming the neat HDPE while preserving its crystalline structure. Additionally, incorporating 0.1 wt% CDs reduced the wear rate by up to 98%, highlighting a substantial improvement in durability. Improved process- ability of the recycled material was confirmed by producing 3D-printed specimens at each CDs concentration. Notably, composites containing 0.1 wt% CDs exhibited excellent printability even after three recycling cycles. CDs have also been utilized as luminescence tracers. This study revealed that the quenching of the blue phosphorescence associated to the carbonyl groups of the polymer backbone was highly dependent on the CDs content. Importantly, nanocomposites with 0.1 wt% CDs exhibited progressive luminescence changes corresponding to the number of recycling cycles, enabling quick and reliable traceability and sorting using standard mobile phone cameras. These findings are highly promising, paving the way for rapid, automated, and scalable HDPE recycling. This innovation offers significant potential for advancing the circular economy of HDPE and enhancing the sustainability of polymer materials.

AB Vat photopolymerization (VP) additive manufacturing (AM) is valued for its speed, precision, and material versatility. However, its requirement for support structures limits printable geometries, complicates post-processing, and generates non-recyclable waste when typical thermoset resins are used. Here, a wavelength-selective resin system for VP that enables single-vat, multi-material printing with dissolvable supports is introduced. Exposure to visible light produces a rigid, dissolvable thermoplastic, while UV light forms a crosslinked thermoset resistant to dissolution. This process, termed selective solubility vat photopolymerization (SSVP), eliminates the geometric constraints imposed by conventional VP methods, facilitating the creation of complex objects with supports that are removable using green and food-safe solvents such as D-limonene and ethyl acetate, as well as mineral oil. Post-print heat treatment tunes crosslink density and solubility. Dissolved supports can be recycled into fresh resin and reprinted without mechanical property loss, offering a practical, scalable route to reducing waste. Additionally, SSVP provides spatial control of dissolution kinetics, enabling programmable 3D dissolution profiles. By enabling the integration of dissolvable and insoluble regions in a single print, SSVP sets the stage for fully automated and more sustainable AM workflows.

AB Polymer 3D printing has motivated researchers toward the use of this technology for the maintenance and repair of heritage structures. This results in the exploration of different thermoplastic composites as smart materials having properties like programmable features (one-way, two-way), sensing, etc. Also, the excessive use of thermoplastics in various fields has resulted in plastic solid waste management issues. Several studies have been reported on plastic solid waste management with 3D printing. But hitherto little has been reported on the use of heritage site debris as reinforcement in the thermoplastic matrix for addressing issues of plastic solid waste management as well as for inducing controlled 4D capabilities; for better maintenance and repair of the heritage site with shorter maintenance and repair time. The present study is focused on secondary (2) recycling of polyvinylidene fluoride thermoplastic material by reinforcing limestone (CaCO3 of 220 mesh size as per American Foundry Society (AFS)) collected as debris from heritage site for 3D printing applications followed by an analysis of its possible 4D capabilities. Different compositions/proportions of polyvinylidene fluoride-limestone were explored for acceptable rheological (melt flow index and viscosity), thermal (based on differential scanning calorimetry), mechanical (based on universal testing machine), and spectroscopic properties (based on attenuated total reflection-Fourier transformed infrared and photoluminescence). Piezoelectric property analysis of 3D printable composition/proportion and shape-memory effect of each composition/proportion was performed to investigate the 4D characteristics of the proposed composite. The results of the study suggest that polyvinylidene fluoride-6% limestone is a better composition/ proportion with acceptable rheological, thermal, and mechanical properties (melt flow index 2.429 g/10 min, viscosity 12742.9 Pa-s, thermal heat capacity 31.66 Jg(-1), and Young's modulus 286.56 MPa) for selected heritage structures. For 4D capabilities, piezoelectric coefficient (D-33 21.79 pC/N) and shape recovery (44.31%) have been ascertained for the best composition/ proportion selected. Further morphological analysis has been reported to support the test results.

AB This study investigates the effects of partial substitution of Ordinary Portland Cement with different proportions of non-calcined marine clay and different grades (by particle size) of Ground Limestone to formulate 3D-printable concrete. Non-calcined clay was used because of its lower energy requirement than calcined clay. The rheology of the mixes was evaluated by extrudability, tack, Large Amplitude Oscillatory shear, and Logarithmic Stress Ramp tests. Their mechanical performance was evaluated with respect to compressive, splitting, shear, and three-point bending (flexural) strengths. Results show that adding only about 1 % of oven-dried (low temperature) marine clay and 19 % of limestone improve cohesion and build-up of static yield strength while ensuring extrudability. This study hopes to pave the way for more studies on using non-calcined marine clay as a more sustainable option for construction 3D printing.

AB Closed-loop manufacturing reintegrates components and/or materials from the end-of-life products as input flows to produce new products. Today, most learning factories focus on the actual manufacturing system. Some learning factories extend the perspective and include the product development and product use phase. To enlarge the learning perspective towards end-of-life an existing learning factory is extended by a modular, self-designed recycling process chain enabling closed-loop manufacturing. The modular process chain consists of crushing end-of-life products and extruding new filament out of the shredded material. The filament is then utilized to create new products with 3D-printers substituting virgin material. The developed recycling process chain is implemented in an existing learning environment which is equipped with 3D-printers. Further didactic courses are designed considering the ageing of the material and the environmental impact along the product's life cycle. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB ISO 52,900 material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing utilises materials to manufacture customisable components. End of life parts lead to accumulation of nondegradable plastic wastes with detrimental environmental impacts. Circular methods to close the loop will reduce the wastes that would end up in landfill. Recycling polylactic acid (PLA) has been reported to negatively impact the mechanical properties com-pared to the virgin material. We investigate the addition of copper microparticles, found in old electronic parts, to recycled PLA and its effects on the mechanical properties. We pelletise the extruded filament and use it as the feedstock for another further extrusion to simulate the recycling process. The first extrusion showed a good copper dispersion in the PLA matrix, the novelty of the second pass was to create a model to evaluate mechanical performance. Commercially available 60wt% copper filament was used as a benchmark. Tensile strength and modulus of extruded filament were found to be 48.8 MPa and 2.3 GPa for sample with quarter copper loading, respectively. All extruded filaments outperformed commercial filament in fracture toughness, with values of 1.06 MPapm for quarter copper loading and 1.1 Mpapm for half copper loading, with re-extrusion reducing fracture toughness by 34% and 9%, respectively.

AB The construction industry is a key sector behind the climate change. Not only does it produce enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, but also absorbs tons of natural aggregates irreversibly. Therefore, this study proposes an alternative approach to the climate change problem by producing a cement-glass composite brick (CGCB) with a printed internal scaffold from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PET-G). This novel construction material, which consists of about 75% of waste glass and 10% of recycled PET-G scaffolding, has a great potential for tackling this problem. The filling mixture itself- cement-glass mortar (CGM) - and ready-made bricks with an internal PET-G scaffolding (3Dhon structure) were tested to verify the accuracy of the assumptions. The scope of this study included mechanical and thermal tests to indicate the properties of the newly manufactured material. The analysis of the results showed that the final CGCB with 3D printed PET-G scaffolding has better thermal properties than CGM as thermal diffusivity (8%) and decreased specific heat (10%). Additionally, significantly reduced flexural strength and compressive strength has been observed (about 30% of both factors) with almost 100% larger strain during compression testing.

AB In this work, self-made laboratory centrifuge equipment was developed for the separation of suspensions and immiscible liquids. This centrifuge was based on the Arduino microcontroller and fabricated from simple and recycled mechanical and electronic parts, spending an inexpensive budget suitably. The centrifuge frame and rotors were manufactured of Polylactic Acid (PLA) filaments, which were printed in a 3D printer. Two rotors labeled R50 and R15 were designed and fabricated to use tubes of 50 mL and 15 mL, respectively. The maximum speed reached, without vibration interferences, was 3350 and 3030 rpm for R50 and R15 rotors, respectively. The total fabrication cost of the fabricated centrifuge was less than 100 USD and the assembly process was not complicated. Finally, the centrifuge performance was evaluated through phases of separation of precipitate of CuCO3(s) and clinical blood samples. The obtained results showed achievement in components separation, entirely comparable with those obtained employing a commercial centrifuge.

AB Soft, flexible electronics is boosting the monitoring physiological data and assessing health conditions. However, their further practical utilization is limited due to the lack of intrinsic adhesion interfaces for mechanical deformation, self-healing capability against mechanical damages, and degradable properties for the waste electronic products treatment. Herein, we report the design concepts, materials, fabrication methods, and multifunctional applications of a new type of self-healing and degradable flexible health-detection electronics based on three-dimensional (3D) printable polymers and liquid metals. The 3D printed elastomer processes amazing self-healing efficiency (99.5 %), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength: 3104 kPa), degradable, intrinsic adhesion, etc. Polymer elastomers combined with the fluidity of Galinstan (GaInSn) allow the electronic devices to heal from fracture and restore electrical performance. Our polymer elastomers effectively solve the coordination problems between solid-state electronic devices and substrates, greatly improving the integration and functional complexity of the functional devices. The reliable connection between the GaInSn circuit, commercial components and elastomers can easily measure various physiological signals such as electrophysiology, temperature, and body motions. In addition, the commercial components and GaInSn circuits can be well recycled through ethanol to reduce pollution to the environment. The present 3D printed self-healing multi-functional electronics enables new opportunities for promising applications of flexible electronic devices.

These molds are often handmade from wood; however, additively manufacturing (AM, or 3D printing) fiber-reinforced polymer composites is an advantageous alternative, producing significantly more durable, highly complex molds faster, but likely at a higher cost. This study explores the impact of material and production variables on the cost, energy, and carbon emissions of employing composite AM molds over the full lifecycle. The case study employed techno-economic and life cycle assessments to show that using wood flour-poly(lactic acid) or recycled carbon fiber-acrylonitrile butadiene styrene for AM molds can be less expensive than conventional wood molds, especially when considering use phase costs. While wood molds have the least environmental impacts due to wood's higher biogenic carbon sequestration and minimal processing, optimizing AM designs could reduce energy demand, carbon emissions, and cost.

AB Traditional assembly line manufacturing is speculative, costly and environmentally unsustainable. It is speculative because it commits substantial resources energy, materials, shipping, handling, stocking and displaying without a guaranteed sale. It is costly because each of these resources material, process, people and place involves expense not encountered when a product is manufactured at the time of sale. It is environmentally unsustainable because, no matter how much recycling is done, not using the resources unless actually needed is always a better path.
   As part of the RAGNAROK (Research on Advancing Glass & Nonorganic Applications to Recreate Objects & Kinetics) project in HP Labs, we identified glass as a promising candidate for additive manufacturing based on 3-D printing methods. Glass is a silica-based material. With 90% of the earth's crust composed of silicate minerals, there will be no shortage of silica resources. Glass is easy to recycle and is environmentally friendly. Glass is inexpensive but looks precious, is pleasant to the touch and is so familiar that customers will not be disappointed by its fragility
   under certain conditions. A major need, and concomitantly a major challenge, for 3D printed glass is transparency. We will discuss several methods how to achieve it.

AB In this work, we investigated the photocatalytic removal of NOx using 3D-printed supports. Monolithic supports with internal channels were fabricated by Fused Modelling Deposition (FDM) using PET as the filament feedstock. The printing parameters of the supports were optimized to maximize the exposure of the photocatalyst to UV light throughout the monolithic PET printed supports. The removal experiments were carried out in a continuous gas phase flow reactor, which was custom designed in-house incorporating a 3D printed PET support impregnated with TiO2 as photocatalyst. The impregnated and non-impregnated supports were characterized by diffuse reflectance spectrometry, SEM and AFM. The effect of several key-factors on the NOx removal capacity was investigated, including the type of PET filament (native recycled, BPET vs. glycol-modified, PETG), the type of TiO2 (P25 vs. Hombikat UV-100), the UV light source (LED vs. tubular lamps), and the number of deposited TiO2 layers. The highest NO and NOx removal were achieved by using PETG supports coated with a single layer of Hombikat UV-100 and irradiating the flat reactor from both sides using two sets of black light lamps. However, the highest selectivity toward nitrate formation was obtained when using P25 under the same experimental conditions. This work demonstrates that 3D printing is a reliable and powerful technique for fabricating photocatalytic reactive supports that can serve as a versatile platform for evaluating photocatalytic performance.

AB A precision dimple grinder-polisher has been designed and constructed using 3D printing. The purpose of the device is to produce a thin central area in 3 mm round samples for transmission electron microscopy before ion milling to electron transparency. The device can be self-made by any laboratory with a 3D printer for scientific research or teaching, and when combined with recycling and use of biodegradable filaments it can help labs reach their sustainable development goals. A novel sample holder design allows sample alignment without a monocular and thickness detection by light transmission. Novel solutions are developed for aligning the grinding disc and sample rotation motors and for fixing the polishing cloth to the polishing disc. The diameter-depth relationship is investigated for steel and plastic grinding discs. Design principles and materials are discussed, and the tool is evaluated by preparing samples from copper, silicon and tungsten, which are then examined in the transmission electron microscope to evaluate their quality.

AB Polycarbonate (PC) is a widely used thermoplastic. Therefore, the amount of waste produced is notable. The exploitation of such waste is of great interest nowadays in the industry and academic society, due to its contribution to environmental pollution and other negative consequences. Herein, the possibility of using PC scrap as a raw material in 3D printing (material extrusion - MEX) is reported. The efficacy of the PC polymer after six thermomechanical courses was evaluated. The effect on rheology, mechanical performance, and thermal behavior is reported. The morphological characteristics were also assessed through scanning electron microscopy, while two quality metrics, i.e., geometrical accuracy and 3D printing structure porosity of the parts, were investigated through micro-computed tomography. The findings were correlated to report the impact of thermomechanical processing on the PC polymer properties. A 9% tensile strength increase compared to the virgin polymer is reported (third round), while the flexural strength was improved by 14% (second round). Then the strength declined. It was lower than that of the virgin material on the sixth thermomechanical repetition. The findings showed that the life of PC can be extended through thermomechanical recycling for 3D printing applications.

AB Substantial progress in battery and control technology has drastically enabled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to evolve and develop for utilization across a broader array of applications. Remote sensing imagery in UAVs are evidently exhibiting its remarkable reliability, efficiency and integrability. Furthermore, technological advancements in additive manufacturing enable rapid prototyping of designs in a more cost-effective manner. This paper describes the design, construction and testing of a UAV with a foldable airframe, manufactured from recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) plastic, through 3D printing filament for the purpose of remote sensing. Previous contributions demonstrated the ability of manufacturing UAVs from recycled plastic and the feasibility of utilizing PET. This paper further develops the design, functionality and application of the UAV through additional material testing, design optimization and added design features. The new UAV design features include; propeller protection to enable remote sensing in isolated and inaccessible areas, integrated printed circuit board (PCB) to power onboard systems and reduce cable clutter, and material testing and analysis for usability of PET in multiple extreme weather environments. Moreover, the optimized UAV design will allow ease of integration with onboard systems, as well as cater for multiple interchangeable rotor arm designs, including protected and unprotected propeller designs. The objective of the research and investigation is focused on the development and implementation of cost-effective and environmentally sustainable UAVs. This paper strives to enable UAV manufacturers to rapidly prototype and optimize UAV designs, while simultaneously deterring PET plastic pollution globally, with negligible effect on UAV functionality.

AB Fibre-reinforced polymer structures are often used when stiff lightweight materials are required, such as in aircraft, vehicles and biomedical implants. Despite their very high stiffness and strength(1), such lightweight materials require energy- and labour-intensive fabrication processes(2), exhibit typically brittle fracture and are difficult to shape and recycle(3,4). This is in stark contrast to lightweight biological materials such as bone, silk and wood, which form by directed self-assembly into complex, hierarchically structured shapes with outstanding mechanical properties(5-11), and are circularly integrated into the environment. Here we demonstrate a three-dimensional (3D) printing approach to generate recyclable lightweight structures with hierarchical architectures, complex geometries and unprecedented stiffness and toughness. Their features arise from the self-assembly of liquid-crystal polymer molecules into highly oriented domains during extrusion of the molten feedstock material. By orienting the molecular domains with the print path, we are able to reinforce the polymer structure according to the expected mechanical stresses, leading to stiffness, strength and toughness that outperform state-of-the-art 3D-printed polymers by an order of magnitude and are comparable with the highest-performance lightweight composites(1,12). The ability to combine the top-down shaping freedom of 3D printing with bottom-up molecular control over polymer orientation opens up the possibility to freely design and realize structures without the typical restrictions of current manufacturing processes.

ID MECHANICAL PROPERTY; 3D; CARBON; ABS
AB Environmentally friendly materials are emerging materials that find applications in an increasing number of cases when being three-dimensional printed (3D-P), as they can provide many possibilities and offer unique properties to fulfill industrial needs and requirements. As part of that effort, recycled (from sheet trimmings waste) poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and (nature-sourced) biochar were selected to be combined and examined herein. Composites with Biochar concentration in the 0.0-10.0 wt % (step 2.0 wt %) range were assessed. Compounds were extruded into filaments, which fabricated coupons (material extrusion 3D-P) for the tests that followed. The samples were experimentally evaluated for their characteristics related to mechanical, chemical, rheological, and thermal behavior, as well as for their structure and morphology. Mechanical testing included tensile, bending, and Charpy Notched coupons' investigation. The microhardness was also measured. In addition, quality characteristics were assessed through porosity and dimensional deviation data analysis. The composite distinguished in relation to pure PMMA was PMMA/Biochar 6.0 wt % (>20% increase in the strength on the tensile and flexural experiment), as most of the investigated properties revealed their greatest values in that Biochar concentration. Furthermore, the eco-friendly biochar addition positively affected most of the recycled PMMA characterization metrics assessed, showing potential for the environmentally friendly composites developed herein for the 3D-P process.

AB Mechanically recyclable thermoplastic polymers are used in preparation of lightweight, high-efficiency aerogel filter media for air filtration with the aid of fused filament fabrication three-dimensional (3D)-printing technique. The all-polyolefin composite filter media is composed of isotactic polypropylene (iPP) gyroid frameworks and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) aerogel infill. The solid content of HDPE needed to obtain a free-standing gel from its solutions is first determined. The aerogel morphology is investigated using scanning electron microscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller nitrogen adsorption analysis. The HDPE aerogel is constructed of lamellar crystalline platelets. The compression tests show that the use of 3D-printed iPP frames in the composite filter media provides adequate compressive modulus (similar to 100 MPa). The nanometer size pores and the tortuous air flow path are responsible for high filtration efficiency (>99.97%) for the all-polyolefin composite filter media, higher than the standard for high-efficiency particulate absorption filters, typically 99.95%. The study is extended to repurpose 3D-printed filaments obtained from the blends of iPP and HDPE with up to 30 wt % HDPE into fabrication of mechanically strong supporting frames that can host HDPE aerogel. The excellent printability and low warpage values demonstrate the feasibility of repurposing waste polyolefin materials into value-added filter media products.

AB Recycling always acts as the best solution for the aggravated plastic pollution. One of the potential applications for these recycled plastics is 3D printing filaments in the Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) Printers. However, the mechanical performance of recycled plastics may not up to standard for application, thus additives arc essential to improve their mechanical properties. Talc powder has been used in the polymer industry for many years owing to its abundance, non-toxicity, high aspect ratio and low-cost. Besides traditional additive, the alternative to talc powder is the bio-oil extracted from food waste using in the recycled 3D printing filaments is also being investigated under our research study. The objective of this paper is studying the effectiveness of talc on mechanical properties alteration in different types of polymers, and the production method and ratio of talc content for talc-filled composites in previous works of literature. It is found that the twin-screw extrusion process is commonly adopted for many studies. It is confirmed that talc can improve stiffness, crystallization, thermal stability and modify the viscosity behavior of different polymers, but high talc content would reduce the impact strength and strain at break.

AB Global plastics pollution has a triad impact on the environment, energy, and climate. Numerous innovative closed-and open-loop plastics recycling or upcycling methods have been created or suggested, addressing a range of concerns related to the realization of a circular economy. In the pursuit of sustainable polymeric materials, this study explores the use of depolymerized polyethylene terephthalate (PET), derived from waste, as a dynamic crosslinker to enhance the properties of functionalized post-consumer recycled polypropylene (PCR PP). Following glycolysis, waste PET was converted to BHET (bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate) with very high yield, which was subsequently employed to introduce dynamic covalent bonding in maleated PCR PP through transesterification reactions with the maleic anhydride groups following industrially viable melt extrusion approach. The resulting crosslinked PCR PP, exhibits vitrimer-like properties, allowing for reprocess ability, high dimensional stability and enhanced mechanical strength (14% improvement in yield strength as compared to PCR PP) and rheological performance. Characterization of the crosslinked polymer network confirmed the formation of reversible ester linkages, contributing to improved material durability and recyclability without any significant phase separation. This approach not only adds value to PET waste by converting it into a functional additive but also enhances the properties of polyolefins, offering a sustainable and circular solution for advanced polymer applications with controlled flow characteristics. Finally, a 3D printed product is successfully fabricated from this vitrimer using Fused Granulate Fabrication (FGF), an extrusion-based 3D printing process, which is not feasible with unmodified PCR PP due to its high MFI (melt flow index) resulting from chain-scission during processing. This study demonstrates the potential of using depolymerized polymers as dynamic crosslinkers to create highperformance, reprocessable materials, promoting both environmental and economic benefits.

AB 3D printing is the technology of choice for the rapid production of objects with complex morphologies and controlled physical and chemical properties. 3D printing by photopolymerization is of great interest because of its ability to access very small scales and its high resolution. In the case of recent 3D printers, the preferred wavelength for light irradiation is 405 nm since it is a safe and energy-economical irradiation. For 3D printing to be effective, it is therefore necessary to develop easily accessible, stable and highly efficient photoinitiating systems at the 405 nm wavelength. Beside, with the increasing use of photoinitiators, it is essential to develop structures with low cytotoxicity. Hence, the development of new photoinitiators is currently of major interest. To this end, the photochemical properties (triplet energy, bond dissociation energy, cleavage reaction enthalpy, and absorption properties) of several molecules have been calculated by molecular modeling and the most promising compounds have been synthesized. In this paper, four phosphine oxides photoinitiators (ADPO-1, CPO-2, CPO-3, and FPO-1) are synthesized and characterized. Subsequently, their absorption properties are measured and their efficiencies in photopolymerization under LED irradiation at 405 nm are evaluated. It is important to note that these structures have never been reported in 3D printing. Markedly, among the obtained photoinitiators, two of them show better efficiency than the commercially available and widely used phenylbis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (BAPO) in photopolymerization (i.e., (Rp/[M-0]) x100 values are 6.94, 12.95, and 4.93 s(-1) for CPO-2, ADPO-1, and BAPO; with [M-0] the initial acrylate function concentration). Furthermore, one of the synthesized photoinitiators is successfully used in 3D printing of thermoplastics for potential recycling ability. Finally, one of the obtained structures shows a lower cytotoxicity than the benchmark structure diphenyl(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)phosphine oxide (TPO).

AB In the past two decades' significant studies have been reported on electrically conducting thermoplastic composites of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), etc. for the fabrication of novel energy storage devices (ESD) by 3D printing. But hitherto little has been reported on online condition monitoring of ESD prepared by secondary (2 degrees) recycling of ABS. This study reports the investigations on mechanical and electrical properties of NH4Cl-ZnCl2 (electrolyte) reinforced ABS composite (as 3D printed sensor) for online condition monitoring of ESD. In a typical dry cell, the electrolyte is one of the integral parts, and the change in its dielectric properties with the time/ applied electric load has been used to ascertain the health of ESD (online) as the internet of things (IoT) based solution (Bluetooth application) in industry sports and medicine (ISM) band (2.4 GHz). Based on melt flow index (MFI), 10% NH4Cl and 10% ZnCl2 (by weight%) were reinforced in ABS for preparing 3D printed rectangular substrates as ring resonators for calculating dielectric constant (epsilon(r)) and loss tangent/dissipation factor (tan delta) for the resonant frequency. Transmission line parameters (S-21) were observed using a vector network analyzer (VNA), and a high-frequency structure simulation (HFSS) software package. The results are supported by morphological analysis of ABS composite based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), 3D rendering, surface roughness (R-a), area mapping, current (I)-voltage (V), and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) characterization.

AB Additive manufacturing (AM, aka 3D printing) is generally acknowledged as a "green" technology. However, its wider uptake in industry largely relies on the development of composite feedstock for imparting superior mechanical properties and bespoke functionality. Composite materials are especially needed in polymer AM, given the otherwise poor performance of most polymer parts in load-bearing applications. As a drawback, the shift from mono-material to composite feedstock may worsen the environmental footprint of polymer AM. This perspective aims to discuss this chasm between the advantage of embedding advanced functionality, and the disadvantage of causing harm to the environment. Fused filament fabrication (FFF, aka fused deposition modelling, FDM) is analysed here as a case study on account of its unparalleled popularity. FFF, which belongs to the material extrusion (MEX) family, is presently the most widespread polymer AM technique for industrial, educational, and recreational applications. On the one hand, the FFF of composite materials has already transitioned "from lab to fab" and finally to community, with far-reaching implications for its sustainability. On the other hand, feedstock materials for FFF are thermoplastic-based, and hence highly amenable to recycling. The literature shows that recycled thermoplastic materials such as poly(lactic acid) (PLA), acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET, or its glycol-modified form PETG) can be used for printing by FFF, and FFF printed objects can be recycled when they are at the end of life. Reinforcements/fillers can also be obtained from recycled materials, which may help valorise waste materials and by-products from a wide range of industries (for example, paper, food, furniture) and from agriculture. Increasing attention is being paid to the recovery of carbon fibres (for example, from aviation), and to the reuse of glass fibre-reinforced polymers (for example, from end-of-life wind turbines). Although technical challenges and economical constraints remain, the adoption of recycling strategies appears to be essential for limiting the environmental impact of composite feedstock in FFF by reducing the depletion of natural resources, cutting down the volume of waste materials, and mitigating the dependency on petrochemicals.

AB To facilitate automation in manufacturing porous concrete and also decrease the cement content of relevant 3D printed concrete, a new type of sandwich-structured porous concrete was proposed in this work by using mortar-extrusion and aggregate-bed 3D printing. Three mixes of mortar made of cement, sand, water, superplasticizer, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and sodium gluconate with different water-to-cement ratios were evaluated, and one of which was selected to manufacture the sandwich-structured porous concrete by printing the mortar first and then spreading single-sized coarse aggregates on top of the mortar. The printing process went well with the designed mixes and procedures. The porosity and permeability of the printed porous concrete were tested based on the water permeation methods and X-ray computed tomography. And the compressive strength and splitting tensile strength of the specimens were also tested. Results showed the mortar with a water-to-cement ratio of 0.325 was more appropriate for the present printing. And larger aggregate increased the mortar infill in the pores and thus reduced the porosity of the printed porous concrete, which resulted in higher mechanical strengths and lower permeability. On the contrary, smaller aggregates were prone to overlap each other, which facilitated the printing procedures but reduced the strength of the concrete. Generally, the aggregates with size of 1 similar to 1.5 times of the designed mortar-layer thickness showed better performances on the property tests for the printed porous concrete. Moreover, better buildability resulted in shallower aggregate-embedding depth, and finally increased the permeability but decreased the compressive strengths of the concrete. Larger porosity mainly appeared in smaller-aggregate specimens which reduced the possibility of loading on the aggregate layer during the parallel splitting tensile strength test, and thus increased the measured value. However, larger porosity generally led to smaller compressive and perpendicular splitting tensile strengths but larger permeability. This study may help to increase the manufacturing efficiency and environmental friendliness of porous concrete in future practice.

AB The construction industry is increasingly exploring lightweight materials to reduce structural load and improve sustainability. Expanded polystyrene (EPS) foams have gained attention for their lightweight properties, while their application in 3D-printed concrete remains underexplored. The evaluation of how EPS affects the mechanical performance of 3D-printed concrete is essential since it could lead to innovative lower-density materials that balance weight reduction with structural integrity. This study investigates the mechanical behavior of 3Dprinted concrete incorporating EPS foams, focusing on optimizing EPS content for performance. Specimens with EPS substitution ratios of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 % were prepared for both cast and 3D-printed formats, with densities ranging from 2138 to 2080 kg/m3. Mechanical testing revealed that EPS-printed samples exhibited significant improvements in flexural strength, increasing from 0.1 MPa to 2.48 MPa, while experiencing a reduction in compressive strength by 8.58 %-36.52 %. A 20 % EPS substitution ratio provided a favorable balance, maintaining comparable compressive strength to mold-cast specimens and achieving minimal anisotropy (0.038). Microstructural analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computed tomography (CT) were conducted to assess the internal microstructure and foam distribution. This highlighted the refined cellular structures and localized cement infiltration as key contributors to the observed mechanical properties. In addition, environmental impact indicators such as acidification potential (AP) and global warming potential (GWP) demonstrated a 6-8 % reduction in comprehensive environmental impact at 20 wt% EPS foam incorporation. These findings demonstrate that incorporating EPS foams into 3D-printed concrete yields lowerdensity, mechanically sound materials, which could promote sustainable construction and enhance efficiency and versatility in modern building practices.

AB The technology supporting 3D Printing Concrete (3DPC) has developed rapidly in recent years. However, inadequate understanding of nozzle-related parameters and a lack of standards for fresh and hardened property testing methods are key challenges to addressing, or rethinking, how to improve printability. To explore how nozzle design and relevant parameters impact upon printability and delineate nozzle operability criteria, this paper conducts a systematic content review of 70 research papers on nozzle design that were published over the past decade (2012 to 2022), focusing on notable gaps in prevailing literature in terms of: current design practices of a nozzle; correlations between nozzle and printability; and current advances in testing methods. Emergent findings suggest that four nozzle-design parameters have the highest potential impacts on printability, viz.: nozzle travel speed; nozzle size; nozzle shape; and distance of the nozzle to the build. Subsequently, the research proposes operability criteria for these four parameters to assist researchers and practitioners set appropriate nozzle-related parameters during printing. Finally, sustainability challenges (such as reduced printing produc-tivity, the blocking problem and limited utilization of waste recycling) in nozzle-adopting are further elucidated upon and recommendations for future work are given. Overall, the findings presented provide both theoretical and practical contributions for nozzle development and open a new horizon in optimization for 3DPC performance.

AB Three-dimensional (3D) printed calcium phosphate cement (CPC) scaffolds are increasingly being used for bone tissue repair. Traditional materials used for CPC scaffolds, such as bovine and porcine bone, generally contain low amounts of calcium phosphate compounds, resulting in reduced production rates of CPC scaffolds. On the other hand, cockle shells contain more than 99% CaCO3 in the form of amorphous aragonite with excellent biocompatibility, which is expected to increase the CPC production rate. In this study, 3D-printed cockle shell powder-based CPC (CSP-CPC) scaffolds were developed by the material extrusion method. Lactic acid and hyaluronic acid were used to promote the printability. The characterization of CSP-CPC scaffolds was performed using Fourier transform infrared spectra, X-ray diffraction patterns, and scanning electron microscopy. The biocompatibility of CSP-CPC scaffolds was evaluated using cell viability, Live/Dead, and alkaline phosphatase assays. In addition, CSP-CPC scaffolds were implanted into the mouse calvarial defect model to confirm bone regeneration. This study provides an opportunity to create high value added in fishing villages by recycling natural products from marine waste.

AB Successful recycling of electronic waste requires accurate separation of materials such as plastics, PCBs and electronic components on PCBs (capacitors, transistors, etc.). This article therefore proposes a vision approach based on a combination of 3D and HSI data, relying on the mutual support of the datasets to compensate existing weaknesses when using single 3D- and HSI-Sensors. The combined dataset serves as a basis for the extraction of geometric and spectral features. The classification is performed and evaluated based on these extracted features which are exploited through rules. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using real electronic waste and leads to convincing results with an overall accuracy (OA) of 98.24%. To illustrate that the addition of 3D data has added value, a comparison is also performed with an SVM classification based only on hyperspectral data.

AB Elastomers and rubber are common industrial materials used for test objects, supporting parts, and many other commercial products. The industrial processing of these materials is currently dominated by injection molding, which reduces manufacturing costs and speeds up production. However, this manufacturing method does not permit personalization or customization and lacks the versatility of other techniques such as three-dimensional printing. Understandably, there has been a move toward additive manufacturing (AM) with elastomers. This work proposes a new approach to AM with liquid latex, using a drop-on-demand (DoD) based inkjet to fabricate latex patterns. The printhead actuator benefits from a higher material compatibility compared to conventional inkjet/extrusion-based printers, allowing the jetting of viscous fluids, as well as liquids with high solid loading. The setup allows printing with viscous liquid latex of a high solid content (60 wt. %). The process is controllable and reliable, making the printing of patterns possible. In addition, we explore printing with micronized rubber powder (MRP) made from end-of-life tires, to test solid-particle loading compatibility and as a novel method for rubber recycling. In this study, we demonstrate that large-scale DoD inkjet printing is capable of handling solid particle loadings of up to 10wt. % in addition to the high solid content liquid latex. Moreover, multilayer objects were created from pure liquid latex, as well as from MRP/latex suspensions. Material characterization indicates that the stiffness of cured latex is not altered by the addition of MRP, but reduces the maximum elongation length from 750% to 430%. The results highlight the ability to print with both high particle loading and large particles. This explorative study demonstrates the potential of AM processes with liquid latex, as well as a new approach to tire rubber reuse.

ID ACCURATE
AB Recycling of printed circuit boards (PCBs) is one of the open challenges in research. For recycling, the identification of the components on PCBs is of great importance. For PCB component classification the height profile of a PCB is one of the important features. One approach to obtain this profile is photogrammetry employing different views of the PCB's surface. Thereby, rectification of the images is essential for highly accurate, dense 3D reconstruction employing block matchers. However, commonly utilized rectification approaches rely on the fundamental matrix which deteriorates in scenes with low depth structure. Thus, a new rectification approach is needed for the case of PCBs. We propose a homography-based approach employing salient image features which are tracked in the images of a camera moved fronto-parallel above the PCB. It can be shown that the accuracy of the 3D reconstruction after applying the proposed rectification allows reconstructing structures at 0.1 mm accuracy. This is sufficient for detecting small surface mounted devices with a minimal height of 0.2 mm.

AB Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) technology in 3D printing offers numerous advantages, such as costeffectiveness, ease of use, and the ability to produce complex geometries with minimal material waste; however, surface quality remains a significant challenge. This study investigates how the hardness and melt flow properties of the raw material affect surface roughness and how this can be improved by post-machining. Modified recycled poly(ethylene terephthalate) (RPET) was used as the raw material in the experiments, considering aspects of the circular economy. The material properties were adjusted by varying the ratio of ethylene-butyl-acrylate-glycidyl-methacrylate (EBA-GMA) additive. It was demonstrated that a decrease in the melt flow rate (MFR) results in more uniform deposited layers, leading to smoother surfaces. By systematically varying turning parameters and applying statistical analysis, it was shown that feed rate has the most significant impact on surface roughness. Using a feed rate of 0.1 mm/rev reduced the average surface roughness from 13-25 mu m to 2-4 mu m. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that the surface characteristics after post-processing were minimally influenced by material hardness. This suggests that the findings are likely applicable to 3D printing with other plastics as well.

AB Numerous studies have been reported in the past on the fabrication of short-range gun silencers by 3D printing of virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS)-based composite matrix. But hitherto little has been reported on enhancing the performance of such silencers (in terms of enhanced mechanical and thermal properties) for a long service life of the functional parts. Also, limited work has been reported on the use of secondary recycled ABS composite in such applications. Melamine formaldehyde (MF) is one of the thermosetting having acceptable flame-retardant capabilities (available as waste from kitchenware product manufacturing). In this study, the MF was reinforced in an ABS matrix based on acceptable rheological properties followed by a twin screw extrusion process for the fabrication of feedstock filament for the fused filament fabrication (FFF) in line with the concept of circular economy. The functional prototypes of secondary recycled ABS-MF composite (87.5-12.5% by wt.) were prepared with FFF, and the mechanical properties (tensile, compression, and flexural) were optimized. The study reveals that infill density (ID) is the most significant factor for the best mechanical properties of functional prototypes as ultimate tensile strength of 31.68 MPa, ultimate compressive strength of 52.09 MPa, and ultimate flexural strength of 91.85 MPa (supported by optical photomicrographs based on scanning electron microscopy analysis). For multi-factor optimization of FFF (for ABS-MF composite) in silencer application, zig-zag infill pattern (IP) with 100% ID, 0.15 mm layer height, 0.9 mm top and bottom layer thicknesses, and wall line count of 2, at a print speed of 50 mm/s was observed as the best combination.

AB Polycarbonate (PC) is emerging as one of the fastest-growing engineering plastics, but its potential for its application in a circular economy requires further investigation. This research explores the technical feasibility, carbon footprint, and economic impact of recycling injection moulding PC waste via fused deposition modelling (FDM) at a biotechnology manufacturer plant in the UK. The results show that recycling moulded PC scrap using FDM yields 3D printed parts with 88-98 % of virgin PC mechanical properties, produces nearly 70 % less carbon footprint, and saves up to 88 % of costs than utilizing virgin PC material.

AB In this paper, we present the results of a preliminary experimental campaign conducted on a 3D-printed wall 40 cm thick made of three concrete walls, connected by metal pins and concrete curbs to form three types of cavity - one rectangular and two triangular. The tests were performed in a climatic chamber at the Pietro Pisa Laboratory of the University of Brescia. The wall thermal performance has been evaluated by examining four scenarios in which the cavities have been filled with insulating material made of cellulose-based recycled flakes characterized by a declared thermal conductivity of 0.038 W/mK. The wall thermal transmittance U is measured based on the temperatures and heat fluxes measured through the structure. Based on the degree of filling, the wall thermal transmittance ranges between 1.58 W/m(2)K for the wall without insulation, and 0.28 W/m(2)K for the configuration with all cavities completely filled.

AB This study investigates the printability and mechanical properties of 3D printed recycled sand concrete (3DPRSC) based on different silica fume (SF) contents (5 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %), PVA fiber (PVAF) contents (0.5 %, 1 %, 1.5 %), and basalt fiber (BF) contents (0.1 %, 0.3 %, 0.5 %). Further, based on the uniaxial compression test, the uniaxial compression constitutive model for 3DPRSC is proposed, considering the effects of varying SF, PVAF, and BF contents. Finally, the microstructure mechanism is explained through microscopic tests. The results show that adding 1.0 % PVAF and 0.3 % BF significantly enhances compressive and splitting tensile strength of 3DPRSC. With the increase of SF, the characteristic values of 3DPRSC generally increase first and then decrease. The addition of PVAF enhances the peak stress, peak strain, and ultimate strain of 3DPRSC, while BF has a lesser impact on these characteristic values. The fitting results of the proposed uniaxial compression constitutive model align well with the stress-strain curves. After adding fibers, fluctuations in the ascending branch were reduced, and the descending branch became smoother. Microscopic experiments indicate that an appropriate amount of SF can enhance the compressive and splitting tensile strength of 3DPRSC. A suitable content of fiber can form a directional distribution of networks inside 3DPRSC, enhancing its mechanical properties, but excessive fiber content will cause fiber agglomeration and lead to more harmful pores inside 3DPRSC while amplifying mechanical anisotropy. These research results can provide an important theoretical basis for the design of 3DPRSC.

AB The development of additive manufacturing (AM) technology has unlocked new geometric and material potentials for architecture and construction. While large-scale implementation of AM continues to be a popular research topic, the majority of projects are restricted to traditional planar layer-based printing methods. Furthermore, many modern large-scale 3D printing machines rely on heavy cementitious material, which further limits the benefits which can be gained from additive processes. These traditional printing methods restrict construction to mainly vertical walls with roof structures and overhangs posing major challenges. Robotic fabrication and materials research present opportunities for effective and efficient applications of AM in architecture. The following research takes place over several phases and explores fabrication strategies which combine AM and fiber composites to produce lightweight building components. (1) The first phase tests the material capabilities of a reinforced AM system, including the production and testing of several hybrid material systems. An emphasis is placed on sustainable alternatives to traditional concretes and polymers. (2) The second phase develops, tests, and refines hybrid material fabrication processes, which include printing on complex formwork and composite substrates. (3) Phase three includes material investigations, manufacturing processes, and geometric iterations to determine the compatibility of various recycled thermoplastics and textile/film membranes. Custom and adaptable robotic AM techniques take advantage of 9 axis fabrication to 3D print material efficient, non-planar, and geometrically differentiated components. (4) The final phase further explores and develops the geometric potential of the developed fabrication processes and material systems. Numerous building components are 3D printed and tested for structural capabilities. These components are assembled into a full-scale demonstrator which explores various architectural potentials of the system including cantilevering structures, roof systems, multi-material assemblies, joint logics, enclosure systems, and scalar limitations. This project showcases the potential for lightweight composite reinforced additive manufacturing processes for large-scale architectural applications.

A thorough investigation was carried out to determine the effect of the continuous recycling on mechanical, structural, and thermal responses of HDPE polymer via a process that isolates the thermomechanical treatment from other parameters such as aging, contamination, etc. Fused filament fabrication (FFF) specimens were produced from virgin and recycled materials and were experimentally tested and evaluated in tension, flexion, impact, and micro-hardness. A thorough thermal and morphological analysis was also performed. The overall results of this study show that the mechanical properties of the recycled HDPE polymer were generally improved over the recycling repetitions for a certain number of recycling steps, making the HDPE recycling a viable option for circular use. Repetitions two to five had the optimum overall mechanical behavior, indicating a significant positive impact of the HDPE polymer recycling aside from the environmental one.

AB Stereolithography (SL) can fabricate complex ceramic parts layer by layer using computer-aided design (CAD) models. The traditional SL system utilizes a vat filled with ceramic slurry with a high solid content, which for ceramics contributes to several limitations and operational difficulties, and further renders it nonrecyclable mainly due to the presence of printed residue and its high viscosity. In this study, we utilized a continuous film supply (CFS) system integrated with a tape-casting type digital light processing (DLP) printer to fabricate zirconia prototypes with a solid content of 45 volume percent (vol.%). Various printing and postprocessing parameters were studied for optimization, to achieve a relative density of 99.02% +/- 0.08% with a microhardness of 12.59 +/- 0.47 GPa. Slurry reusability was also demonstrated by printing with recycled slurry to produce consistent relative density values in the range of 98.86% +/- 0.02% to 98.94% +/- 0.03%. This method provides new opportunities for material recycling and the fabrication of dense complex ceramic products, reducing the consumption of the material.

In addition to introducing the concept and fundamentals of the ASMT, the potential applications of the ASMT either alone or integrated with an existing mature technique (such as, 3D printing, quick response (QR) code, lenticular lens) and phenomena (e.g., wrinkling and stress-enhanced swelling effect) in product design, manufacturing, and recycling are demonstrated. It is concluded that the ASMT is indeed able to provide a range of powerful approaches to reshape part of the life cycle or the whole life cycle of products.

AB This paper highlights the machinability of primary recycled thermoplastics as workpiece (WP) material with secondary recycled (reinforced) thermoplastic composites as rapid tooling (RT). Both WP and RT have been 3D printed on commercial fused deposition modelling. For investigating machinability of primary recycled thermoplastics, un-reinforced WP of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) has been selected. The RT materials were secondary reinforced (recycled) LDPE with double particle size Al2O3 particles and HDPE with triple particle size Al2O3. The machinability has been calculated in terms of weight loss of WP, while machining on a vertical milling set-up. This study also reports the surface hardness, porosity, surface roughness (Ra) and photomicrographic observations of WP and RT under controlled machining conditions. Further thermal analysis suggests that primary recycled thermoplastic can be successfully machined with secondary recycled RT, resulting in improved thermal stability and surface properties.

AB Selective laser sintering (SLS) is the most common used 3D printing method for polymer materials. This technology uses a CO2 laser to melt polyamide powder. While previous studies have focused on parameters including laser power, layer height, scan speed, hatch spacing and bed temperature. This research fills a gap in the literature by investigating a currently untested parameter for the SLS process: print surface bed temperature. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between print bed temperature, layer height, and laser power as they pertain to surface roughness and dimensional accuracy. A range of values for parameters were explored in order to assess their combined effect on polyamide 12 3D printed part's quality. Surface roughness was evaluated using Ra, Rq, Rz and RSM by means of a roughness tester. While dimensional precision was analyzed by measuring the deviation from CAD design using two methods involving 3D scanner and caliper. The results indicate that print surface bed temperature (+ 5 = 182.5 degrees C) increases part powder sintering, decreasing part quality and recycling. Besides, large laser powers and moderate print surface temperatures result in poor dimensional precision and positive error in 3D parts. Furthermore, medium print surface temperature and thinner layer height results on greater dimensional accuracy. Conversely, low print surface temperature and laser power produce 3D parts with negative dimensional accuracy. For surface roughness, lowering the print surface bed temperature offset (-5 = 172.5 degrees C) lowers Ra and Rq. In contrast, maximizing laser power ratio to 3 and printing surface bed temperature offset to 0 reduces the surface quality. As well as, a lower layer height, laser power ratio, and print surface bed temperature offset reduce surface disruptions and enhance surface quality. These findings offer new insights into optimizing SLS processes and set the groundwork for further investigations on print surface bed temperature.

AB The rapid increase in the application of carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites in the fabrication and development of modern industrial products is attributed to their light-weight nature, excellent mechanical properties, and corrosion resistance, among other factors. Additive manufacturing of recycled carbon fiber (rCF), which has garnered significant attention in recent years owing to the massive potential waste obtained from carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPC) and the manufacturing of rCF after the surface treatment produced the parts with excellent properties comparable to virgin carbon fiber (vCF). Additive manufacturing of rCF obtained after recycling has received much interest over the past few years because of the massive potential waste of the carbon fiber and the excellent properties after the surface treatment of the rCF. This research examines additive manufacturing of the rCF, surface treatment for enhancing the properties of the printed specimens, the potential waste of the carbon fiber obtained from the different sectors, and applications of reclaimed carbon fiber composites in manufacturing various products. Specifically, the mechanical characteristics of the printed specimens using rCF and the different percentages of the rCF reinforcement in the other polymer's matrix composites are discussed. This work demonstrates that an additive manufacturing-based recycling approach can recycle carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (rCFRPC) waste and create high-performance engineering parts with complicated geometries that are both cost-effective and environmentally acceptable. This review also defines the significant challenges and outlook for future developments in manufacturing of rCFRPC.(c) 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB The circular economy is gaining growing attention as a way for reducing demands on finite raw materials and minimizing negative externalities. To attain these goals, new trends on circular economy have been explored based on systemic approaches, which require the involvement and commitment of different actors, from citizens to policy makers. Plastics have been identified as a priority for circular economy implementation, since the principles of this economy can significantly contribute to optimize material flows and reduce negative externalities, such as plastic leakage into oceans. This paper describes an educational project that empowers children to reduce waste in schools and strengthens the role of end-users in building a more sustainable world. The ReShape IT project was designed as a way of encouraging students' participation as the key drivers in the value and supply chain of an eco-innovative solution for the development of 3D printed educational tools, such as world maps, geometric figures, supports for school materials, boards, prototypes for specific internal projects, among others, from recycled plastics. Students are encouraged to easily separate specific domestic waste (HDPE, PET), simply by looking at their recycling codes (1 or 2). This waste is the recycled and integrated into educational tools. Additionally, students will be granted with 'points' convertible into discounts in the acquisition of educational materials for the schools. It is also a project's ambition to improve the interaction between citizens and the different actors in this "closed-loop", being envisaged a strong commitment of municipalities and local communities to promote a more efficient use of resources, increasing the awareness on the impact of circular economy in sustainability. The project considers the implementation of new processes to recover/recycle plastics from wastes, modifying the existing collecting and sorting systems (directly implemented at schools through a recycling rewards scheme). In this sense, it will improve waste collection approaches by encouraging behavioural changes and increase public awareness and social involvement to promote recycling and enable a greater involvement of end-users, i.e. students, their families, and education professionals and municipalities. Moreover, the students are engaged in the entire recycling process, from the implementation of the collecting schemes, the materials processing, to the design of the educational tools. As such, the recyclability assessment of recovered plastic waste and optimization of converting processes parameters (by 3D printing of plastic filament) will be performed to design and manufacture innovative educational tools and devices according to the specific needs of the end-users (students and schools) and educational requirements. This project is therefore aligned with Europe 2020 strategy for the Sustainable Growth, by stimulating and engaging the society, in particular children and educational professionals, to promote a more efficient use of the resources, and mobilizing the industrial symbiosis by transforming the plastic waste collected into valuable raw materials for the generation of educational tools and devices, ultimately fostering the creation of a more sustainably-minded society.

AB Thermoplastic polyolefins (TPOs) crosslinked by dynamic covalent bonds (xTPOs) have the potential to be the most utilized class of polymer in the world, with applications ranging from household and automotive to biomedical devices and additive manufacturing. xTPO combines the benefits of thermoplastics and thermosets in a "single material" and potentially avoids their shortcomings. Here, we describe a new two-stage reaction extrusion strategy of TPOs with a backbone consisting of inert C-C bonds (polypropylene, PP), and thiol-anhydride, to dynamically crosslink PP through thiol-thioester bond exchange. The degree of PP crosslinking determines the rubber plateau modulus above the melting point of the plastic: the modulus at 200 degrees C increases from zero in the melt to 23 kPa at 6% crosslinking, to 60 kPa at 20%, to 105 kPa at 40%. The overall mechanical strength of the solid xTPO plastic is 25% higher compared to the original PP, and the gel fraction of xTPO reaches 55%. Finally, we demonstrate that the crosslinked xTPO material is readily reprocessable (recycled, remolded, rewelded, and 3D printed).

AB This paper presents recycling of selective laser sintering (SLS) waste nylon into printable filaments and parts reinforced with Mg particles. Waste nylon and waste-Mg powder mixture with 2%, 4%, and 8% Mg to nylon were extruded into the filaments. Moisture absorption, differential scanning calorimetry, and melt flow index experiments were conducted to determine the thermal characteristics, while tensile and flexural tests were conducted to evaluate mechanical properties and failure mechanisms. The results were compared with off-the-self (OTS) nylon. Waste powder was found to be extrudable and printable as FFF filament. Waste filament diameter closely matched standard filament size, while exhibiting reduced moisture absorption. High melting and crystallisation temperature for the waste nylon demonstrated a degradation of the plastic during the SLS process. Young's modulus and ultimate tensile strength for the waste filament increased by 1.6-fold compared to that for OTS, while Mg-composite filament surpassed the waste and OTS. Waste and Mg composite dog bone results showed an increase in strength and stiffness, but the ductility deteriorated. Both flexural strength and modulus for the waste nylon increased by 13% and 26%, respectively, over OTS, and the addition of Mg enhanced flexural strength by up to 5-fold at 8% Mg over the waste. Printed surface topography demonstrated that the waste and Mg composite filaments can print the parts with desired geometric shapes and acceptable surface texture. The findings showed that recycling waste SLS powder into FFF prints would be a viable and useful alternative to disposal, given its abundance.

AB The three-dimensional (3D)-printing of hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties has attracted extensive attention owing to their potential applications in many fields. Through the photoinitiated copolymerization of methacrylic acid (MAAc) and N-(pyridin-2-yl)acrylamide (NPAM) in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), a copolymer solution was prepared; it was then 3D printed at 70 degrees C followed by solvent replacement of DMSO with water at 25 degrees C, and a novel 3D-printed tough hydrogel was prepared. In the presence of water, NPAM could undergo "multi-fold" hydrogen bonding with MAAc. Thus, the hydrogen bonding is strengthened and stabilized by the hydrophobic alpha-methyl of MAAc and the pyridine N-heterocycle of NPAM, meaning that the modules of the hydrogel can be up to five times stronger than the original organogels. The swelling or shrinkage of the gel is negligible during solvent replacement and the resultant hydrogel exhibits excellent mechanical properties, with an elastic modulus of 1.8-66 MPa, a tensile fracture stress of 2.2-6.3 MPa, a fracture strain of 360-570% and a fracture energy of 0.5-7.2 kJ m(-2). In addition, owing to the dynamic nature and temperature sensitivity of the hydrogen bonds, the hydrogel also exhibited fast self-recovery abilities and temperature activated shape memory properties. In particular, the hydrogen-bonding hydrogel could be quickly degraded and recovered by adjusting the pH, which allowed convenient recycling of the hydrogels. Our experimental results indicated that the combination of a 3D-printing technique and solvent replacement may provide a novel and effective method to obtain 3D-printed hydrogels with high mechanical strength and shape recovery properties, fostering their use in a number of fields such as soft robots, implant devices, tissue engineering and other environment friendly materials.

AB The "Digital Transition" of the building sector and in particular the concrete 3D printing is profoundly changing building technologies and construction processes. However, the materials engineering is still a challenge for the research of even more effective and performing 3D printable concrete. In this context, we analysed magnesium potassium phosphate cement (MKPC) performance as an innovative cementitious material in terms of sustainability and possibility of its use in extrusion-based 3D concrete printing (3DPC). Starting from common formulations present in literature, we discussed the relationship between water to binder ratio and workability in two different quantities of retarders. Some mix compositions were also prepared by replacing sand with rubber aggregates or glass aggregates with the aim of creating lightweight aggregate-based mortars. In addition, the fly ash (FA), a widely material used (but that will not be available in the next few years), was replaced with silica fume (SF). We found that two formulations (samples 2 and 7) show rheological requirements and compressive strengths at 90 min of respectively about 2 MPa and 3 MPa, which are deemed to be suitable for 3D printing processes. Moreover, in sample 7, the use of the expanded recycled glass as aggregate opens new possibilities for reducing the carbon footprint of the process.

TI A renewably sourced, circular photopolymer resin for additive
   manufacturing
SO NATURE
LA English
DT Article
ID POLYMERS; NETWORKS
AB The additive manufacturing of photopolymer resins by means of vat photopolymerization enables the rapid fabrication of bespoke 3D-printed parts. Advances in methodology have continually improved resolution and manufacturing speed, yet both the process design and resin technology have remained largely consistent since its inception in the 1980s(1). Liquid resin formulations, which are composed of reactive monomers and/or oligomers containing (meth)acrylates and epoxides, rapidly photopolymerize to create crosslinked polymer networks on exposure to a light stimulus in the presence of a photoinitiator(2). These resin components are mostly obtained from petroleum feedstocks, although recent progress has been made through the derivatization of renewable biomass(3-6) and the introduction of hydrolytically degradable bonds(7-9). However, the resulting materials are still akin to conventional crosslinked rubbers and thermosets, thus limiting the recyclability of printed parts. At present, no existing photopolymer resin can be depolymerized and directly re-used in a circular, closed-loop pathway. Here we describe a photopolymer resin platform derived entirely from renewable lipoates that can be 3D-printed into high-resolution parts, efficiently deconstructed and subsequently reprinted in a circular manner. Previous inefficiencies with methods using internal dynamic covalent bonds(10-17) to recycle and reprint 3D-printed photopolymers are resolved by exchanging conventional (meth)acrylates for dynamic cyclic disulfide species in lipoates. The lipoate resin platform is highly modular, whereby the composition and network architecture can be tuned to access printed materials with varied thermal and mechanical properties that are comparable to several commercial acrylic resins.

AB Purpose Despite the dramatic increase in construction toward additive manufacturing, several challenges are faced using natural materials such as Earth and salt compared to the most market-useable materials in 3D printing as concrete which consumes high carbon emission. Design/methodology/approach Characterization and mechanical tests were conducted on 19 samples for three natural binders in dry and wet tests to mimic the additive manufacturing process in order to reach an efficient extrudable and printable mixture that fits the 3D printer. Findings Upon testing compressive strength against grain size, compaction, cohesion, shape, heat and water content, X-Salt was shown to record high compressive strength of 9.5 MPa. This is equivalent to old Karshif and fire bricks and surpasses both rammed Earth and new Karshif. Material flow analysis for X-Salt assessing energy usage showed that only 10% recycled waste was produced by the end of the life cycle compared to salt. Research limitations/implications Findings are expected to upscale the use of 3D salt printing in on-site and off-site architectural applications. Practical implications Findings contribute to attempts to resolve challenges related to vernacular architecture using 3D salt printing with sufficient stability. Social implications Benefits include recyclability and minimum environmental impact. Social aspects related to technology integration remain however for further research. Originality/value This paper expands the use of Karshif, a salt-based traditional building material in Egypt's desert by using X-Salt, a salt-base and natural adhesive, and investigating its printability by testing its mechanical properties to reach a cleaner and low-cost sustainable 3D printed mixture.

AB The increase in non-face-to-face lifestyles due to COVID-19 worldwide have shown an increase in delivery services. The number of parcels in 2020 was 3.373 billion, an increase of 20.9% from 2.788 billion in 2019. This phenomenon increased delivery box waste. Against this background, this study attempted to develop building materials from the recycling of delivery boxes. In this study, the self-developed WC (wet cellulose) 3D printer confirmed the standardization and uniform performance of the sample by filling the material supply cylinder with cellulose filaments and spraying the composite material through a 10 mm nozzle. The cellulose filament for a WC 3D printer is based on cellulose extracted from wastepaper, and a cellulose filament composite material is used by mixing additives. After manufacturing a specimen using the WC 3D printer, a reliability test for the flame-retardant performance of the material was conducted according to the ISO 11925-2 test method. As a result of the experiment, flame-retardant performance was confirmed at a 40 wt% or greater ceramic binder content. In addition, the WC 3D printer achieved accurate test results by producing specimens with uniform physical properties. In addition, we confirmed that 3D-printed WC can be used to develop customized building materials that can prevent fire spread.

AB In this work different ways to valorise discarded ear tags made of TPU from livestock sector were studied. This singular residue does not require separation from other plastics like other industrial and urbane wastes, which could contribute to simplify its management. Firstly, mechanical processing was carried out by several cycles of consecutive extrusion and injection processes. The material obtained in each process was characterized using different physical, chemical and mechanical characterization techniques in order to study the degradation as a consequence of processing cycles. Thereafter, suitable filaments for 3D printing were obtained and the effect of infill pattern in the mechanical properties of the printed pieces was investigated. Besides, an electrospun mat constituted by TPU waste microfibers was successfully obtained by electrospinning, and its morphology together with superficial and mechanical properties were characterized. Results showed that these applications were suitable options to valorise TPU waste consisting of discarded ear tags. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

ID PHOTOPOLYMERIZATION
AB Advances in vat photopolymerization (VP) 3D printing (3DP) technology enable the production of highly precise 3D objects. However, it is a major challenge to create dynamic functionalities and to manipulate the physical properties of the inherently insoluble and infusible cross-linked material generated from VP-3DP without reproduction. The fabrication of light- and high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)-responsive cross-linked polymeric materials linked with hexaarylbiimidazole (HABI) in polymer chains based on VP-3DP is reported here. Although the photochemistry of HABI produces triphenylimidazolyl radicals (TPIRs) during the process of VP-3DP, the orthogonality of the photochemistry of HABI and photopolymerization enables the introduction of reversible cross-links derived from HABIs in the resulting 3D-printed objects. While photostimulation cleaves a covalent bond between two imidazoles in HABI to generate TPIRs only near the surface of the 3D-printed objects, HIFU triggers cleavage in the interior of materials. In addition, HIFU travels beyond an obstacle to induce a response of HABI-embedded cross-linked polymers, which cannot be attainable with photostimulation. The present system would be beneficial for tuning the physical properties and recycling of various polymeric materials, but it will also open the door for pinpoint modification, healing, and reshaping of materials when coupled to various dynamic covalent materials.

AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the applications of 3D printing in space sectors. The authors have highlighted the potential research gap that can be explored in the current field of study. Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic or polymers to build simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight and excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. Therefore, efforts have been made to make the adoption of 3D printing successful in space so that complex parts can be manufactured in space. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for additive manufacturing is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero-gravity missions, subjected to onboard international space station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges like space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components as well as a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by additive manufacturing. Moreover, these components can be recycled onboard to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature, i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature, and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value This review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. This paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. This paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that additive manufacturing faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic makes protective visors important for protecting people in close contacts. However, the production of visors cannot be increased greatly in a short time, especially at the beginning of the pandemic. The 3D printing community contributed largely in fabricating the visor frames using the rapid and adaptive manufacturing ability. While there are many open source designs of face visors for affordable 3D printers, all these designs fabricate mono-sized frames without considering diverse users' dimensions. Here, a new method of visor post-processing technology enabled by closed loop controlled 4D printing is proposed. The new process can further deform the printed visor to any customized size for a more comfortable user experience. FEM analysis of the customized visor also shows consistent wearing experience in different circumstances compared with the old visor design. The fabrication precision and time cost of the method is studied experimentally. A case study regarding the reducing, reusing and recycling (3R) of customized visors in classrooms is proposed to enable the customized visors manufactured in a more sustainable way.

AB Sustainable materials, such as recyclable polymers, become increasingly important as they are often environmentally friendlier than their one-time-use counterparts. In parallel, the trend toward more customized products demands for fast prototyping methods which allow processing materials into 3D objects that are often only used for a limited amount of time yet, that must be mechanically sufficiently robust to bear significant loads. Soft materials that satisfy the two rather contradictory needs remain to be shown. Here, the authors introduce a material that simultaneously fulfills both requirements, a 3D printable, recyclable double network granular hydrogel (rDNGH). This hydrogel is composed of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid) microparticles that are covalently crosslinked through a disulfide-based percolating network. The possibility to independently degrade the percolating network, with no harm to the primary network contained within the microgels, renders the recovery of the microgels efficient. As a result, the recycled material pertains a stiffness and toughness that are similar to those of the pristine material. Importantly, this process can be extended to the fabrication of recyclable hard plastics made of, for example, dried rDNGHs. The authors envision this approach to serve as foundation for a paradigm shift in the design of new sustainable soft materials and plastics.

AB Advances in the development of new composite materials and conductive filaments play a crucial role in making electrochemical devices low-cost and sustainable. In this regard, we introduce a streamlined, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable approach to creating an effective composite material from recycling ABS waste. This method holds promise for future production of a conductive filament by integrating graphite into the ABS polymer matrix. This approach, combined with 3D printing technology, enables the creation of ready-to-use electrochemical sensors without the need for electrochemical surface treatment. The proposed devices were duly characterized using spectroscopic, imaging, and electrochemical techniques. Thus, a square wave voltammetry (SWV) method was optimized for the determination of the herbicide Diuron (DIU) using recycled sensors. The method presented two linear working ranges from 0.25 to 2.5 and from 5.0 to 20.0 mu mol/L with a detection limit on the nanomolar scale (68.9 nmol/L) and a relative standard deviation of less than 3.1 %. The proposed method was applied to the analysis of sugar-cane juice and cacha & ccedil;a. The recovery values obtained for the spiked samples ranged from 99.8 to 110.8 %. These results make it feasible to apply the sensor for determining DIU in beverage samples. Furthermore, the recycled sensor proved to be free of interference from the matrix and other commonly used pesticides. Therefore, the applicability of the proposed sensor for sensitive and selective monitoring of DIU in beverage samples is highlighted.

AB Wind energy is one of the most widely produced sources of renewable and clean electricity. However, the blades of wind turbines pose a significant environmental challenge due to the difficulty in recycling them. To address this issue, research is focused on finding a recyclable and easily manufacturable thermoplastic material. This study compares four thermoplastic materials fabricated using 3D printing: polylactic acid (PLA), PLA with carbon fiber reinforcements (PLA + C.F.), polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), and PETG with carbon fiber reinforcements (PETG + C.F.). The material with the best properties will be used in the manufacturing of vertical wind turbine blades. Samples underwent tests for tensile strength, flexural strength, impact resistance, hardness, thermal aging, and UV exposure. The results demonstrated that PETG + C.F. is the most suitable material to produce wind turbine blades, as it exhibits excellent tensile and flexural strength, elasticity, thermal resistance, and improved hardness when exposed to ultraviolet radiation. It was found that PETG + C.F. made at 250 degrees C has the best properties for the fabrication of wind turbine blades. The incorporation of carbon fibers within the PETG matrix significantly improves the tensile strength.

AB As one of the ways contributing to the progress of the industrialization of the construction industry, 3D printed concrete (3DPC) has attracted more and more attention in recent years. The utilization of 3DPC can accelerate the construction speed, save the labor and raw materials, as well as improve the design freedom of construction without formworks. However, one of the most significant challenges for the application of 3DPC is the printing materials. These is a significant difference in the mixtures and performance between 3DPC and normal concrete. In order to provide an intensive reference for future studies to satisfy the performance requirements of 3DPC structures, this study firstly reviews the performance requirements of 3DPC, including the printability, fresh and hardened mechanical properties, and durability. Based on this, the specialized test methods for 3DPC are reviewed for the effective quality evaluation of 3DPC. The last part presents a review of mix design from the point of view of different materials and mix design approaches. The results show that 3DPC needs to meet the printability that it has higher requirements for rheology, hydration, and green strength than normal concrete. The interlayer bond is the key to study the anisotropic strength and durability degradation. More accurate test methods and testing standards should be developed. Besides, coarse aggregates and recycled materials need to be considered in the mix design of 3DPC. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

   printing; Recyclable soft materials; Medical applications
AB Integrated printing of magnetic soft robots with complex structures using recyclable materials to achieve sustainability of the soft robots remains a persistent challenge. Here, we propose a kind of ferromagnetic fibers that can be used to print soft robots with complex structures. These ferromagnetic fibers are recyclable and can make soft robots sustainable. The ferromagnetic fibers based on thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU)/NdFeB hybrid particles are extruded by an extruder. We use a desktop three-dimensional (3D) printer to demonstrate the feasibility of printing two-dimensional (2D) and complex 3D soft robots. These printed soft robots can be recycled and reprinted into new robots once their tasks are completed. Moreover, these robots show almost no difference in actuation capability compared to prior versions and have new functions. Successful applications include lifting, grasping, and moving objects, and these functions can be operated untethered wirelessly. In addition, the locomotion of the magnetic soft robot in a human stomach model shows the prospect of medical applications. Overall, these fully recyclable ferromagnetic fibers pave the way for printing and reprinting sustainable soft robots while also effectively reducing e-waste and robotics waste materials, which is important for resource conservation and environmental protection.

AB Food processing byproducts are potential filling materials for fabricating sustainable composites with broad applications. We herein report the use of spent coffee grounds (SCG) and spent tea leaves (STL) to prepare biomass/poly(lactic acid) (PLA) composites as novel 3D-printing inks. The results show that the 3D-printability can be upheld at a high biomass loading of 40 wt %. As for strength performance, the biomass addition disrupted the PLA structure and reduced the tensile strength of the 3D-printed specimens. However, elongation at break was enhanced 5-fold at 20 wt % SCG, which could be attributed to the plasticizing effect of the naturally occurring oil in SCG. The SCG oil can be added to STL/ PLA for improved ductility. With little oil (<30 mg/g composite) at similar to 20 wt % biomass loading, samples prepared from 155 degrees C-filament showed higher tensile strength than those at 185 degrees C. Microscopic imaging evidenced more significant pore formation in the latter, rendering the structure delicate. These findings reveal the complex effects of filler properties on the biomass-PLA interface that determines the composite performance.

AB Polymers and their composites are now widely used in several industrial sectors, owing to their flexibility in developing customized products. The significant surge in plastic usage has led to a severe challenge in managing end-of-life plastic waste. Millions of tons of plastic waste produced annually mainly end up in landfills, leaking into the environment and posing severe threats to ecosystems. Innovative solutions to reuse/recycle/repurpose plastic waste are desired to address these global challenges. Therefore, in this study, a sustainable route to converting plastic waste into additive manufacturing (AM) feedstock is presented, where waste plastic bottles (mainly Polyethylene Terephthalate, PET) are recycled using an in-house 3D-printed filament extrusion system to produce filaments for fused filament fabrication (FFF) process. In addition to the recycled PET (rPET), virgin carbon fiber reinforced polyamide-6 (PA6-CF) polymer composites were also used to produce hybrid feedstock filaments. The rPET and rPET/PA6-CF composite filaments were extruded using an in-house filament extruder setup. The produced rPET-based filaments were characterized for their chemical and thermal properties. Subsequently, mechanical characterization was performed on 3D-printed specimens. The mechanical analysis revealed better tensile strength for rPET/PA6-CF than rPET; however, the rPET demonstrated better failure strain and young modulus, demonstrating their potential as viable materials for industrial and consumer applications. The outcomes of this study revealed promising results to promote sustainable production and consumption, complementing the circular economy practices with a straightforward production route to convert plastic waste into AM feedstock.

AB The integration of fibers offers a means to fabricate intricate, load-bearing architectural configurations that were previously challenging to achieve with conventional 3D printed concrete. This study investigates the incorporation of recycled plastic fibers (RPFs) derived from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene (PP) to enhance the mechanical properties of 3D printed cementitious composites (3DPCC). Two distinct fiber lengths, 6 mm and 12 mm, were utilized for each fiber type across various fiber volume fractions ranging from 0.3 % to 1.5 % of the mortar volume. The results show that the optimal volume fractions are 1 % for 6 mm fibers and 0.7 % for 12 mm fibers. The findings indicate that hybrid combinations of PP and PET fibers achieve superior mechanical characteristics compared to the use of individual fiber types. The assessment of fresh mortar properties included fluidity, buildability, and extrudability, along with the evaluation of compressive and flexural strength as indicators of mechanical properties. Additionally, this study assessed the influence of a hybrid fiber mix comprising 40 % PP and 60 % PET of the 6 mm fiber length volume fraction, which exhibited the highest average compressive (20.6 %) and flexural strength (44.9 %) in the Z direction for 3DPCC, surpassing the performance of individual PP and PET fibers at the same volume fraction across all the volume ratios. When 12 mm fibers were utilized, the compressive and flexural strengths in the Z direction increased by 20.8 % and 46.7 %, respectively, for a mix of 20 % PP and 80 % PET of the total volume fraction. Concerning buildability, the control sample achieved a maximum of 29 layers, whereas the addition of 1.5 % PET fibers at 12 mm enabled the structure to reach 48 layers.

AB Protein digestion is one of the most important processes in proteomic analysis. Here, we report microwave assisted protein digestion in a plate well, which allows for facile sampling as well as rapid protein digestion based on the combination of highly stable enzyme immobilization and 3D printing technologies. Trypsin (TR) was immobilized on polystyrene-based nanofibers via an enzyme coating (EC) approach. The EC with stabilized TR activity was assembled with the 3D-printed structure in the plate well (EC/3D), which provides two separated compartments for the solution sampling and the TR-catalyzed protein digestion, respectively. EC/3D can effectively prevent the interference of sampling by accommodating EC in the separated compartment from the sampling hole in the middle. EC/3D in the plate well maintained its protein digestion performance under shaking over 160 days. Microwave irradiation enabled the digestion of bovine serum albumin within 10 min, generating the MALDI-TOF MS results of 75.0% sequence coverage and 61 identified peptides. EC/3D maintained its protein digestion performance under microwave irradiation after 30 times of recycled uses. EC/3D in the plate well has demonstrated its potential as a robust and facile tool for the development of an automated protein digestion platform. The combination of stable immobilized enzymes, and 3D-printed structures can be potentially utilized not only for the protein digestion, but also for many other enzyme applications, including bioconversion and biosensors.

AB Ultraviolet(UV) printing of photopolymers is a widely adoptedmanufacturing method because of its high resolution and throughput.However, available printable photopolymers are typically thermosets,resulting in challenges in postprocessing and recycling of printedstructures. Here, we present a new process called interfacial photopolymerization(IPP) which enables photopolymerization printing of linear chain polymers.In IPP, a polymer film is formed at the interface between two immiscibleliquids, one containing a chain-growth monomer and the other containinga photoinitiator. We demonstrate the integration of IPP in a proof-of-conceptprojection system for printing of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) films andrudimentary multi-layer shapes . IPP shows in-plane and out-of-planeresolutions comparable to conventional photoprinting methods. CohesivePAN films with number-average molecular weights greater than 15 kgmol(-1) are obtained, and to our knowledge this isthe first report of photopolymerization printing of PAN. A macrokineticsmodel of IPP is developed to elucidate the transport and reactionrates involved and evaluate how reaction parameters affect film thicknessand print speed. Last, demonstration of IPP in a multilayer schemesuggests its suitabiliy for three-dimensional printing of linear-chainpolymers.

AB The laboratory waste produced in several parts of the world has scaled up the pollution and adverse effect on human health in the present era. The "3 R" (reduce, reuse, and recycle) scheme is adopted by many communities for efficiently recovering waste products and utilizing them for the production of energy. In the present work, the laboratory waste is collected and directly utilized for fabricating a laboratory waste-based triboelectric nanogenerator (LW-TENG) operating in vertical contact-separation mode. The substrate, electrode, and triboelectric layer are randomly selected from lab waste. The waste plastic petri dishes were extruded into thin filament wires for 3D printing of the substrate for the LW-TENG. The effective electrical output is generated by LW-TENG having a triboelectric layer plastic-glass delivering voltage of 185 V, current of 1.25 mu A, and power density of 8.1 mu W/ cm2 across the load resistance of 500 M omega. The positive and negative triboelectric layers are altered and the electrical output is systematically investigated. Additionally, the LW-TENG device is attached to various locations of the laboratory to demonstrate the energy harvesting from the mechanical motions. It is also utilized for demonstrating real-time applications that could be beneficial as a self-powered human tracking device (HSD) that tracks the location of the human during an emergency and self-powered exercise counter.

AB Rechargeable aqueous ammonium-ion batteries (AIBs) hold great potential for sustainable energy storage due to their low cost, high safety, and outstanding electrochemical characteristics. However, their development is hindered by the limited availability of suitable anode materials. Herein, we propose for the first time the use of a topological insulator, bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), as a novel anode material integrated onto a 3D printed nanocarbon electrode (3DpCE) for NH4+ ion storage. Taking advantage of the 3D porous framework and the non-metallic nature of NH4+ ions, Bi2Te3@3DpCE exhibits a higher discharge capacity of 128 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1) with lower polarization, and better cycling stability compared to metallic ions such as Li+ and Na+. Through various ex-situ characterizations, we also reveal the plausible NH4+ storage mechanism. A full cell based on a "rocking-chair" configuration is constructed using copper hexacyanoferrate (CuHCF) as the cathode. The CuHCF@3DpCE//Bi2Te3@3DpCE full cell in 1 M (NH4)(2)SO4 electrolyte delivers a high energy density of 134.8 Wh kg(-1) and a power density of 1800 W kg(-1), outperforming previously reported AIBs. Furthermore, the recyclability of the used 3D printed nanocarbon electrode is demonstrated, highlighting its eco-friendly potential. These findings offer a promising pathway toward high-performance, sustainable, next-generation AIB technologies.

ID CONFIGURATION; FUTURE; PHYSICS
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to compile the successful implementation of three-dimensional (3D) printing in the space for the manufacturing of complex parts. 3D printing is an additive manufacturing (AM) technique that uses metallic powder, ceramic, or polymers to build simple/complex parts. The parts produced possess good strength, low weight, excellent mechanical properties and are cost-effective. This saves a considerable amount of both time and carrying cost. Thereof the challenges and opportunities that the space sector holds for AM is worth reviewing to provide a better insight into further developments and prospects for this technology. Design/methodology/approach The potentiality of 3D printing for the manufacturing of various components under space conditions has been explained. Here, the authors have reviewed the details of manufactured parts used for zero gravity missions, subjected to onboard International Space Station conditions and with those manufactured on earth. Followed by the major opportunities in 3D printing in space which include component repair, material characterization, process improvement and process development along with the new designs. The challenges such as space conditions, availability of power in space, the infrastructure requirements and the quality control or testing of the items that are being built in space are explained along with their possible mitigation strategies. Findings These components are well comparable with those prepared on earth which enables a massive cost saving. Other than the onboard manufacturing process, numerous other components and a complete robot/satellite for outer space applications were manufactured by AM. Moreover, these components can be recycled on board to produce feedstock for the next materials. The parts produced in space are bought back and compared with those built on earth. There is a difference in their nature i.e. the flight specimen showed a brittle nature and the ground specimen showed a denser nature. Originality/value The review discusses the advancements of 3D printing in space and provides numerous examples of the applications of 3D printing in space and space applications. The paper is solely dedicated to 3D printing in space. It provides a breakthrough in the literature as a limited amount of literature is available on this topic. The paper aims at highlighting all the challenges that AM faces in the space sector and also the future opportunities that await development.

AB To address the environmental challenges associated with Construction and Demolition Wastes (CDW) disposal and the depletion of natural sand resources by the construction industry, this paper investigates the potential use of fine aggregates from CDW as a complete replacement for natural sand in concrete formulations tailored for 3D printing applications. The study begins by physically characterizing fine aggregates produced by crushing and sieving CDW from concrete and fired clay brick residues. This stage includes water content and water absorption capacity tests, specific gravity tests and unit weight tests, and particle size analysis. Then, a 3D printable concrete mix formulated entirely with CDW fine aggregates, replacing 100% of natural sand, is developed using mortar flow and rotational rheology tests. This formulation is validated by printing a medium-sized wall using a 3D printing system developed in-house. Finally, compression tests are performed on printed filaments to examine mechanical properties such as compressive strength and modulus of elasticity. Fresh-state and hardened-state properties are compared with control concrete samples made with natural sand (0% of CDW fine aggregates). The study demonstrates the feasibility of formulating printable concretes with a total replacement of sand by CDW for real-size applications. However, special attention must be given in large-scale projects to the rate of workability loss caused by the high water absorption capacity of CDW fine aggregates. The research findings offer valuable insights into the potential and performance of CDW aggregates in 3D-printed concrete applications within the context of a circular economy.

AB An entry level consumer priced 3d-printer, the MakerBot Replicator 2x, was used to print specimen to conduct tensile, flexural and fatigue testing. Average priced, generic brand PLA material was used (similar to the filament a home user may purchase). Specimen were printed at raster orientation angles of 0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90 degrees to test orientation effects on part strength. PLA filament was also tensile tested.
   Tensile testing of the 3d-printed specimens showed that the 45 degrees raster orientation angle made the strongest specimen at an ultimate tensile strength of 64 MPa. The 0 degrees and 90 degrees raster orientation were not much less at 58 MPa and 54 MPa. A 3-point bending fixture was used to conduct flexural testing on printed specimen. For this type of testing, the 0 degrees raster orientation produced the strongest parts with an ultimate bending stress of 102 MPa. Both the 45 degrees and 90 degrees raster orientations had similar results at 90 MPa and 86 MPa. For the fatigue testing, there was no clear best option, but there was a clearly worst option, the 90 degrees raster orientation. This orientation clearly had lower fatigue lives than either of the other two raster orientations. The other two raster orientations, 0 degrees and 45 degrees, were very similar. PLA filament testing using bollard style grips, showed that the PLA filament exhibited mechanical properties similar to that of printed specimen when tested at high enough strain rates that creep damage didn't play a significant role. This may lead to implications for recycling failed 3d-print jobs and turning it back into reusable filament.

Biological technologies, such as biotrickling filters (BTFs), are preferred due to their cost-effectiveness and ecofriendliness. The selection of the packing materials in these bioreactors is crucial due to their high purchase cost, frequent replacement and impact on the gas-liquid mass transfer. This research aims at evaluating the NH3, H2S and VOC abatement performance of novel packing materials from plastic byproducts from the water cycle at different gas residence times (EBRT). The experimental set-up consisted of three BTFs of 2 L of working volume constructed with three different packing materials: commercial Pall rings (control), recycled plastic (from bottle caps), and extruded recycled plastic materials in the form of an optimised 3D-printed carrier. The three BTFs supported a complete removal of H2S and NH3 at EBRTs of 30, 15, 10 and 6 s, and VOCs removal above 90 % at EBRTs of 30 and 15 s. The extruded recycled plastic materials in the form of optimised 3D-printed carrier supported toluene and alpha-pinene removals of 100 % at EBRTs of 30 and 15 s. The genus Thiobacillus was identified in the three BTFs. This research confirmed the potential of reused and recycled plastics from the integral water cycle as a packing material in BTFs devoted to odour treatment.

DE Self-healing; Cement paste; Vascular network; Embedded 3D printing;
   Two-phase ink
AB Vascular systems for mass recycling promise to endow cementitious materials with self-recovering abilities, which would prolong their durability. However, there is still a lack of strategy in the construction of freeform vasculature with three-dimensional connectivity. In this work, we have developed an embedded printing strategy within cementitious materials, in which a Pickering emulsion gel is developed as the fugitive ink. The proposed two-phase ink allows versatile printing, effective sealing, and can be removed under mild conditions, enabling the formation of freeform, isolated vascular networks. To support the development of embedded printing strategy, we also analyzed the relationships between vessel features, CM hydration, writing speed, and flow rate. The tested aqueous healing agent moves through the printed vasculature to reach and heal cracks, demonstrating the effectiveness of this internal structure in terms of mass transport. We conclude that embedded printing allows the creation of vascular structures in cementitious materials and, ultimately, of intelligent construction materials.

AB This study compares the environmental and economic impacts of three manufacturing methods for continuous fiber-reinforced composites: traditional autoclave molding (Scenario 1) and two 3D printing technologies, one using thermosetting resin (Scenario 2) and the other using thermoplastic resin (Scenario 3). Life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) analyses were performed for components with the same geometry, stiffness, and load capacity. Results show that Scenario 1 has the highest environmental impacts, of about 1.87 kg CO2 eq, primarily due to material waste and energy-intensive curing processes. In contrast, 3D printing minimizes material waste, reducing overall impacts to 1.39 kg CO2 eq, with the thermoplastic-based composites in Scenario 3 offering additional benefits through recyclability. However, due to their lower mechanical properties, thicker and heavier parts are required in Scenario 3, leading to higher impacts in structural applications. Scenario 2 presents a balanced solution with similar mechanical properties to traditional composites and lower environmental impacts (1.30 kg CO2 eq). From what concerns the total costs, Scenario 1 resulted as the most costly solution (<euro> 105.27), while Scenario 3 represents the cheapest alternative (about <euro> 37.89) if high mechanical performances are not necessary. If high mechanical properties are required, the most sustainable alternative both economically and environmentally is represented by Scenario 2. The findings suggest that 3D printing is a promising, cost-effective alternative to traditional methods, particularly for non-structural applications, and point to future improvements in composite manufacturing through material optimization and recycling.

AB This paper focuses on manufacturing and characterization of geometrically complex functional parts fabricated from recycled Inconel 718, a nickel-based superalloy. A novel gas atomization process was used to produce the feedstock for a powder bed fusion process by recycling and melting used Inconel parts. An analysis of the melt-pool geometry and microstructure was conducted using finite element method to determine the optimal print parameters for an EOS M100 3D printer. Densities and mechanical properties of recycled Inconel 718 were tested for various printing parameters using standard test methods and anisotropic tensile behavior of additively manufactured parts were studied. The experimental data were compared with historical and simulated data and indicated equal or better properties compared to the baseline. Chemical composition, microstructure, and fracture surface of broken samples were also examined. Finally, a simulation of the additive manufacturing process was performed using the mechanical properties results and was used to redesign and build a turbine for an automotive turbocharger. The results of this study indicate that scrap Inconel 718 parts can be used to additively manufacture high-quality functional parts.

DE Powder Material; Flow Properties; Dry Granulation
ID COMPACTION
AB Additive technologies currently represent progressive technologies, both in the field of manufacturing itself and in materials engineering, where the main source is powder material. Powder material as a source material is characterized by the mechanical, physical and flow properties of fine powders. Targeted modification of these properties represents a research challenge in this area with the aim of creating a granulate with the required properties. This article compares selected mechanical, physical and flow properties of the original powder material used for 3D printing with the created granulate. The granulate was created by a process of high-pressure compaction between the rolls of a compactor and subsequent dry granulation on a patented flat-die granulator to create a granulate with a narrow particle size distribution. The result is an assessment of the improvement in flow properties for possible material recycling and reuse of the raw material for further processing using 3D printing.

AB Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) presents some challenges when printing with polypropylene (PP)-based materials because they shrink and warp, making it difficult for the materials to adhere to 3D printer build plate/platform. A combination of appropriate thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs), additives, and an optimised material formulation results in significantly improved warpage behaviour of PP-based 3D-printed parts. Two series of experiments were conducted in which PP/maleic anhydride-grafted ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA-M) with and without the addition of an external compatibiliser was tested. An evaluation of the mechanical and thermal behaviour and 3D printability of TPE based on PP/EVA blend compounds at various ratios was performed. Both compatibilised and non-compatibilised PP/EVA-M compounds were successfully prepared and demonstrated to be viable for 3D printing using the FDM method, except for a 30/70 blend ratio for PP/EVA-M and a 30/60/10 blend ratio for the PP/EVA-M/compatibiliser compound. Analysis of the thermal behaviour of selected PP/EVA-M compared to that of virgin PP was conducted to study the relationship between warping and the crystallinity of the blends. The differential scanning calorimeter results revealed that lower crystallisation in TPE blends than in PP compounds reduced warping issues. Furthermore, the 3D printer processing parameters were adjusted to improve adhesion to the 3D printer platform. In terms of enhancing the mechanical properties, the addition of an external compatibiliser improved the mechanical properties of TPE at a specific blend ratio. This paper also demonstrated the feasibility of reusing waste thermoplastic elastomer materials through multiple reprocessing cycles.

AB Flash chemistry controlled organolithium reactions allow redesigning the new economically affordable synthetic routes for life-saving drugs. However, microreactors limit their applications to extend industrial-level productivity. On the other hand, there has been little attention on recycling valuable elements from organic synthesis. In this work, a new compact monolithic metal microreactor was designed to successfully control the lifetime of short-lived organolithium intermediates at a large scale for sub-second scalable synthesis of fenofibrate as an FDA-approved drug for hypertriglyceridemia. Initially, the ultrafast chemistry of highly unstable ArLi intermediate was successfully explored for the synthesis of fenofibrate by its flow-controlled coupling reaction with 4chlorobenzoyl chloride. As needed, by 3D metal printing of the CAD-CFD simulated works, eight laminated serpentine channels integrated with four flow distributors were constructed in a monolithic metal microreactor, leading to improved productivity up to 1.18 g min-1. At the in-line work-up step, the largely consumed Li was completely recovered for the potential recycling of valuable Li resources in a continuous-flow manner.

AB The widespread use of conventional plastics in various industries has resulted in increased oil consumption and environmental pollution. To address these issues, a combination of plastic recycling and the use of biodegradable plastics is essential. Among biodegradable polymers, poly butylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT) has attracted significant attention due to its favorable mechanical properties and biodegradability. In this study, we investigated the potential of using PBAT for direct pellet printing, eliminating the need for filament conversion. To determine the optimal printing temperature, three sets of tensile specimens were 3D-printed at varying nozzle temperatures, and their mechanical properties and microstructure were analyzed. Additionally, dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was conducted to evaluate the thermal behavior of the printed PBAT. Furthermore, we designed and printed two structures with different infill percentages (40% and 60%) to assess their compressive strength and energy absorption properties. DMTA revealed that PBAT's glass-rubber transition temperature is approximately -25 degrees C. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the nozzle temperature enhances the mechanical properties of PBAT. Notably, the highest nozzle temperature of 200 degrees C yielded remarkable results, with an elongation of 1379% and a tensile strength of 7.5 MPa. Moreover, specimens with a 60% infill density exhibited superior compressive strength (1338 KPa) and energy absorption compared with those with 40% infill density (1306 KPa). The SEM images showed that with an increase in the nozzle temperature, the quality of the print was greatly improved, and it was difficult to find microholes or even a layered structure for the sample printed at 200 degrees C.

AB Vitrimers are attracting attention owing to their cross-linked polymer architecture with reprocessability based on an associative covalent adaptable network (CAN). To expand their field of application, intensive research is being conducted to control the properties of vitrimers. Herein, the properties of vitrimers are tuned to render these materials extrudable and weldable. The engineered vitrimer is utilized as a functional "ink" for fused filament fabrication (FFF) 4D printing. The rheological properties of the vitrimers are adjusted by changing the chemical formulation without the use of special chemicals, additional reactions, or unique processes. Using the intrinsic cross-linked architecture of the vitrimers, shape memory performance is demonstrated and used in 4D printing applications. A bond exchange reaction involving transesterification leads to the topological rearrangement of vitrimers, thus allowing them to be reprocessed, reshaped, recycled, and reprinted. In addition, heterogeneous materials in the form of an epoxy vitrimer and ester-containing polylactic acid (PLA) are joined using direct interfacial welding. This study suggests a simple approach to customize the characteristics of vitrimers to confer special properties (shape memory) upon conventionally printed 3D objects, which could be used for soft robot fabrication, the assembly of materials, and multifunctional composites.

AB Material extrusion-type fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3-D printing is a valuable tool for education. During FFF 3-D printing, thermal degradation of the polymer releases small particles and chemicals, many of which are hazardous to human health. In this study, particle and chemical emissions from 10 different filaments made from virgin (never printed) and recycled polymers were used to print the same object at the polymer manufacturer's recommended nozzle temperature ("normal") and at a temperature higher than recommended ("hot") to simulate the real-world scenarios of a person intentionally or unknowingly printing on a machine with a changed setting. Emissions were evaluated in a college teaching laboratory using standard sampling and analytical methods. From mobility sizer measurements, particle number-based emission rates were 81 times higher; the proportion of ultrafine particles (diameter <100 nm) were 4% higher, and median particle sizes were a factor of 2 smaller for hot-temperature prints compared with normal-temperature prints (all p-values <0.05). There was no difference in emission characteristics between recycled and virgin acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and polylactic acid polymer filaments. Reducing contaminant release from FFF 3-D printers in educational settings can be achieved using the hierarchy of controls: (1) elimination/substitution (e.g., training students on principles of prevention-through-design, limiting the use of higher emitting polymer when possible); (2) engineering controls (e.g., using local exhaust ventilation to directly remove contaminants at the printer or isolating the printer from students); (3) administrative controls such as password protecting printer settings and establishing and enforcing adherence to a standard operating procedure based on a proper risk assessment for the setup and use (e.g., limiting the use of temperatures higher than those specified for the filaments used); and (4) maintenance of printers.

AB The escalating environmental and public health threats posed by pesticide-contaminated water sources and underutilized cellulose-rich waste demand urgent sustainable solutions. This study presents an eco-friendly multiplex colorimetric sensing platform that concurrently addresses these dual challenges by repurposing recycled cellulose derived from recycled office paper. The system integrates a 3D-printed cassette with a semi-interpenetrating polymer network (semi-IPN) hydrogel synthesized from recycled cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). The hydrogel demonstrates exceptional water uptake (616 +/- 6 % within 1 min), enhancing rapid analyte diffusion and sensor responsiveness. Enzyme-functionalized cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) immobilized within the hydrogel enable simultaneous, sensitive detection of ethyl-paraoxon and carbaryl, achieving linear detection ranges of 0-1.5 ppm and 0-1.0 ppm, respectively, with high correlation coefficients (R-2 > 0.98). The platform exhibits vivid, naked-eye-readable color transitions across a broad pH spectrum (3-12), ensuring versatility in diverse environments. Validation using spiked tap water samples confirmed its practicality for on-site environmental monitoring, with recoveries aligning with regulatory standards. By transforming waste into a functional material, this work advances low-cost, portable analytical devices rooted in circular economy principles, offering a scalable model for sustainable technology development.

AB Among thermoplastics, polypropylene (PP) is outstanding with respect to its high versatility in terms of its tailoring property profiles for diversified applications, high resource and energy efficiency, environmentally friendly catalytic polymerization process, and recycling capability. However, additive manufacturing of PP by means of fused filament fabrication (FFF), also known as fused deposition modeling, suffers from several drawbacks like high shrinkage, massive warpage, and poor adhesion to common build plates. Herein, we overcome these problems by exploiting glass fiber-reinforced nanophase-separated PP reactor blends (Catalloy process resins). Catalloy is a polymerization process to create PP reactor blends containing dispersed ethylene/1-olefin copolymer rubber nanophases. A warpage quantification method confirms that 3D-printed Catalloy-based PP composites exhibit exceptionally low warpage and successfully compete with amorphous thermoplastics like acrylonitrile-butadiene styrene in printability, build plate adhesion, and printing precision. Microscopic imaging and the measurement of mechanical properties along and perpendicular to the 3D printing direction verify the rapid, highly efficient fusion of the deposited polymer strands. The resulting mechanical properties are very similar to those of injection-molded Catalloy-based composites even at high printing speeds. As evidenced by micro-computer tomography imaging, an unprecedented FFF process-mediated tuning of the fiber orientation is achieved. This allows for precisely tailoring both unidirectional and tuned multidirectional composites via computer design.

AB The microstrip patch antenna (MPA) with a thermoplastic substrate has been widely used in wearable sensors primarily due to its lightweight, flexibility, strength, and compactness. But up till now, little has been conveyed on the use of three-dimensional (3D) printed thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) on cotton-lycra woven (CLW) fabric-based substrate as a wearable sensor. This study presents a novel and scalable approach for characterizing, simulating, and fabricating the substrate for wearable sensor applications. In this study 3D printing of TPU on CLW fabric (70% cotton (on the warp side)-30% lycra (on the weft side) using fused filament fabrication (FFF) process) has been reported with a tradeoff between flexibility and strength (of a substrate for wearable sensor applications). The rheological, mechanical, morphological, four-dimensional (4D), and resonance frequency (RF) characterization of the substrate has been established. As regards rheological properties, the melt flow index (MFI) of primary (1 degrees) recycled TPU was observed as 29.758 g/(10min). Further, the optimized 3D printing settings of TPU were obtained based on the mechanical testing (minimum stiffness, maximum peak strength (PS), maximum Young's modulus (E), and maximum strain energy (SE)) which comes out to be 225 degrees C nozzle temperature, 18 mm/s printing speed and 60% infill density with a stiffness of 3.311 N/mm and PS of 9.628 MPa. The mechanical properties of TPU printed on stretched and unstretched CLW fabric were tested for lower stiffness (more flexibility). To ascertain the mechanical properties, porosity analyses of samples printed on CLW fabric have been performed based on scanning electron microscopy (SEM). For dielectric properties, and RF characterization, the ring resonator (RR) test was performed based on a Vector network analyzer (VNA). Finally, 4D characterization of the substrate was performed by applying a load from 0 to 25 N, resulting in programable RF output (in the industry scientific and medicine (ISM) band).

This study investigates the incorporation of recycled high-density polyethylene (RHDPE) fibers into 3D-printed cementitious composites (3DPCC) as a sustainable solution to improve material performance while mitigating environmental impact. RHDPE fibers with lengths of 6 mm and 12 mm were incorporated into the mortar matrix at varying volume fractions ranging from 0.3 % to 1.5 %. The research systematically examines the influence of fiber length and dosage on the workability, rheological properties, extrudability, buildability and mechanical properties of 3DPCC. Additionally, the study evaluates the potential of RHDPE fibers to reduce the carbon footprint associated with additive construction. The rheological characterization revealed that increasing fiber content and length led to noticeable increase in static yield stress, dynamic yield stress, and plastic viscosity. Notably, the H12-15 mix demonstrated increases of 140.9 %, 90.4 %, and 116.1 % in these parameters, respectively, compared to the control mix (CON), with similar trends maintained after 60 min. Although extrusion efficiency exhibited slight reductions, buildability improved considerably. The maximum buildable height increased from 18 layers in the CON mix to 27 layers in the H12-15 mix, demonstrating the structural advantages of fiber reinforcement. Mechanical testing showed that the incorporation of 12 mm RHDPE fibers enhanced compressive strength (43.10 MPa), splitting tensile strength (4.42 MPa), and flexural strength (12.63 MPa), particularly along the Z-axis, where interlayer bonding is critical. These values represent a 15-20 % improvement over the control mix.
